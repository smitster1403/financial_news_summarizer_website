"Dr Reddy’s counts on biosimilars, weight-loss drug rollout as Revlimid US edge fades",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/dr-reddy-s-counts-on-biosimilars-weight-loss-drug-rollout-as-revlimid-us-edge-fades-13785174.html,"Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd is entering a transitional phase as its once-lucrative generic Revlimid revenue stream dries up, leaving the Indian pharmaceutical player to lean on a pipeline of complex generics and biosimilars to fill the void. The Revlimid cliff The company’s US sales are facing a significant reset. In an interview to Moneycontrol, chief financial officer MV Narasimham, characterised the upcoming period as a temporary disruption. “This anomaly is going to be within the next four quarters... till December 2026,” Narasimham said in a post-earnings interview on January 21. From January 1, investors should expect negligible sales from Lenalidomide (generic cancer drug Revlimid), he added. The impact is already visible. In the December quarter, US revenues slipped by $35 million sequentially to $338 million, primarily due to lower Revlimid contributions and price erosion. Analysts at Equirus Securities remain cautious, noting that while Q3 Revlimid revenues of over $80 million exceeded expectations, the company’s dependence on the product remains a point of concern. ""DRRD's earnings dependence on Revlimid remains high, but its ability to offset the decline through cost controls and scale-up of semaglutide is debatable,"" the Equirus report said. All depends on execution of semaglutide and biosimilar launches Dr Reddy's is pinning hopes on high-value launches, most notably the GLP-1 drug semaglutide. Narasimham confirmed that the company is ""gearing up for the launch"" in Canada, which is managed as part of its US generics business. The Canada launch is anticipated between late February and May. There is no plant inspection required, and the product is expected to be substitutable, the management said during the earnings call. Beyond weight-loss drugs, the company is advancing a robust biosimilar portfolio. The company has filed a Biologics License Application (BLA) for the intravenous formulation with US approval expected by late calendar 2026. Denosumab, another biosimilar, was launched in the EU, with a US launch likely in the second quarter of FY27 or later due to a CRL, while Rituximab US approval is delayed due to inspection needs, the product has already been launched in the EU. Dr Reddy's is getting ready launch Ozempic (semaglutide) generic in India in March. Narasimham said that the company is ""ramping up the teams"" to support these innovations, particularly in the domestic market. Despite the headwinds in the US, the company delivered what Narasimham called a ""resilient"" performance in Q3. Its net sales stood at Rs.8,727 crores ($971 million), a 4.4 percent year-over-year growth. It EBITDA margin at 23.5 percent, but adjusted to 24.8 percent after excluding a one-time labour code provision of Rs120 crore. The management expects underlying EBITDA margin to be around 24.8 percent to 25 percent after adjusting for one-time provisions. As of December 31, 2025, the company had a net cash surplus at Rs. 3,069 crore. While the base business in India and Russia remains strong — growing 19 percent and 50 percent, respectively, — the market's focus remains on how quickly Dr Reddy's can scale its complex pipeline to offset the $250 million quarterly revenue run rate in the post-Revlimid era. At 11.22 am, Dr Reddy’s stock was trading at Rs 1,220.30 on the National Stock Exchange, up 5.25 percent from the previous close.","Narasimham confirmed that the company is ""gearing up for the launch"" in Canada, which is managed as part of its US generics business.","Denosumab, another biosimilar, was launched in the EU, with a US launch likely in the second quarter of FY27 or later due to a CRL, while Rituximab US approval is delayed due to inspection needs, the product has already been launched in the EU.","“This anomaly is going to be within the next four quarters... till December 2026,” Narasimham said in a post-earnings interview on January 21.","Denosumab, another biosimilar, was launched in the EU, with a US launch likely in the second quarter of FY27 or later due to a CRL, while Rituximab US approval is delayed due to inspection needs, the product has already been launched in the EU.",neutral,0.5627506375312805

Dalmia Bharat: Volume outperformance powers Q3 earnings,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/dalmia-bharat-volume-outperformance-powers-q3-earnings-13784983.html,"Highlights India's fourth-largest cement manufacturer, Dalmia Bharat, posted strong Q3 FY26 results, overcoming GST-linked demand disruptions in the previous quarter. Going forward, the management intends to scale the business through capacity additions, geographic diversification, cost optimisation and potential inorganic growth opportunities. Quarterly result highlights Dalmia Bharat outperformed the broader cement market in Q3FY26 with volumes growing 10 percent year on year (YoY) to reach 7.3 million tonnes (MT), comfortably surpassing the industry’s growth rate of 6-7 percent. The Q3 volume figures highlight that Dalmia Bharat has regained the market share it had lost in earlier quarters. The share of sales through trade channels came in at 62 percent (vs 66 percent in Q3 FY25), whereas the premium products mix stood steady around 23 percent. Blended realisations contracted 4 percent quarter on quarter (QoQ), owing to the decline in cement prices after GST revisions. During the last quarter, the southern market witnessed a steep fall in prices due to labour shortages and a slowdown in construction activity. Meanwhile, the eastern markets also witnessed weak price trends on account of Bihar elections. Raw material costs grew just 2 percent YoY despite the additional levy of mineral tax in Tamil Nadu (Rs 160 per tonne). Operating margins expanded by 110 basis points to 17.2 percent, primarily driven by the reduction in freight expenses (down 6 percent YoY), while power and fuel costs were stable YoY. As a result, EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) per tonne came in at Rs 824, up 8 percent YoY. Diversifying manufacturing footprint Dalmia Bharat is targeting a pan-India market presence and intends to reach 75 MT capacity by FY28. The key projects include a 3.6 MT clinker and 3 MT grinding unit at the existing Belgaum plant, and a new 3 MT grinding unit in Pune to strengthen its western Maharashtra presence. Dalmia has commenced commercial production from the Umrangso Clinker line (3.6MT) in Jan-26. The management is also evaluating a 6 MT greenfield expansion in Jaisalmer (Rajasthan), for which land acquisition and mining lease formalities have been completed. Environmental clearance is still pending. The management has given a capex guidance of Rs 4,000 crore for FY26. The company added 143 MW of renewable energy (RE) capacity in 9M FY26, taking its total operational RE capacity to 410 MW. The company is targeting 576 MW of RE capacity by mid-2026. Price trend improving Despite regional pricing headwinds throughout the last quarter, 2026 has started on a strong note with prices firming up by 2–3 percent month-on-month in January across all major territories. However, the key challenges for the sector remain elevated competitive intensity and rising fuel costs. Pet coke prices have increased 15-20 percent YoY, which can constrain margins in coming quarters. Outlook and recommendation The domestic cement sector continues to maintain a positive trajectory, with industry expecting a steady 6-8 percent growth rate due to robust government infrastructure spending, ongoing urban development, and anticipated uptick in private sector demand. Dalmia Bharat’s operational excellence makes it a solid contender in the infrastructure space, though its premium valuation (17.5x FY26 EV/EBITDA) partly reflects the business positives. Therefore, any correction in share price should be viewed as an opportunity to accumulate shares in a healthy company at a reasonable valuation.

Dr Reddy’s stock jumps over 4% today as brokerages turn bullish after Q3 results beat estimates,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/dr-reddy-s-stock-jumps-over-4-today-as-brokerages-turn-bullish-after-q3-results-beat-estimates-13784836.html,"Shares of Dr Reddy’s Laboratories surged over 4 percent in early trade on Thursday after the pharmaceutical company delivered a better-than-expected set of Q3 FY26 results, prompting brokerages to turn more constructive on the stock. The stock outlook turned positive despite a year-on-year decline in profit and continued pressure in the US business. At about 9:20 am, Dr Reddy's shares were trading at Rs 1,208 on NSE, up 4.4 percent from the previous close. Yesterday, ahead of the results, the stock had lost just under 1 percent. Dr Reddy’s reported a 14.4 percent year-on-year fall in consolidated net profit to Rs 1,209.8 crore for the December quarter, smaller than Street expectations of about Rs 1,070 crore. Revenue from operations rose 4.4 percent YoY to Rs 8,726.8 crore, aided by strong growth in India and emerging markets, even as the North America business weighed on overall performance. EBITDA declined 10.8 percent YoY to Rs 2,049.3 crore, while gross margins moderated to 53.6 percent from 58.7 percent a year ago. Dr Reddy's Laboratories stock call: Brokerages upbeat Brokerages said the earnings beat was driven largely by the domestic and emerging markets portfolio, which helped offset weakness in the US. India revenues climbed 19 percent YoY, supported by price increases and the contribution from the Stugeron brand acquired from Johnson & Johnson, while North America revenues declined 12 percent amid a sharp slowdown in Lenalidomide sales. HSBC maintained a buy call on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,435, citing stronger-than-expected sales growth in India and Russia, along with favourable foreign exchange benefits. The brokerage said investor focus now hinges on regulatory approvals for generic semaglutide in Canada and the abatacept biosimilar (IV formulation) in the US, flagging timely approvals as key catalysts for the stock. CLSA upgraded Dr Reddy’s to hold from sell and raised its target price to Rs 1,210, saying the company delivered an earnings beat in Q3. The brokerage highlighted strong growth across India and emerging markets, partly offset by the decline in the US due to lower Revlimid sales. CLSA expects single-digit growth in the US excluding Revlimid and double-digit growth across other geographies, adding that semaglutide has received India approval and is targeted for launch in March, which could support domestic growth momentum. Near-term concerns around Lenalidomide persist, but brokerages broadly believe that sustained growth in India and emerging markets could help stabilise earnings and support the stock over the medium term.

Eternal stock outlook: Brokerages bullish on Zomato after strong Q3 results as Blinkit turns EBITDA-positive,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/eternal-stock-outlook-brokerages-bullish-on-zomato-after-strong-q3-results-as-blinkit-turns-ebitda-positive-13784798.html,"Shares of Eternal Ltd (Zomato) are in focus with the brokerages sharing bullish views on Q3 FY26 results, on the back of a strong quick commerce showing and improving profitability metrics. Ahead of the quarterly results, Eternal stock jumped nearly 5 percent to end at Rs 282.8 on Wednesday. The optimistic brokerage commentary on Eternal's fiscal third quarter results reflects growing confidence in execution, particularly at Blinkit. However, analysts flagged the leadership transition at the top involving founder Deepinder Goyal as a point to monitor. What drove Eternal (Zomato) strong Q3 earnings Eternal, which houses Zomato and Blinkit, reported a 73 percent rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 102 crore for Q3 FY26, in line with estimates, while a tripling in revenue to Rs 16,315 crore. The expansion was led by quick commerce. EBITDA came in at Rs 368 crore, with margins expanding to 2.3 percent. Importantly, Blinkit and Hyperpure turned adjusted EBITDA-profitable during the quarter, marking a key milestone. Zomato stock call: Brokerages see Blinkit inflection as the key trigger CLSA reiterated its 'high-conviction outperform' call on Eternal stock with a target price of Rs 503 per share, implying an upside of nearly 78 percent. CLSA cited Blinkit’s contribution per order beating estimates alongside a 121 percent year-on-year jump in net order value (NOV). The brokerage also highlighted higher-than-expected monthly transacting users, attributing this to consistent pricing and better customer quality; it raised its FY26-28 estimates by 5-15 percent. Jefferies maintained a 'buy' rating with a target of Rs 480, noting that Blinkit delivered positive EBITDA at a time when competitive intensity appears near its peak. On management changes, Jefferies said the transition from founder Deepinder Goyal to Blinkit CEO Albinder Dhindsa as MD & CEO does not alter the near-term outlook, with both leaders continuing their existing responsibilities. HSBC kept its 'buy' call with a target of Rs 350, flagging “multiple positive surprises” in the quarter, including food delivery growth acceleration and quick commerce EBITDA break-even. HSBC also argued that the Q2 slowdown in quick commerce growth was driven by GST changes and seasonality, leaving room for upside to FY27 NOV estimates. Nomura reiterated a 'buy' rating and set a target price of Rs 380. While it said food delivery performance was broadly in line and growth is picking up, Nomura cautioned that quick commerce growth was marginally below expectations despite the surprise break-even, and that the organisational transition warrants close monitoring. It also flagged the risk of prolonged pressure on quick commerce profitability. Management transition in focus Alongside earnings, Eternal announced that founder Deepinder Goyal will step down as MD & CEO and be proposed as Vice Chairman and Director, subject to shareholder approval, with Albinder Dhindsa taking over as MD & CEO. Goyal said he will remain involved at the board level, while day-to-day execution shifts to Dhindsa, who led Blinkit from acquisition to breakeven. Eternal stock performance Eternal shares ended Wednesday nearly 5 percent higher at Rs 282.8, taking the stock’s one-year gains to about 31 percent, well ahead of the benchmark Nifty 50.

The stock is trading around its short-term moving averages (20-DMA and 50-DMA), indicating bullish sentiment, while the RSI is hovering near the lower band (around 35–40), suggesting the stock is close to oversold territory and may see a technical pullback. Momentum indicators remain muted, but selling pressure is gradually reducing near support zones, and some upside momentum may resume in the near-term period. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,744 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,652 UltraTech Cement | CMP: Rs 12,231 UltraTech Cement is showing initial signs of short-term base formation, coupled with healthy trading volumes. On technical indicators, the stock is trading around its key moving averages of 20-, 50-, and 200-day, which are providing support and indicating broader bullish sentiment. Further, oscillators such as the RSI are in neutral territory, suggesting neither strong overbought nor oversold conditions, while MACD readings and some short-term averages indicate cautious momentum. Overall, this suggests price consolidation with a bullish bias. If key support levels hold, the price may move towards the Rs 12,500-plus zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 12,594 Stop-Loss: Rs 12,010 TVS Motor Company | CMP: Rs 3,602 TVS Motor is currently hovering around strong support zones of Rs 3,550–3,600 on the daily charts. Technical indicators are showing mixed signals, with short-term base formation coupled with oversold conditions that may attract some counter-trend buying at the current juncture. On the daily chart, key momentum tools like the RSI are deeply oversold, while oscillators such as MACD and Stochastic suggest oversold zones on short-term momentum indicators. On the other hand, any price break below the Rs 3,500 zone, which is a key support, may suggest a continuation of the ongoing correction, while any sustained move above it may resume short covering in the counter. Resistance for the price is around Rs 3,770–3,790 on the short-term timeframe. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,753 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,512 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities JK Tyre and Industries | CMP: Rs 510.95 JK Tyre has been consolidating in the Rs 525–483 range since December 23, indicating a healthy pause after the prior move. Despite the sideways action, the stock continues to hold above its 20-day EMA, which is acting as a dynamic support. The RSI has reclaimed the 60 level, while the MACD remains above both the signal and zero lines. Holding above the Bollinger Band midline, momentum indicators suggest the stock is well positioned for an upside breakout. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 510–505. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 545 Stop-Loss: Rs 490 One 97 Communications Paytm | CMP: Rs 1,235.9 Paytm had been consolidating in the Rs 1,248–1,357 range since early December, but repeated failures near the Rs 1,355–1,360 resistance zone signalled exhaustion. The stock has now broken below the lower end of this range, closing lower on January 21, confirming a bearish breakdown. Momentum indicators have deteriorated sharply, with the RSI slipping below 40 and DI– crossing above DI+, indicating growing bearish control. The MACD remains below both the signal and zero lines, suggesting further downside risk in the near term. Hence, we recommend selling the stock in the zone of Rs 1,235–1,230 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,265. On the downside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 1,130 in the short term. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 1,130 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,265 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Hindustan Zinc | CMP: Rs 697.55 Hindustan Zinc has been on a dream run, with the ascending chart pattern remaining intact across multiple timeframes. Dips are being bought, and rallies remain strong. The RSI has recently re-entered a bullish crossover, and the price continues to trade comfortably above the 20 EMA. In the short term, the trend is likely to remain strong, with the potential to rally towards Rs 730. Support is placed at Rs 685; a break below this level could lead to a decline. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 730 Stop-Loss: Rs 685 Aditya Birla Capital | CMP: Rs 346.25 Aditya Birla Capital has seen increased weakness following a breakdown from recent consolidation. The stock has also fallen below both the 20 EMA and the 50 DMA, strengthening bearish sentiment. The RSI is in a bearish crossover, indicating the possibility of further downside. In the short term, the trend is likely to remain weak, with the potential to fall towards Rs 331, while resistance is placed at Rs 353, above which sentiment may improve. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 331 Stop-Loss: Rs 353 Havells India | CMP: Rs 1,316 Havells India’s chart looks weak, as the stock has declined after breaking down from recent consolidation. In addition, the stock has been sustaining below the 20 EMA for the last two sessions, confirming a bearish trend. The RSI is in a bearish crossover and continues to fall, further strengthening bearish sentiment. In the short term, the trend is likely to remain weak, with the potential to drift towards Rs 1,280. However, after the sharp fall over the last two days, it would be prudent to sell on rallies rather than at current levels. Resistance is placed at Rs 1,365; a move above this level could improve sentiment. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 1,280 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,365","Hence, we recommend selling the stock in the zone of Rs 1,235–1,230 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,265.","The stock is trading around its short-term moving averages (20-DMA and 50-DMA), indicating bullish sentiment, while the RSI is hovering near the lower band (around 35–40), suggesting the stock is close to oversold territory and may see a technical pullback.","Further, oscillators such as the RSI are in neutral territory, suggesting neither strong overbought nor oversold conditions, while MACD readings and some short-term averages indicate cautious momentum.","The stock is trading around its short-term moving averages (20-DMA and 50-DMA), indicating bullish sentiment, while the RSI is hovering near the lower band (around 35–40), suggesting the stock is close to oversold territory and may see a technical pullback.",negative,0.9654625654220581

"Torrent Pharma takes control of JB Pharma, overhauls board & senior leadership",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/torrent-pharma-takes-control-of-jb-pharma-overhauls-board-senior-leadership-13783837.html,"Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd., on Wednesday told stock exchanges that it has completed its acquisition of JB Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals Ltd., triggering an overhaul of the company’s board and senior leadership. The transaction, which closed on January 21, 2026, involved Torrent purchasing 7,44,81,519 shares, or 46.39% of JB Pharma’s fully diluted equity, from Tau Investment Holdings Pte. Ltd., an entity of US Private Equity firm KKR, under a share purchase agreement signed on June 29, 2025, and amended on July 3, 2025. With the acquisition now consummated—and an additional 1,317 shares picked up through the open offer—Torrent has formally assumed controlling promoter status at JB Pharma. JB Pharma’s board met the same day to record the change in control, acknowledge Torrent as the incoming promoter, and formally reclassify Tau as a public shareholder under SEBI rules. The transition has prompted significant churn in JB Pharma’s governance structure. Three non‑executive, non‑independent directors—Gaurav Trehan, Akshay Tanna, and Prashant Kumar—resigned from the board, citing the change in control and the need to facilitate reconstitution. Each resignation took effect immediately at the conclusion of the board meeting. The shake‑up extended to senior management: Nikhil Chopra, JB Pharma’s Whole‑time Director and Chief Executive Officer, tendered his resignation. He stepped down as Whole‑time Director effective immediately and will continue as CEO only until March 31, 2026, after which he will exit the company entirely to pursue other professional opportunities. In parallel, the company announced a slate of new board appointments backed by Torrent Pharma’s nominations. Aman Mehta, Managing Director of Torrent Pharma, has been appointed Managing Director of JB Pharma for a three‑year term. Mehta, who has played a key role in Torrent’s acquisitions—including Unichem and Curatio—brings deep operational experience and strategic oversight from his decade‑long tenure within the Torrent Group. Three additional directors were also inducted are Amal Kelshikar, a pharma veteran with 32 years of experience across Abbott, Novartis, AstraZeneca, and Baxter, Hasmukh Patel, Torrent Pharma’s Chief Operating Officer and Sudhir Menon, Executive Director (Finance) & CFO of Torrent Pharma. With Torrent now in operational control, JB Pharma's board committees have also been reconstituted effective January 21, 2026, and the company will seek shareholder approval for the new appointments through a postal ballot. Torrent Pharmaceuticals agreed to acquire JB Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals in a landmark transaction valuing JB Pharma at Rs 25,689 crore on a fully diluted basis. As part of this, Torrent purchased the 46.39 percent stake from Tau Investment Holdings (a KKR entity) for Rs 11,917 crore, paying Rs 1,600 per share. Additional components of the transaction include open offer for 26 percent of public shareholding at Rs 1,639.18 per share, totaling Rs 6,842.8 crore, and also acquisition of up to 2.8 percent from employees at the same Rs.1,600 price, costing Rs 719 crore. The transaction strengthens Torrent’s footprint in branded generics and chronic therapies—segments where JB Pharma has long maintained strong franchises in gastrointestinal, hypertension, and pediatric categories. With control secured and management realigned, the acquisition positions Torrent to accelerate portfolio expansion, supply‑chain integration, and margin improvements within its India‑focused growth strategy.","JB Pharma’s board met the same day to record the change in control, acknowledge Torrent as the incoming promoter, and formally reclassify Tau as a public shareholder under SEBI rules.","Additional components of the transaction include open offer for 26 percent of public shareholding at Rs 1,639.18 per share, totaling Rs 6,842.8 crore, and also acquisition of up to 2.8 percent from employees at the same Rs.1,600 price, costing Rs 719 crore.","The transaction, which closed on January 21, 2026, involved Torrent purchasing 7,44,81,519 shares, or 46.39% of JB Pharma’s fully diluted equity, from Tau Investment Holdings Pte.","JB Pharma’s board met the same day to record the change in control, acknowledge Torrent as the incoming promoter, and formally reclassify Tau as a public shareholder under SEBI rules.",neutral,0.9063459634780884
Dr. Reddy’s set for March launch of affordable Ozempic generic in India; ramps up market‑priming efforts,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/dr-reddy-s-set-for-march-launch-of-affordable-ozempic-generic-in-india-ramps-up-market-priming-efforts-13784215.html,"Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories is gearing up to launch its generic version of semaglutide in India on March 21, positioning itself for an early mover advantage in one of the country’s largest chronic disease opportunities. The company confirmed that the first wave of approvals covers the injectable formulation of Ozempic, Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster diabetes drug, with oral and weight‑loss versions to follow. The pharmaceutical major said it is preparing for a “competitive” pricing strategy aimed at boosting affordability and expanding access among India’s growing diabetes population. Executives reiterated that affordability remains a core pillar of Dr. Reddy’s India playbook, though they stopped short of disclosing exact price points. Market estimates suggest generic versions of semaglutide could enter at 50–60% below the innovator. “We would ensure that it is a competitive pricing in the market,” said M.V. Ramana, CEO – India & Emerging Markets, when asked about where Dr. Reddy’s plans to position the drug versus Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic, at company's post earnings media call on Wednesday. “Affordability has been something that is core to Dr. Reddy’s, so that’s the plan as we get ready to launch the product.” Dr. Reddy’s said it is fully equipped to handle demand from day one, drawing on both in‑house facilities and contract manufacturing partners. The company is preparing manufacturing capacity for up to 12 million injectable pens annually through partner channels alone. The drug is fully developed in‑house, including the active pharmaceutical ingredient, and will also be supplied to domestic partners who will market it independently. CEO Erez Israeli added, “we are aiming for about 12 million pens that can come from the partner in one year. And we hope that we can sell all of it or most of it.” Executives confirmed that Dr. Reddy’s has already begun priming the market ahead of the launch. This includes deploying dedicated field forces to promote the drug, running large‑scale medical education programmes with Indian and global specialists, and building a patient‑support ecosystem to help with therapy adherence once treatment begins. The company said its promotional efforts will remain focused strictly on healthcare professionals, distancing itself from cosmetic or off‑label weight‑loss use. Alongside the India rollout, the company is preparing for launches across more than 80 markets over the next 12 months. Canada is among the earliest target countries, with Dr. Reddy’s awaiting a decision on its regulatory submission. Approval could arrive any time between now and mid‑May, allowing the company to launch even before May if regulators clear the product early. Additional priority markets include Turkey, Brazil and several emerging markets where Dr. Reddy’s will sell both directly and through business-to-business partners. The current approval in India covers only the injectable version for diabetes treatment. Market authorization for the oral semaglutide tablet and the Wegovy‑equivalent obesity indication will follow separately once regulatory clearances are obtained. The company said it intends to enter both oral and injectable GLP‑1 formats, reflecting global treatment trends that are expanding rapidly into obesity care. Executives described semaglutide as one of the most significant commercial opportunities for India’s pharmaceutical sector, given rising incidence of diabetes and growing awareness around weight management therapies. The company expects the product to become a meaningful growth driver for its India business beginning FY26. Dr. Reddy’s aims to leverage this launch as part of its broader ambition to climb into the top five pharma companies in the Indian market by the end of the decade—a target driven by a mix of innovative therapies, consumer health growth and strategic inorganic opportunities.",And we hope that we can sell all of it or most of it.” Executives confirmed that Dr. Reddy’s has already begun priming the market ahead of the launch.,"“Affordability has been something that is core to Dr. Reddy’s, so that’s the plan as we get ready to launch the product.” Dr. Reddy’s said it is fully equipped to handle demand from day one, drawing on both in‑house facilities and contract manufacturing partners.",The pharmaceutical major said it is preparing for a “competitive” pricing strategy aimed at boosting affordability and expanding access among India’s growing diabetes population.,"Dr. Reddy’s aims to leverage this launch as part of its broader ambition to climb into the top five pharma companies in the Indian market by the end of the decade—a target driven by a mix of innovative therapies, consumer health growth and strategic inorganic opportunities.",positive,0.9015461802482605
"Taking Stock: Market extends losing streak to third session; Sensex down 271 pts, Nifty under 25,200",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/taking-stock-market-extends-losing-streak-to-third-session-sensex-down-271-pts-nifty-under-25-200-13783642.html,"The Indian equity market extended its losing streak for a third consecutive session on January 21 amid weak global cues, including geopolitical tensions over Greenland and a sharp sell-off in Japanese government debt. The sustained selling pressure dragged the benchmark indices below their 200-day moving averages for the first time in eight months. The market opened on a negative note, and continued selling pushed the Nifty index below the 25,000 mark intraday for the first time since October 6, 2025. However, value buying in select stocks helped the index recover from the day’s low, enabling it to close above 25,100. At close, the Sensex was down 270.84 points or 0.33 percent at 81,909.63, and the Nifty was down 75 points or 0.30 percent at 25,157.50. The broader indices once again underperformed the benchmarks, with the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices declining about 1 percent each.

Click to View More New Listing Shares of Amagi Media Labs ended higher at Rs 348 after a weak stock market debut, having listed at a 12 percent discount at Rs 317 per share on the BSE, compared with its IPO price of Rs 361 per share. Outlook for January 22 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty has fallen below the 200DMA on an intraday basis for the first time in many weeks. It usually shakes the market when the 200DMA is challenged, and it is not going to be just black and white. Over the next few days, the index may remain highly volatile. On the lower end, support is placed at 25,125. A decisive fall below 25,125 could trigger further panic in the market. On the higher end, resistance on a closing basis is placed at 25,200. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing sharp weakness on Tuesday, Nifty shifted into a high volatility with weak bias on Wednesday and closed the day lower by 75 points. Nifty opened on a weak note and continued with negative trend in the early-mid part of the session. Upside recovery has emerged from near 24900 levels in the mid part, but the market was not able to sustain the recovery towards the end and closed lower. A small green candle has been formed on the daily chart with long upper and lower shadow. Technically, this market action indicates a formation of doji type candle pattern (not a classical one), which is reflecting ongoing volatility in the market. Normally a formation of doji after a reasonable decline calls for a reversal post confirmation. The underlying trend of the market continues to be weak. Nifty is finding difficulty in sustaining above the crucial support of 25150 levels (200day EMA). Further weakness below 24900 could possibly drag Nifty down to 24500 in the near term. However, a sustainable upmove above 25200 is likely to open short term bounce back in the market.

Analysts have highlighted which sectors seem attractive at this point of time, ahead of Union Budget on February 1. Sensex plunged more than 1,056 points (nearly 1.3 percent) to hit an intraday low of 81,124.45 on January 21, before seeing a sharp recovery to briefly move into the green and then falling again. Nifty 50 meanwhile fell 313 points (over 1.2 percent) to its day's low of 24,919.8 on Wednesday, which marks a decline of 775 points (more than 3 percent) this week so far. However, after falling below the crucial 25,000-level, the index sharply rebounded before slipping into the deep red again. All the major sectoral indices were in red, with consumer durables, banks and IT leading losses. Broader markets were also in deep red, with smallcap and midcap indices underperforming benchmarks. India's volatility index jumped to 14.43, highest since June, signaling increased market stress. The sharp uptick in volatility highlights elevated intraday swings and fragile sentiment, as reflected in a weak advance-decline ratio, said SAMCO Securities. What to expect from Budget? Citi prefers themes of defence and affordable housing before Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents Union Budget 2026 on February 1. Citi Research expects Union Budget for fiscal year 2027 to offer limited support for consumption and to stay anchored on targeted priorities such as affordable housing and health insurance It sees the government maintaining a strong tilt toward public capital expenditure, with spending budgeted above nominal GDP growth and led by defence outlays. It added that fiscal consolidation must continue even as options to raise tax revenues narrow after major cuts to corporate tax, personal income tax, and the GST regime. Is pre-Budget market crash reason to worry? Markets are correcting ahead of the Budget largely due to global geopolitical uncertainty and risk-off sentiment, not because Indian businesses are fundamentally weak, said Tushar Badjate, Director of Badjate Stock & Share. He added that corporate balance sheets are stable, earnings are largely intact, and India continues to remain one of the strongest growth stories globally. The start of 2026 has been turbulent following complex interplay between global trade uncertainties, aggressive foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows, and the proximity of the Union Budget, said Balaji Rao Mudili, Research Analyst at Bonanza. He added that the primary catalyst for this divergence is the looming threat of US-led trade tariffs following tensions surrounding the proposed Greenland policy and the subsequent threat of tariffs on multiple European and emerging market counterparts which is testing the traditional ""buy the dip"" mentality. The uncertainty surrounding India-US trade negotiations and depreciating rupee has been other factors adding fuel to the fire. Pre-Budget sell-offs tend to be driven more by uncertainty than by a sudden deterioration in fundamentals, and that often creates selective value opportunities, said Anirudh Garg, Partner and Fund Manager, INVasset PMS. “India’s underlying growth, corporate balance sheets and earnings visibility remain intact. For value investors, this correction is throwing up selective opportunities rather than reasons to panic,” he said. Which sectors looks attractive now? Ahead of the Budget, Citi Research flags defence as a preferred theme. It named Bharat Electronics (BEL) as a top pick. It also favours affordable housing plays such as Aavas Financiers and Aadhar Housing Finance. Citi says domestic manufacturing competitiveness could improve if the government overhauls the customs duty architecture. It added that any tweaks to buyback or dividend taxation, or to the STT and capital gains regime, would directly move capital markets and remain key monitorables. The market volatility preceding the budget has unlocked some pockets of value for a long-term investor, said Pranav Koomar, Founder and CEO of PlusCash. Defensive areas like FMCG, healthcare, quality large-cap financial stocks, and some PSU banks look attractive on valuations, the analyst said. He added that capex-linked spaces like infrastructure, defence, and the railway sector will continue to get government outlays, which could be a trigger. In such phases, value investors are better served looking at businesses where earnings visibility remains intact but valuations have corrected due to broader risk aversion, Garg said. He added that rather than choosing between defensives or cyclicals in a binary manner, the focus should be on balance-sheet strength, pricing power, and cash-flow durability. “Traditionally defensive pockets do provide relative stability during volatility, but several economically sensitive areas are also beginning to look attractive after meaningful price corrections, especially where order visibility or domestic demand drivers remain strong. What the market is penalising most right now are stocks that were priced for perfection. As history shows, pre-Budget corrections often reward investors who accumulate gradually, avoid leverage, and stay aligned to companies with sustainable earnings rather than reacting to short-term sentiment swings,” Garg said. Badjate, meanwhile, said that history suggests that during periods of heightened volatility, metals, mining, oil & gas and select PSU stocks tend to outperform as they offer relative stability and act as a hedge against sharp drawdowns in small and mid-cap segments. While defensives (FMCG, pharma, etc) offer a valuation safety net, the primary engines of India's GDP growth are expected to be banking (BFSI) and manufacturing, said Balaji Rao Mudili, Research Analyst at Bonanza. ""In manufacturing, defence sector can be focused due to higher allocation expectation in the budget following need of increasing security on the borders and a push towards indigenization efforts i.e. creating import substitution and promote Make in India initiatives. Additionally, global headwinds leading to war like situations can benefit defence stocks,"" he added. Currently, ""defensives"" like pharma and healthcare offer a margin of safety, while the IT sector gains traction due to attractive valuations and AI-driven growth, said Sanchita Mukherji, Managing Partner, Talk The Walk LLP. ""Simultaneously, value is emerging in policy-driven sectors like Infrastructure, Railways, and Renewable Energy, where long-term government capex remains a structural tailwind. Rather than chasing momentum, investors may educate themselves on quality large-caps and sectors with high earnings visibility, as these ""pockets of value"" typically lead the recovery once the event risk subsides,"" she added. What should investors do? In such uncertain phases, investors should avoid panic selling, except in illiquid, loss-making or very small microcap stocks, Badjate said. ""Commodities can be added cautiously with a long-term view, avoiding aggressive positioning. For investors unsure about direct stock selection, ETFs provide a sensible way to gain exposure. This is a phase to stay disciplined, not emotional,"" the analyst concluded.

The Fluorochemicals business also delivered strong growth, supported by higher volumes and improved realizations.

Some brokerages remained optimistic and increased their target prices for the stock, while some cited valuation concerns. SRF shares meanwhile tumbled more than 5 percent to trade at a nine-month low of Rs 2,730.10 apiece. Both these companies had released their results in the post-market hours of January 20. Persistent Systems Q3 Results: Persistent Systems reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 439.45 crore for Q3 FY26. This marks an 18 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase from the Rs 372.99 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25, but 7 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) decline from Rs 471.47 crore reported in Q2 FY26. The net profit reported in the third quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026 however includes 1.8 percent one-time impact due to the new labour codes. The firm’s revenue from operations rose 23 percent YoY to Rs 3,778.2 crore during the quarter under review. “We are also applying Agentic AI within our own operations, as a ‘customer zero’ to improve productivity and speed adoption at scale, an approach further validated by our recognition as a Microsoft Frontier Firm. As we move ahead, our priority remains sustaining growth through consistent execution as demand continues to shift toward larger, more complex engagements,” said Persistent’s CEO Sandeep Kalra. Along with the Q3 results, Persistent Systems announced an interim dividend of Rs 22 per share for the financial year 2026. The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the payment has been set at January 27. JM Financial on Persistent Systems: JM Financial maintained its ‘Buy’ rating on the stock, and increased its target price to Rs 7,600 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 20 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage said that the firm reported yet another strong quarter in Q3, with revenue meeting elevated expectations. It added that margins beat expectations materially. “PSYS continues to have a competitive edge and is benefitting from AI-led modernization, adoption and data readiness led demand. Its head start with platforms/tools such as SASVA and iAURA, alongside internal AI-led productivity efforts allows it to present a compelling value proposition on cost and speed of delivery to clients, driving deal momentum in our view,” JM Financial said. Choice Institutional Equities on Persistent Systems: Choice Institutional Equities increased its target price for the stock to Rs 7,000 per share, while maintaining its ‘Add’ rating. This implies an upside potential of more than 10 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. “Despite ongoing macro uncertainty, the company has sustained consistent execution, led by its strengthening product engineering capabilities…enhancing its competitive positioning in enterprise AI,” it said. HSBC on Persistent Systems: HSBC held a ‘Hold’ call for the stock with a target price of Rs 6,560 per share, which implies an upside potential of more than 3 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage reported strong growth in Q3 with further improvement in profitability, the firm said. However, it noted that the market expectations seem to be fully priced in the valuation. Nomura on Persistent Systems: Nomura held a ‘Neutral’ call for the stock, with a target price of Rs 6,100 per share. The international brokerage said that the IT company’s growth was in-line with estimates, and margin beat expectations in Q3 FY26. SRF Q3 Results: SRF reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 432.66 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 60 percent YoY rise from Rs 271.08 crore reported in Q3 FY25. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile gained 6 percent YoY to Rs 3,712.53 crore, missing estimates. Brokerage UBS says SRF's medium‑term growth looks constrained due to elevated refrigerant prices, continued Chinese pricing pressure, ongoing weakness in agri‑chem, and management abandoning its 20 percent specialty‑chem growth target.

"Asian shares extend selloff, global bond rout stokes fresh anxiety",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/asian-shares-extend-selloff-global-bond-rout-stokes-fresh-anxiety-13782387.html,"Asian stocks extended their losses for a third session on Wednesday, undone by heightened tensions over U.S. threats to acquire Greenland ahead of President Donald Trump's Davos speech, while a global bond rout appeared to slow for now. Fears of offshore selling of U.S. assets - the so-called ""Sell America"" trade that emerged after last year's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcements in April - gripped markets as Wall Street tumbled over 2% overnight and the U.S. dollar suffered its biggest fall in over a month. That sent investors fleeing to the safety of gold and silver, which both notched record highs. ""The 'sell America' trade was the driving force behind major market moves overnight, as investors looked to reduce exposure to the U.S., seen by many as an unreliable partner pursuing self-defeating policies,"" said Mantas Vanagas, a senior economist at Westpac. Trump, however, doubled down on his rhetoric over Greenland, saying there was ""no going back"" on his goal to control the island, refusing to rule out taking it by force. His threat of tariffs on Europe has also rekindled fears of a global trade war. The European Union will convene an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday to discuss the matter, with the long-standing U.S.-EU alliance clearly at risk. All eyes are now on the World Economic Forum in Davos where Trump is due to deliver a speech on Wednesday. In early trade, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.3%. Japan's Nikkei slumped 1.2%, down for the fifth straight day. Nasdaq futures and S&P 500 futures advanced 0.2% after Wall Street suffered the biggest daily drop in three months overnight. The S&P 500 lost 2.06% while the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.4%. Both EURO STOXX 50 futures and DAX futures fell 0.4%. JAPAN'S BOND ROUT PAUSES FOR NOW The global bond market was still reeling from a brutal selloff, having been caught up in a perfect storm of worries over exposure to U.S. assets and a surge in Japanese government bond yields. Market worries over increased government spending under Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi sent bond yields there skyrocketing to record highs. Investors were trying to catch their breath in early trading. Providing some relief to frayed debt market nerves, the 40-year Japanese government bond yields retreated 6 basis points on Wednesday to 4.145% after surging 26 bps a day earlier to a record high of 4.215%. Liquidity in other tenors remains thin. U.S. Treasury yields were also steady on Wednesday. The benchmark 10-year yield slipped 1 bp to 4.285%, having jumped 7 bp overnight to a five-month high of 4.313% amid the ""Sell America"" fears. Danish pension fund AkademikerPension said on Tuesday it would sell off its holding of U.S. Treasuries, worth some $100 million, by the end of this month, blaming weak U.S. government finances. In the currency markets, the U.S. dollar held steady at 98.56 against its major peers, having dropped 0.5% overnight - the biggest daily fall since early December. The yen was steady at 158.19 per dollar, but lost out on a number of crosses, with the Swiss franc hitting a record high of 200.19 yen. The Bank of Japan meets on Friday and though no rate hike is expected this time, policymakers could flag a tightening as soon as April.

US Bond Yield (Up) Treasuries joined a selloff in global bonds on Tuesday as escalating trade tensions, spurred by proposed US tariffs relating to Greenland, undermined demand for American assets. The yield curve bear steepened as cash trading resumed following a US holiday, with 10- and 30-year yields both climbing three basis points in early Asia trading. Dollar Index (Down) The dollar fell as President Donald Trump continues pushing with his plan on Greenland, sparking risks of a bigger trade rift with Europe. Asian Currencies (Up) Asian Currencies were trading mostly higher in the early trade on Wednesday, with the Thai Baht leading the gainers, followed by Philippines Peso, the South Korean Won, Japanese Won.

Gold (Rises) Gold rose to a record high and silver was near an all-time peak as the worsening crisis over Greenland and a meltdown in Japanese government debt supported haven demand.

The market may consolidate with a negative bias after decisively breaking below the previous week’s low. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities Britannia Industries | CMP: Rs 5,884 After the short-term correction in Britannia from higher levels, the downward momentum has stalled and the stock has entered a consolidation phase over the last few sessions. Moreover, the stock is trading near its important demand zone. The structure suggests a revival of the uptrend from current levels in the near future. For traders, Rs 5,660 would be the key support level to watch. Above this level, the uptrend structure could continue towards Rs 6,300. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,300 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,660 Oil and Natural Gas Corporation | CMP: Rs 240.39 After the sharp up move over the last couple of sessions, ONGC witnessed profit booking from higher levels. However, closing near the important retracement zone and the short-term moving average suggests a bullish continuation chart structure. Therefore, the stock is likely to resume its uptrend in the coming sessions. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 232 could be the trend-decider level for the bulls. If the stock sustains above this level, a further uptrend towards Rs 257 can be expected. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 257 Stop-Loss: Rs 232 HDFC Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 732.1 On the daily timeframe, HDFC Life has been in a downtrend. Therefore, it is currently in oversold territory and is trading near its demand area. The texture of the chart formation and the RSI indicate that the stock is likely to rebound for a new leg of the up move from its demand zone. For positional traders, Rs 705 would be the decisive level. Trading above this level, the uptrend formation may continue towards Rs 785. However, if the stock closes below Rs 705, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 785 Stop-Loss: Rs 705 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Mastek | CMP: Rs 2,223.8 On the daily chart, Mastek has been trending higher for the past one week and has outperformed broader market indices by consistently closing above the previous day’s high over the last three trading sessions, highlighting underlying strength. The stock has already confirmed a breakout from a triangle pattern on the daily chart, which is a positive technical development. Additionally, the Bollinger Bands have begun to expand, indicating an increase in volatility. For now, a sustained move above Rs 2,245 is required for bullish momentum to continue, which could drive prices towards the prior swing high zone of Rs 2,370–2,400, as long as the Rs 2,150 level remains protected on the downside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,370, Rs 2,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,150 Dalmia Bharat | CMP: Rs 2,191.4 Dalmia Bharat has been forming a Cup and Handle pattern since October 2025. In the previous session, the stock gained over 1.5 percent and managed to close near the neckline around the Rs 2,200 level. A sustainable breakout above this zone could pave the way for a fresh rally. The stock continues to form higher highs and higher lows, indicating positive price action. Additionally, the consistent green histogram following a bullish crossover of the MACD provides double confirmation of the bullish outlook. For now, a decisive move above Rs 2,220 may trigger fresh buying interest, which can push prices towards Rs 2,400, the first target as per the length of the handle. On the downside, the Rs 2,110 level is expected to act as key support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,110 JK Cement | CMP: Rs 5,891.5 In the previous session, JK Cement gained 1.84 percent, supported by the highest trading volumes seen since September 19, 2025. The stock has consistently held above the prior day’s low for the last five trading sessions, indicating buying from lower levels. Since November 2025, JK Cement has been trading within a rectangular range of Rs 5,361–6,030, suggesting a phase of accumulation. In the previous session, prices attempted a breakout from this range but failed to close above it. The RSI is currently hovering near 55, indicating the absence of a strong trending move. For now, a decisive breakout above Rs 6,030 could trigger fresh upside momentum towards the Rs 6,450 level, with Rs 5,790 acting as an important support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,450 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,790 Aditya Thukral, Founder & Analyst of AT Research & Risk Managers Delhivery | CMP: Rs 384.85 Delhivery exhibited a box pattern, and a breakdown from this pattern was witnessed on January 12, accompanied by rising volumes. The stock is consistently trading below all its major exponential moving averages, namely the 10-day, 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs, all of which are sloping downwards. An established downtrend is evident, marked by the formation of lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the stock has recorded its lowest close since July 3, 2025. A continuation of the downtrend is expected following the breakdown from the box pattern. Any minor bounce towards the previous support level of Rs 391 will act as a selling opportunity, as prior supports have turned into resistances. Sell Delhivery Futures on a rise around Rs 391, with a stop-loss at Rs 398, targeting Rs 377 over the next two weeks. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 377 Stop-Loss: Rs 398 Suzlon Energy | CMP: Rs 46.34 Suzlon entered a correction phase after forming a top around the Rs 86 level on September 12, 2024. The stock is consistently trading below all its major exponential moving averages—10-day, 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs—and has established a clear downtrend with the formation of lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the stock has closed at its lowest level since June 6, 2024. With prices now moving towards the targets of a bearish flag pattern on the daily chart, and the breakdown occurring with rising volumes, the pace of the downtrend is accelerating due to falling trendlines. This presents a short-selling opportunity in the futures segment. Any minor bounce towards the previous support level of Rs 47.50 should be used as a selling opportunity, as it has now turned into resistance. Sell Suzlon Futures on a rise around Rs 47.50, with a stop-loss at Rs 48.60, targeting Rs 45.20 and Rs 43.50 over the next two weeks. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 45.20, Rs 43.50 Stop-Loss: Rs 48.60 Lodha Developers | CMP: Rs 979.3 Lodha has confirmed a medium-term downtrend with the break of the swing low of Rs 1,035.15, formed during the previous corrective leg. The stock is witnessing another leg of correction after forming a top near Rs 1,530. It is consistently trading below all its major exponential moving averages—10-day, 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs—all of which are sloping downward. The short-term downtrend has now extended into a medium-term downtrend, marked by lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the stock has recorded its lowest close since December 29, 2023. The realty sector has remained under pressure and has been one of the biggest losers during the ongoing correction, underperforming for several months. A continuation of the downtrend is expected in this realty stock, given the established medium-term downtrend. Any minor bounce towards the previous support level of Rs 1,003 should be used as a selling opportunity, as prior supports have turned into resistances. Sell Lodha Futures on a rise around Rs 1,003, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,051, targeting Rs 926 over the next three weeks. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 926 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,051","Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,450 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,790 Aditya Thukral, Founder & Analyst of AT Research & Risk Managers Delhivery | CMP: Rs 384.85 Delhivery exhibited a box pattern, and a breakdown from this pattern was witnessed on January 12, accompanied by rising volumes.","Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 785 Stop-Loss: Rs 705 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Mastek | CMP: Rs 2,223.8 On the daily chart, Mastek has been trending higher for the past one week and has outperformed broader market indices by consistently closing above the previous day’s high over the last three trading sessions, highlighting underlying strength.","In the previous session, prices attempted a breakout from this range but failed to close above it.","Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 45.20, Rs 43.50 Stop-Loss: Rs 48.60 Lodha Developers | CMP: Rs 979.3 Lodha has confirmed a medium-term downtrend with the break of the swing low of Rs 1,035.15, formed during the previous corrective leg.",negative,0.9131601452827454

However, the index is still outperforming the broader Nifty 50 index, which dropped more than 4 percent during the same period. Markets experts have highlighted reasons why the sectoral index remains comparatively resilient amid broader downturn in the stock markets, and what lies ahead. The Nifty Bank index fell 0.81 percent to close at 59,404.20 on January 20, extending decline for the second consecutive session. The index had earlier hit a fresh all-time high of 60,437.35 on January 5, before losing stream. Nifty 50 also had hit its lifetime high of 26,373.20 on January 5, before beginning to decline.

Bank Nifty is exhibiting distinct relative outperformance against the broader market, largely driven by the robust momentum in PSU Banks amid strong quarterly earnings and a broad-based positive trend across the sector, said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart. Notably, the Nifty PSU Bank index hit a fresh 52-week high of 9,093.65 in the early trading hours of January 20, before erasing all gains and falling more than 1.3 percent. Renewed institutional interest, RBI's support The analyst added that this resilience is further underpinned by renewed institutional interest, as mutual funds identify attractive valuations within the banking space, coupled with the RBI's prudent measures to ensure adequate systemic liquidity. Notably, the Reserve Bank of India delivered four interest rate cuts in 2025, reducing the benchmark repurchase rate by a cumulative 125 basis points. In June last year, the Indian central cut the cash reserve ratio (CRR), which refers to the funds that banks are required to hold, by 100 basis points to 3 percent. ""Given these structural supports, the index is poised to remain range-bound in the near term, likely consolidating within the 58,700–60,400 zone as it digests recent gains and builds a base for the next move,"" according to the analyst. Strong balance sheets The fact that Bank Nifty has been relatively less affected in the face of the market correction is a sign that the banking sector has strong balance sheets, steady credit growth, as well as greater earnings visibility, said Pranav Koomar, Founder and CEO of PlusCash. He however cautioned investors, stating that some correction cannot be ruled out, especially in case the general market slide continues. “Nonetheless, any fall in Bank Nifty will probably be more limited in extent, except in case of a drastic macro or liquidity surprise,” he added. Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS, meanwhile said that the relative resilience of the index so far reflects composition rather than immunity. “Unlike the Nifty 50, which has meaningful exposure to global cyclicals and rate-sensitive pockets, this index is tilted toward businesses with steadier cash flows, lower balance-sheet stress, and more domestic demand visibility. That has helped cushion volatility even as the broader market corrected,” he said. Going ahead, the divergence may narrow, but not necessarily through a sharp drawdown, the analyst said. “If global cues remain mixed and earnings momentum softens, some mean reversion is possible. However, a decline matching the Nifty 50 would typically require either earnings downgrades or a macro shock, neither of which is clearly visible yet. In a sideways or mildly corrective market, such indices tend to consolidate rather than correct aggressively. Resilience may moderate, but a one-to-one fall with the benchmark is not a base-case scenario at this stage,” he added. Technical view on Bank Nifty Bank Nifty is still holding its major support zone near 58,650, while Nifty has already broken its crucial support of 25,350–25,400, turning structurally weak, said Drumil Vithlani, Technical Analyst at Bonanza. He added that Bank Nifty remains in a sideways-to-positive range, whereas Nifty has shifted to a clear short-term downtrend after rejection from all-time highs. Bank Nifty is trading near/above its 20-week EMA, showing demand at lower levels, while Nifty has closed below its key EMA, indicating selling pressure, he added. RSI of Bank Nifty is healthier and holding above neutral, whereas Nifty’s RSI is weakening, confirming relative underperformance, he further said. The analyst concluded that Bank Nifty is consolidating and showing resilience, supported by PSU banks, while Nifty has already broken key supports and looks comparatively weaker. Bank Nifty continues to show relative outperformance, maintaining a bullish structure despite mild resistance near 60,200, said Emkay Global Financial Services. A sustained move above this level may fuel further upside, while the 59,200–58,900 zone is expected to act as a strong support cushion, the brokerage said. Axis Securities meanwhile said that Bank Nifty is centered around the 60,000 level, which is acting as a key pivot for the current expiry. 59,500 is a strong support zone, supported by heavy Put open interest, while 60,000 remains the major resistance, marked by the highest Call open interest, according to the domestic brokerage. ""Bank Nifty exhibited relative resilience near 59,800–60,000, but hesitation around 60,000 underscores indecision in the banking complex. A break above 60,000 could revive short-term bullish sentiment, while a breach of 59,500–59,600 might signal extended consolidation,"" said Choice Broking.","A sustained move above this level may fuel further upside, while the 59,200–58,900 zone is expected to act as a strong support cushion, the brokerage said.","The analyst concluded that Bank Nifty is consolidating and showing resilience, supported by PSU banks, while Nifty has already broken key supports and looks comparatively weaker.","The Nifty Bank index has seen some correction in 2026 so far, declining nearly 2 percent after hitting a lifetime high earlier this month.","Strong balance sheets The fact that Bank Nifty has been relatively less affected in the face of the market correction is a sign that the banking sector has strong balance sheets, steady credit growth, as well as greater earnings visibility, said Pranav Koomar, Founder and CEO of PlusCash.",positive,0.9543076157569885

Aarti Surfactants and Tips Music shares meanwhile surged. The three companies had released their results on January 19. Havells India Q3 Results: Havells India shares declined more than 7 percent to close at Rs 1,344.90 apiece. This comes a day after the company reported a standalone net profit of Rs 301.36 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a nearly 7 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from Rs 282.81 crore in Q3 FY25 but a 5 percent QoQ decline from Rs 317.48 crore in Q2 FY26. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose more than 14 percent YoY to Rs 5,573.44 crore during the quarter under review. Along with the Q3 results, Havells India announced an interim dividend of Rs 4 per equity share. The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the payment has been set on January 23. The dividend will then be paid to the eligible shareholders on or before February 17. Brokerages on Havells: Motilal Oswal reiterated its 'Neutral' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,590 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 10 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 1447.1 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that the company’s Q3 results came in below its estimates, as margins remained under pressure across the C&W, Lloyd, and cable segments. “Going forward, the inventory situation of RAC, the implementation of price hikes due to new BEE norms, RM cost inflation, and growth in the C&W segment amid copper price fluctuations will be the key monitorables,” it added. JM Financial said that the firm’s adjusted PAT was a “shade below expectations”, while EBITDA was in-line and revenue was above estimate. “Our FY26E EPS estimate goes up by 3%, primarily on the back of an increase in revenue from C&W, while our FY27/28E EPS estimate is largely unchanged. We maintain BUY with a PT of INR 1,750 (unchanged), valuing Havells at 50x Dec’27E EPS,” the brokerage said. Nomura kept a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,798 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 24 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 1,447.1 apiece. The international brokerage said that the firm’s Q3 earnings beat Jefferies kept a ‘Hold’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,555 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 7.5 percent over the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm’s strong cables and wires growth offset weakness in Lloyd & Lighting. Rising copper and aluminium prices may require calibrated price hikes, it added. Aarti Surfactants Q3 Results: Aarti Surfactants shares jumped 20 percent to hit the upper circuit at Rs 459.10 apiece on Tuesday. This comes after the firm’s net profit grew 358 percent YoY to Rs 3.66 crore in Q3 FY26, from Rs 79.75 lakh in Q3 FY25. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile grew around 28 percent YoY to Rs 207.79 crore during the quarter under review.

Click to View More Outlook for January 21 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Bears resumed control as bulls were increasingly marginalised amid ongoing transatlantic trade tensions. Supports looked fragile as the Nifty kept breaking them on the back of strong institutional selling. Indicators remained in a bearish crossover and are approaching the oversold zone. On the daily chart, the index appears to be drifting towards the 200-DMA. Immediate support is seen around 25,100–25,150. If this level holds, a decent pullback can be expected. Rajesh Bhosale, Equity Technical Analyst, Angel One On the weekly expiry day, Nifty began on a negative note and as prices broke below key support levels, a cascading sell-off ensued, leading to sharp declines through the session. Eventually, Nifty ended the day with a loss of 1.38%, closing tad above the 25200 mark. Over the last 15 days, Nifty has erased more than 1,100 points and in the process has broken multiple key support levels, indicating that weakness may persist in the near term. On the daily chart, prices have slipped below the November swing low and also closed below the golden retracement level (61.8%) of the entire upmove from the September swing low near 24600. On the indicators front, the RSI Smoothened has entered the oversold zone below 25 for the first time since August; however, considering the broad-based nature of the sell-off, attempting to catch the bottom may be premature. From a levels perspective, prices are now at a knocking distance of the long-term 200-DSMA, with 25100–25000 emerging as a crucial support zone for the coming sessions. On the flip side, given the sharpness of the recent decline, identifying a precise resistance zone is challenging; nevertheless, the 25500–25600 region is likely to act as a stiff hurdle. While oscillators are deeply oversold and prices have approached long-term support levels ahead of the key Budget session, we would prefer to remain cautious and not rush to call a bottom until clear reversal signals or a base formation emerge.

The Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 underperformed the frontline indices, falling by up to 3 percent, while the benchmark Sensex and Nifty also traded lower. The Nifty Midcap 100 slipped below its 100-day moving average (DMA) to 57,898.65 during intraday trade, with Oberoi Realty and UPL emerging as the biggest laggards. Shares of real estate companies declined sharply on Monday, led by losses in Oberoi Realty, as investor sentiment turned weak following the company’s Q3 earnings. Oberoi Realty reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 622.64 crore for the October–December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. This represented a marginal year-on-year increase of 0.69 percent from Rs 618.38 crore reported in Q3 FY25, but an 18 percent quarter-on-quarter decline from Rs 760.26 crore recorded in the previous quarter (Q2 FY26). The Nifty Smallcap 100 index extended its losing streak for a third consecutive session, falling over 4 percent during the period. Newgen Software Technologies, Data Patterns (India), Ola Electric Mobility and Aditya Birla Real Estate emerged as major laggards in the index, with their shares declining by as much as 12 percent. Shares of Ola Electric Mobility slipped 5.5 percent to Rs 33.7, hitting their lowest level in nearly a month, after the electric vehicle maker announced the resignation of its Chief Financial Officer Harish Abichandani due to personal reasons. The company said Deepak Rastogi has been appointed as the new CFO with effect from January 20. The stock marked its tenth consecutive session of decline and has fallen 57.7 percent so far in 2025. N ArunaGiri, CEO of TrustLine Holdings, said ""It has been a one-way fall for the small-cap index since the start of November last year. At the index level, small caps are down over 11.5% since then. That alone looks painful, but the reality beneath the surface is far worse. Even in the current month, from January 1st, the small-cap index has fallen by about 7.5%. And this is only the aggregate picture. When we go deeper, the stock-specific carnage is severe. A large number of stocks are down 40–50%. In fact, one could argue that nearly half the market, particularly across the small-cap spectrum, has seen drawdowns of this magnitude."" ""The pain in mid caps is equally intense. Given the extent of the fall and the brutality of the correction, the obvious question arises: Has this become a buy-on-dips market? Unfortunately, the answer is no. Valuations remain meaningfully above historical averages. Before this correction, the small-cap index was trading at around 28–30x trailing earnings. Post the fall, valuations have moderated to about 25–26x, but this is still a huge premium to long-term averages. So at a broader market level, small and mid caps continue to look expensive, and it would be naïve to rule out more pain in the space. Does that mean investors should simply sit on the fence and wait for much lower levels? That approach is equally not prudent. At the stock-specific level, for truly bottom-up and selective investors, many compelling opportunities are emerging across small and mid caps, provided one is extremely choosy. In that sense, this is not a universal buy-on-dips market, nor is it a market to completely stay out of. It is a market that rewards selective bottom-up stock-specific approach. That, in essence, is the story emerging from the current small- and mid-cap carnage. Time to be choosy, selective and bottom-up,"" he added. Extending its previous day's decline, the Sensex tumbled 1,065.71 points, or 1.28 percent to settle at 82,180.47. During the day, it dropped 1,235.6 points, or 1.48 percent to 82,010.58. The Nifty tanked 353 points, or 1.38 percent to end at 25,232.50, marking its steepest single day decline since April 7, 2025.

Despite having negative seasonality in Capco, the organic growth (0.6% QoQ CC) was positive and multi-faceted across business units, including Fin. Services. However, the organic growth momentum is less likely to sustain in Q4 due to execution deferment in one of the large deals, especially the NN component. The softness in business is also baked into Q4 organic guidance of -1.5 to +0.5 QoQ CC (our assumption), which translates to twomonth inorganic contribution of +1.5% QoQ. Again, the organic guidance comes at the back of improving Capco seasonality in Q4, which is little discouraging. Although 9MFY26 large deals (+77% YoY) and bookings (+25% YoY) have improved, the execution remains a challenge. On the margins front, we expect the full integration of Harman will dilute Service margins in FY27 before it sees integration benefits achieved in FY28E. Outlook We are baking in revenue growth of -1.3%/+3.8/4.4% YoY CC, while keeping our Adj. IT Service margin estimates at 17.4%/17.1%/17.5% for FY26E/FY27E/FY28E, respectively.

The engagement within Aerospace is progressing well and moving upstream to complex engineering activities, it now anticipates Aerospace to become USD40m revenue in FY26. The management was confident of reversing Q3 weakness and deliver double-digit growth in Q4 on the back of stabilizing operations of its Anchor account along with a ramp up in Auto programs (signed in Q3). The continued momentum in Aerospace & IHM, securing large program on full-vehicle development, and early signs of spending recovery in auto OEMs give confidence to the management to drive double-digit organic growth in FY27. However, we believe the high base in Q4 and the lumpiness in Tech Solutions pose incremental risks to achieving doubledigit growth, especially as the auto recovery remains in limbo.

BHEL delivered a revenue growth of 16.4% YoY with EBITDA margin expanding by 225bps YoY aided by lower other expenses (vs higher base in Q3FY25) partially offset by decrease in GM. Execution in the Power segment remained slower, translating into ~13% YoY revenue growth despite a healthy Rs1.7trn order backlog, supported by recent Rs66.5bn EPC package win (1×800MW) from NTPC, reinforcing BHEL’s positioning in the thermal space. In contrast, the industry segment continued to deliver strong execution with revenue up 27.4% YoY, driven by accelerating traction across transmission, transportation, oil & gas and defense verticals; however, order inflows in Industry moderated sharply to Rs16.3bn (vs. ~Rs57bn in Q3FY25 on a high base). While near-term challenges around execution intensity persist, a robust pipeline and a gradual shift towards non-Power opportunities with rise in public/private capex, BHEL is well placed for sustained growth.

Although top 5/10 accounts de-grew 2.9%/1.1% TTM (vs decline of 5.2%/2.2% LQ), the pace of deceleration has reduced sequentially, implies recovery post productivity benefits. The management was confident of executing even better and aspired to achieve near to double-digit YoY growth in Q4. The company’s participation in vendor consolidation deals along with continued momentum in NN wins translate to a better growth visibility. The recent Indialed NN deal (CBDT) would itself contribute ~80-90bps to the topline in FY27. On margins, it was able to sustain margins at a Q2 high base despite having pass-throughs, aided by internal margin program (fit-for-future) and INR depreciation supporting margins in Q3.

The sharp fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty Realty index down more than 4 percent to 798.90, as seen at 1.50 pm, to emerge as the top sectoral loser today and recording decline for the third consecutive session. The sectoral index has now fallen for nine out of 10 sessions, dropping more than 13 percent during the period. The sectoral index is set to record the sharpest single-day plunge since July 2025. Oberoi Realty Q3 Results: Oberoi Realty on Monday reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 622.64 crore for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. This marked a marginal rise of 0.69 percent from the Rs 618.38 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25, but an 18 percent QoQ fall from the Rs 760.26 crore net profit reported in the previous quarter (Q2 FY26). The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose 6 percent YoY but fell more than 16 percent QoQ to Rs 1,492.64 crore during the quarter under review. Along with the Q3 results, Oberoi Realty announced a third interim dividend of Rs 2 per equity share for the financial year 2025-2026. The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the payment has been set at January 23. The dividend will be paid to the eligible shareholders on or before February 5. ""In 2026, we will continue to actively pursue attractive land opportunities, and we remain optimistic about the year ahead, supported by a strong development pipeline, prudent capital management, and our unwavering focus on creating future ready projects aligned with long-term market demand,"" said Vikas Oberoi, Chairman & Managing Director of Oberoi Realty. JP Morgan remains 'Overweight' on the stock, with a target price of Rs 2,050 apiece which implies an upside potential of nearly 24 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the numbers are relatively weak. If pre-sales numbers continue to disappoint, the stock's outperformance could narrow, the firm added. Top realty losers today: Oberoi Realty shares were the top loser on the index, dropping around 9 percent to trade at Rs 1,510.90 apiece. Sobha, Prestige Estates and Macrotech Developers (Lodha) shares meanwhile fell around 6 percent each. Heavyweight Godrej Properties and DLF shares dropped around 5 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Anant Raj and Phoenix Mills shares fell around 3 percent each. Brigade Enterprises and Signature Global shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. What lies ahead? Indian IT sector has seen mass layoffs last year, which have now spilled over to this year. According to analysts, the IT layoffs have impacted housing demand in key areas, thereby impacting the stocks. IT layoffs are likely to be the major reason for the low demand in the luxury segment of urban centers like Bangalore and Hyderabad as they will be discouraging the high-income buyers, said Shashank Gupta, Director, RPS Group. He added that mid-to-premium housing sales, which have already dropped 15 percent year-on-year, will continue to be affected negatively as the professionals will not be willing to upgrade, opting instead to rent amid such job uncertainties.

Accumulate Tech Mahindra; target of Rs 1860: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/accumulate-tech-mahindra-target-of-rs-1860-prabhudas-lilladher-13780885.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tech Mahindra The revenue growth (+1.7% CC QoQ) exceeded our estimates (+0.5% CC QoQ), aided by Communications (+2.8 QoQ) and seasonal ramp up within Europe automotive. The growth was broad-based across verticals, except BFSI (down 6.3%) on account of passing productivity benefits. Although Comviva seasonality contributed notably in Q3, the growth beyond Comms was encouraging (+1.2% QoQ), reported third consecutive quarter of growth. Management was confident of sustaining momentum within Comms in FY27, backed by NN 5-year strategic win (USD500m) with a European Telco that itself will contribute ~1% to the topline. The 9MFY26 deal TCV looks encouraging at USD2.7b (+44% YoY), which is coming over and above 42% YoY TCV growth delivered in FY25. The quarterly TCV run-rate of USD800m-USD1b is likely to be sustained, which is sufficient to achieve its aspiration of outpacing the peer average topline growth. We believe the restructuring exercise has largely calibrated margins to a comfort band, now it requires paddling more on the orchestrated large wins. On margins, we believe the cost optimization efforts would continue (leveraging project Fortius), while growth acceleration would also provide operating leverage to scale another ~200bps YoY in FY27. Outlook We are baking in revenue growth of +1.0/+5.5%/5.9% CC YoY with margin improvement of 270bps/200bps/50bps YoY in FY26E/FY27E/FY28E.

Analysts flagged concerns around margins and near-term earnings visibility despite largely in-line performance. The stock was trading at Rs 6,012.5 in morning deals, down 6.2 percent on the day. Over the past one year, LTIMindtree shares have gained just over 3 percent, significantly underperforming the benchmark Nifty 50, which is up about 9 percent over the same period. Brokerages said that LTIMindtree delivered an in-line quarter, but diverged on the outlook and valuation comfort. CLSA reiterated its ‘Outperform’ rating with a target price of Rs 7,067 per share, implying an upside of over 17 percent. The brokerage expressed confidence in the company’s guidance for a return to double-digit revenue growth by Q4 FY26. CLSA pointed out strong large deal wins across BFSI, public markets, and consumer and media segments, noting that deal ramp-ups should offset productivity gains from AI adoption. However, it flagged limited scope for near-term re-rating, arguing that future upside will be driven primarily by EPS growth rather than valuation expansion. Morgan Stanley maintained an ‘Equal-weight’ stance with a target price of Rs 6,300, citing positives such as growth in a top hi-tech client and signs of BFSI bottoming out. At the same time, it cautioned that near-term margin pressure remains a concern, resulting in a balanced risk-reward at current valuations. More cautious views came from Nomura and Citi. Nomura retained a ‘Neutral’ rating with a target price of Rs 5,900, pointing to a Q3 performance ranging from in-line to a modest miss, with EBIT margin at 16.1 percent coming in below estimates. It also flagged the one-time labour law provision of Rs 590 crore as a key drag. Citi, which has a ‘Sell’ call and a target price of Rs 5,415, said revenue was aided by seasonal pass-throughs and margins benefited from lower SG&A expenses, but warned that upcoming wage hikes could dent margins by around 100 basis points over Q4 and Q1. LTIMindtree on Monday reported a 12 percent year-on-year decline in net profit to Rs 960 crore for the December quarter, largely due to a one-time labour code-related charge of Rs 590.3 crore. Sequentially, profit fell over 30 percent. Revenue rose 11 percent year-on-year to Rs 10,781 crore, while operating margin improved 20 basis points sequentially to 16.1 percent. Excluding the labour code impact, net profit would have grown 29 percent year-on-year, the company said. Management commentary remained constructive, with CEO and MD Venu Lambu highlighting strong deal momentum, AI-led strategy execution, and a third consecutive quarter of over 2 percent sequential growth.

The shares of the company hit a new 52-week high of Rs 696.90 apiece in the morning trading hours of Tuesday. Hindustan Zinc Q3 results: Hindustan Zinc on January 19 reported a standalone net profit of Rs 3,879 crore for the October-December quarter of FY26. This marked a 46.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from the Rs 2,647 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. Revenue from operations meanwhile rose 27.5 percent YoY to Rs 10,922 crore during the quarter under review, as against a revenue of Rs 8,556 crore in the year-ago period. EBITDA increased 34.7 percent YoY to Rs 6,055 crore, while EBITDA margin expanded to 55 percent from 52 percent a year ago, supported by lower zinc cost of production and improved operating leverage. According to the company, Q3 marked its highest-ever quarterly revenue and profit, driven by higher metal production, stronger zinc and silver prices, and a sharp reduction in costs. Soaring silver prices: Silver prices hit fresh lifetime highs today, as tensions between US and EU simmered over President Donald Trump’s constant threats to annex Greenland. Silver futures with March expiry gained around 3 percent to hit a fresh all time high of Rs 3,18,729 per kilogram. The future contracts with May and July expiries meanwhile rose more than 3 percent to hit fresh lifetime highs of Rs 3,28,854 per kilogram and Rs 3,35,885 per kilogram, respectively. Hindustan Zinc is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity. HSBC on Hindustan Zinc: HSBC kept a ‘Buy’ call on the shares of Hindustan Zinc, with a target price of Rs 750 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 14 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 660.4 apiece. The company’s Q3 earnings beat estimates due to higher volumes and lower costs, HSBC said. It added that strong silver prices should further lift earnings. The firm expects Q4 results to be even stronger due to higher volumes and sharply higher silver prices. Jefferies on Hindustan Zinc: Jefferies raised its target price for the stock to Rs 750 per share, while maintaining its ‘Buy’ rating. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 14 percent from the previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm benefitted from rising silver and zinc prices. It raised FY26-28 EPS estimates by 3–10 percent, as costs remain under control. It expects the company to post 47 percent YoY EPS Growth in FY27, followed by 6 percent In FY28. Jefferies further said that Hindustan Zinc’s valuation at 9.4x FY27 EV/EBITDA as against a long-term average of 7.3x is justified by rising silver share in EBIT. Citi on Hindustan Zinc: Citi however kept its ‘Sell’ call on the stock with a target price of Rs 585 per share, which implies a downside potential of more than 11 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The firm said that Hindustan Zinc’s Q3 EBITDA rose 35 percent YoY driven by better silver prices, lower costs & higher volumes. The company is targeting 2 percent refined volume growth in FY26 & CoP of $1,000. Nuvama on Hindustan Zinc: Nuvama kept a ‘Reduce’ call on Hindustan Zinc shares, with a target price of Rs 591 apiece. This implies a downside potential of more than 10.5 percent over the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm’s Q3 EBITDA was in-line with its estimates. Silver EBIT surged 56 percent QoQ, and accounted for 44 percent of EBIT. Nuvama lifted its EBITDA estimates by 28 percent for FY27 and 21 percent for FY28, assuming that the average zinc and silver prices of $3,000 and $60 for FY27, and $2,900 and $55 for FY28, respectively.

LTIMindtree Q3 FY26 – Is the price already discounting the strong quarter?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/ltimindtree-q3-fy26-is-the-price-already-discounting-the-strong-quarter-13780264.html,"Highlights LTIMindtree (LTIM, CMP: Rs 6407, Market Cap: Rs 189,960 crore, Rating: Overweight) reported a good Q3 FY26 with a strong sequential surge in revenue despite the seasonality, uptick in margin, and steady deal flow. The management remains optimistic about clocking close to double-digit YoY growth in revenue in Q4 and maintaining the momentum in FY27. The stock has been an out-performer in the IT pack and has performed in line with the Nifty in the past year. While the headline valuation isn’t cheap, the growth journey makes us constructive. Strong surge in revenue Revenue for the last reported quarter Q3 FY26 at $1208 million represented a sequential growth of 2.4 percent in reported currency and in Constant Currency (CC). The reporting quarter (Q3FY26) saw strong performance from Healthcare, Life Sciences & Public Services, followed by Manufacturing & Resources. The Consumer business had a positive sequential growth. Weakness was seen in BFSI (banking financial service and insurance) and Technology, Media & Communication because of a combination of furloughs and productivity passthrough in some top accounts. All the three key markets of North America, Europe, and the Rest of the World (RoW) had a positive sequential growth. The PAN deal from India had a positive rub-off on RoW. Weakness in top accounts transitory Unlike the strength in the overall business, the top 5 accounts (which include the top hitech and BFSI account) de-grew YoY 8.7 percent and a sequential 2.9 percent in Q3 FY26. The temporary impact has been on account of recalibration as LTIM has passed on AI-driven productivity gains to customers. The top hi-tech account has started growing sequentially and the BFSI segment and the top account is likely to bottom out in Q4. The impact of the AI-led productivity gains is more meaningful in large engagements and the management expects growth momentum from these large accounts to resume from FY27. Guiding to margin stability LTIM’s EBIT margin expanded 20 basis points QoQ in Q3 FY26 to 16.1 percent. Tailwinds from the Fit-for-Future efficiency gains programme and forex were partially offset by furloughs and lower working days. The management remains confident of sustaining margin improvement supported by levers, including AI-driven productivity gains, pyramid optimisation through fresher hiring, and continued cost discipline. It has started a new programme called New Horizon for steady focus on cost and margin. The likely wage hike in Q4 to be spread over two quarters is likely to cause 1 percent margin headwind each quarter. LTIM reported a net headcount addition of 1,511 employees in Q3FY26, including 1736 freshers, taking the total workforce to 87,958. This further bolsters confidence on future execution.

Indian equities began the week on a subdued note, with the Nifty falling below 25,500 intraday as weak global cues triggered broad-based profit booking. The renewed concerns over a potential global trade war and mixed earnings weighed on sentiment. However, select buying in FMCG and auto stocks provided support, helping the benchmarks recover from the day’s lows. At close, the Sensex was down 324.17 points or 0.39 percent at 83,246.18, and the Nifty was down 108.85 points or 0.42 percent at 25,585.50.

US Equities (Shut) US equity markets were closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. US Bond Yield (Up) Treasuries joined a selloff in global bonds on Tuesday as escalating trade tensions spurred by proposed US tariffs relating to Greenland undermined demand for American assets. The yield curve bear steepened as cash trading resumed following a US holiday, with 10- and 30-year yields both climbing three basis points in early Asia trading. Dollar Index (Slips) The dollar retreated to its lowest level in a week in early trading on Monday after threats from the White House towards the European Union over the future of Greenland triggered a broad selloff across U.S. stocks and government bonds. Asian Currencies (Mixed) The won slips as South Korea’s stock benchmark looks set to end a 12 day rally, with fading risk appetite from US Europe tensions and firm dollar demand underpinning the exchange rate. The yen edged higher against the dollar, gaining as much as 0.2% to 157.85. Crude (Up) Oil prices rose on Tuesday after better-than-expected economic growth data from China lifted demand optimism, with markets also watching President Donald Trump's threats of increased U.S. tariffs on European nations over his desire to buy Greenland. Gold (Flat) The precious metals trade flat, after rising sharply in the previous session following Trump’s pledge to put tariffs on eight European nations that opposed his Greenland ambitions.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Tata Elxsi, Colgate Palmolive, Shriram Finance, Canara Bank, CCL Products, and others on January 20?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-tata-elxsi-colgate-palmolive-shriram-finance-canara-bank-ccl-products-and-others-on-january-20-13779904.html,"Equity benchmarks declined four-tenths of a percent on January 19, with market breadth consistently favouring bears. About 2,190 shares were under pressure against 728 shares that advanced on the NSE. The market is expected to consolidate and trade within the previous week’s range. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Bajaj Auto | CMP: Rs 9,429.5 Bajaj Auto has entered a healthy pullback phase after breaking out above its long-term falling trendline, as visible on the chart. Such pullbacks are often considered constructive, as they allow prices to consolidate and attract fresh buying interest without damaging the overall trend structure. From an indicator perspective, the Directional Movement Index (DMI) shows the positive line clearly in control, suggesting that buying strength remains dominant. The Average Directional Index (ADX) is holding above the 20 level, indicating that the trend is gaining stability and strength rather than weakening. Meanwhile, the MACD remains above the zero line, reflecting positive momentum and supporting the continuation of the bullish trend. Based on this technical combination, the pullback is viewed as an opportunity rather than a sign of weakness. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 9,450–9,400 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 10,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 9,000 Balkrishna Industries | CMP: Rs 2,431.6 Balkrishna Industries has shown a strong improvement in its technical structure, supported by multiple bullish signals. The 9- and 26-DEMA have delivered a bullish crossover, indicating a shift in short-term momentum in favour of the bulls. In addition, the stock has confirmed a breakout above its falling trendline, suggesting a change in the medium-term trend. Momentum indicators further strengthen the positive outlook. The DMI has recorded a bullish crossover, reflecting increasing buying pressure, while the MACD has moved above the zero line, highlighting a transition into positive momentum territory. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 2,410–2,400 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,300 Tata Elxsi | CMP: Rs 5,563 Tata Elxsi has successfully retested its breakout zone, as highlighted on the chart, confirming the strength and sustainability of the recent breakout. Notably, volumes are picking up near lower levels, indicating strong accumulation interest and reinforcing the positive price structure. The breakout above the falling trendline further supports a shift in the medium-term trend from bearish to bullish. On the momentum front, the MACD is positioned above the zero line, signalling positive momentum, while the DMI continues to reflect bullish dominance. Additionally, the ADX is holding above the 25 level, suggesting that the emerging trend is gaining strength and reliability. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 5,600–5,500 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,250 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,200 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Colgate Palmolive India | CMP: Rs 2,178 Colgate Palmolive has provided a breakout from the falling trendline, accompanied by a decrease in open interest, indicating short covering. There had been heavy short positions in the stock, and it had declined nearly 50 percent from its all-time high. Significant positive divergence is visible on both daily and weekly charts, indicating a higher probability of continued short covering. The risk-to-reward ratio is clearly in favour of the bulls; hence, one may initiate long positions in this series. Options data indicates that the Rs 2,200 strike has the highest Call base, and a close above this level could lead to further upward momentum. Buy Colgate Palmolive futures in the range of Rs 2,170–2,190. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,250, Rs 2,300 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,120 Mankind Pharma | CMP: Rs 2,117.2 Mankind Pharma has been forming lower tops and lower bottoms, with an increase in open interest clearly indicating short build-up in the near term. Hence, the short-term trend remains negative. A bounce witnessed a few weeks ago was largely due to short covering, and once that move ended, the stock resumed its primary downtrend, with fresh additions on the short side. There is a huge Call base at the Rs 2,200 strike, and the stock has closed significantly below this level. The maximum pain is also at the Rs 2,200 level. Until this level is decisively crossed, the short-term trend is likely to remain weak. Any bounce should be utilised as a selling opportunity. Sell Mankind Pharma futures in the range of Rs 2,120–2,140. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 2,060, Rs 2,020 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,180 HCL Technologies | CMP: Rs 1,716.8 HCL Tech has been moving higher following its Q3 results, indicating a bullish short-term trend. There has been a decrease in open interest along with a rise in price, suggesting short covering. Large-cap IT stocks have largely witnessed short build-up, with heavyweights such as Wipro, TCS, and Infosys still carrying substantial short positions. Meanwhile, midcap IT stocks have been outperforming large caps. Despite this, HCL Tech has emerged as an outperformer within the large-cap IT space and has been gradually forming higher tops and higher bottoms. As per options data, once the stock closes above the Rs 1,720 level, which has the highest Call base, it is likely to move towards the Rs 1,800 level. Buy HCL Tech futures in the range of Rs 1,700–1,720. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,760, Rs 1,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,645 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital Shriram Finance | CMP: Rs 1,010.35 Shriram Finance continues to exhibit a robust structural uptrend across timeframes, characterised by a classical higher-top and higher-bottom price formation. On the weekly timeframe, the stock is firmly placed above its key 12- and 26-week EMAs, underscoring strong trend strength. The MACD momentum indicator is trending higher, reflecting acceleration in upside momentum and reinforcing the bullish bias. On the daily chart, the stock has displayed a bullish mean reversion from the 12-day DEMA, further validating the positive outlook and suggesting continuation of the prevailing uptrend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,081 Stop-Loss: Rs 970 Canara Bank | CMP: Rs 156.86 Canara Bank has recently displayed strong positive structural developments on the higher timeframe. During the October series, the stock witnessed a decisive breakout above its multi-year swing highs of 2010 and 2024, marking a transition into uncharted territory. The stock is firmly sustaining above its 12-, 26-, and 50-period DEMA, while continuing to form higher tops and higher bottoms, highlighting strong relative strength amid prevailing market volatility. Momentum indicators further validate this strength, with the MACD remaining in buy mode, reinforcing that the ongoing uptrend is well supported by positive momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 172 Stop-Loss: Rs 150 Bharat Electronics | CMP: Rs 412.8 BEL has been in a robust long-term uptrend since 2020, consistently demonstrating resilience on the monthly timeframe. On the weekly chart, the stock continues to form higher bottoms and is currently consolidating around its 26-week EMA, indicating healthy price digestion within an ongoing uptrend. On the daily timeframe, BEL maintains a higher-top and higher-bottom structure. Notably, during recent pullbacks, the stock has displayed a repetitive price behaviour wherein corrections tend to remain contained at around 4 percent, after which the stock resumes its upward trajectory. This recurring pattern reinforces the strength of the prevailing trend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 447 Stop-Loss: Rs 400 CCL Products India | CMP: Rs 983.75 CCL Products has been on a sustained upward trajectory since 2020, forming a sequence of higher tops and higher bottoms on the monthly timeframe, a classic indication of a long-term bullish trend. On the weekly chart, the stock has exhibited a bullish mean reversion from the 26-week EMA, while the Stochastic oscillator remains in buy mode, reinforcing the positive outlook. On the daily timeframe, the stock has witnessed a reversal from the 2025 gap support, further validating the underlying strength and confirming a constructive near-term sentiment. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,101 Stop-Loss: Rs 944","On the daily chart, the stock has displayed a bullish mean reversion from the 12-day DEMA, further validating the positive outlook and suggesting continuation of the prevailing uptrend.","Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 447 Stop-Loss: Rs 400 CCL Products India | CMP: Rs 983.75 CCL Products has been on a sustained upward trajectory since 2020, forming a sequence of higher tops and higher bottoms on the monthly timeframe, a classic indication of a long-term bullish trend.","Such pullbacks are often considered constructive, as they allow prices to consolidate and attract fresh buying interest without damaging the overall trend structure.","On the daily chart, the stock has displayed a bullish mean reversion from the 12-day DEMA, further validating the positive outlook and suggesting continuation of the prevailing uptrend.",positive,0.9264390468597412

"India’s healthcare deals top Rs 10,000 crore in Q2FY26 as hospitals, diagnostics lead expansion: EY",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/india-s-healthcare-deals-top-rs-10-000-crore-in-q2fy26-as-hospitals-diagnostics-lead-expansion-ey-13779668.html,"Indian healthcare sector delivered one of its strongest quarters in recent years, clocking over Rs 10,000 crore in M&A transactions in Q2 FY26, underpinned by rising demand for high‑acuity care, rapid diagnostics expansion and aggressive capacity additions by leading hospital chains, EY‑Parthenon said in its quarterly sector update. Deal activity remained broad‑based across hospitals, diagnostics and specialty care, comprising buyouts, minority investments and cross‑border acquisitions. Private equity and strategic investors continued to chase scalable regional platforms with strong clinical depth and technology‑enabled models, EY said. Hospitals to add 18,000 Beds High‑end clinical specialties—oncology, cardiology, neurology and gastroenterology—drove a sharp pickup in patient volumes and pricing power across the sector. Average revenue per occupied bed rose 10–16% year‑on‑year among large chains, aided by higher case complexity and tighter pricing discipline. India’s biggest networks are in the middle of their most ambitious expansion cycle yet, with plans to add over 18,000 beds in the next three to five years. Apollo Hospitals, Max, Aster, NH, KIMS and several mid‑market chains reported double‑digit revenue growth, stable to rising occupancy and stronger international patient flows. Digital and home‑care‑led revenues contributed as much as 25–30 percent for some operators. Diagnostics leads growth Diagnostics chains again outperformed, recording 10–22 percent revenue growth. Several players posted EBITDA margins in the 25–35 percent range, benefiting from scale efficiencies and an accelerated shift toward genomics, molecular testing and oncology diagnostics. Preventive and wellness packages contributed up to 26% of quarterly revenue for select chains, reflecting rising out‑of‑pocket spending and deeper penetration into Tier‑3 and Tier‑4 cities. Industry consolidation continued, with integration of recent acquisitions—Core Diagnostics, DAPIC, Scientific Pathology—progressing across networks. Franchise‑led expansion in smaller towns remained a significant growth lever. Specialty hospitals, med‑tech see sustained momentum Single‑specialty chains, including oncology and mother‑and‑child operators, reported steady improvement in occupancy, driven by clinician additions and capacity expansion in fast‑growing clusters. Medical device companies delivered healthy revenue growth backed by capacity commissioning and global acquisitions in cardiology and orthopedics. Investor appetite strong despite valuation premiums Healthcare assets continued to command premium valuations, with listed-company EV/EBITDA multiples ranging from the mid‑teens to above 30x, EY said. Investors increasingly favored integrated platforms and tech‑enabled offerings, while also pushing portfolio companies to expand into Tier‑2 and Tier‑3 markets. “Q2 FY26 reinforces the structural strength of India’s healthcare sector,” said Kaivaan Movdawalla, National Healthcare Leader at EY‑Parthenon. “The clear shift toward high‑acuity care and the rapid rise of advanced diagnostics reflect a sector poised for long‑term, durable growth.” Outlook EY expects momentum to remain firm through FY26, supported by rising consumption, expanding insurance penetration and newly commissioned hospital capacity coming on stream. While margin pressure may persist for new assets, medium‑term fundamentals remain robust, the firm said. “Investor interest is set to remain strong as strategic and financial buyers build long‑term exposure to the sector,” said Amit Gupta, Partner – Healthcare & Life Sciences Investment Banking at EY. “Scalable platforms with strong unit economics and clear expansion pathways will command sustained premiums.” Some important deals in recent times Manipal Hospitals completed a full buyout of Sahyadri Hospitals from OTPP for Rs 5300 crore as part of its ongoing multi‑specialty expansion strategy, while Baby Memorial Hospital acquired a majority stake in Meitra Hospital for Rs 1000-Rs 1200 crore, adding a premium tertiary‑care platform to its portfolio. Fortis Healthcare strengthened its North India cluster with the Rs 470‑crore acquisition of Shrimann Hospitals in Punjab, even as Narayana Hrudayalaya made its first major overseas move with a £183‑million acquisition of Practice Plus Group Hospitals in the UK, marking its entry into that market. Yatharth Hospital also expanded its regional presence through a Rs 260‑crore purchase of a 150‑bed hospital in Agra from the local promoter group, further consolidating its footprint in North India.","Indian healthcare sector delivered one of its strongest quarters in recent years, clocking over Rs 10,000 crore in M&A transactions in Q2 FY26, underpinned by rising demand for high‑acuity care, rapid diagnostics expansion and aggressive capacity additions by leading hospital chains, EY‑Parthenon said in its quarterly sector update.","Indian healthcare sector delivered one of its strongest quarters in recent years, clocking over Rs 10,000 crore in M&A transactions in Q2 FY26, underpinned by rising demand for high‑acuity care, rapid diagnostics expansion and aggressive capacity additions by leading hospital chains, EY‑Parthenon said in its quarterly sector update.","Average revenue per occupied bed rose 10–16% year‑on‑year among large chains, aided by higher case complexity and tighter pricing discipline.","“Scalable platforms with strong unit economics and clear expansion pathways will command sustained premiums.” Some important deals in recent times Manipal Hospitals completed a full buyout of Sahyadri Hospitals from OTPP for Rs 5300 crore as part of its ongoing multi‑specialty expansion strategy, while Baby Memorial Hospital acquired a majority stake in Meitra Hospital for Rs 1000-Rs 1200 crore, adding a premium tertiary‑care platform to its portfolio.",positive,0.934719979763031

Sun Pharma terms $10-billion Organon buy report as 'speculative',https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/sun-pharma-terms-10-billion-organon-buy-report-as-speculative-13779506.html,"Sun Pharma on Monday called the news report about the company evaluating $10-billion acquisition of US drugmaker Organon as ""speculative"". ""The information set out in the article is speculative in nature and there is no material event or information that requires disclosure,"" Sun Pharma said in a statement to stock exchanges. The Economic Times on Monday reported citing people familiar with the matter that Sun Pharma is evaluating a takeover of Organon & Co. in a transaction that could be valued at about $10 billion including debt, a move that would mark the biggest overseas acquisition ever by an Indian drugmaker. The report said the deal would give India’s largest pharmaceutical company by market value a stronger commercial base in the US—its largest market—and expand its presence in women’s health and the fast‑growing biosimilars segment. Organon, spun off from Merck in 2021 with a sizeable debt load, has been divesting assets to streamline its balance sheet and refocus on core biopharma operations. Its market value has more than halved over the past year, prompting renewed buyer interest, the newspaper reported. Sun Pharma has hired a European bank to help structure financing for the potential acquisition, ET said. While discussions have picked up as Organon’s share price weakened, there is no certainty the talks will result in a transaction. The buyer may consider an all‑cash bid or a combination of stock and cash, ET reported, adding that rival interest could still emerge. For Sun, the deal would represent its boldest global move since its purchase of Ranbaxy Laboratories in 2014. The potential acquisition of Organon would allow the drugmaker to significantly expand its US scale in specialty and branded medicines, while also broadening its women’s health footprint—a category where Organon has long‑established leadership. The deal would further strengthen Sun’s position in the consolidated global biosimilars market, giving it access to Organon’s portfolio developed with Samsung Bioepis, and diversify its US operations beyond dermatology and ophthalmology into higher‑margin therapeutic areas. Absorbing Organon could also help Sun accelerate its shift toward higher‑margin branded and specialty products in the US market, where it has launched several innovative therapies over the past few years. Investor anticipation around a potential sale has already driven Organon’s shares up 28% over the past month, reversing part of the steep losses the stock suffered earlier. Organon generated $6.4 billion in revenue in FY24, while its biosimilar portfolio, developed with Samsung Bioepis, contributed around $660 million last year. The US drugmaker inherited $9.5 billion in debt at its 2021 spin‑off and still carried $8.9 billion in borrowings by Q2 2025. It has been actively selling assets to cut leverage. It recently sold its postpartum hemorrhage device to Laborie Medical—to pivot more aggressively toward women’s health biopharma and biosimilars.","The potential acquisition of Organon would allow the drugmaker to significantly expand its US scale in specialty and branded medicines, while also broadening its women’s health footprint—a category where Organon has long‑established leadership.","The Economic Times on Monday reported citing people familiar with the matter that Sun Pharma is evaluating a takeover of Organon & Co. in a transaction that could be valued at about $10 billion including debt, a move that would mark the biggest overseas acquisition ever by an Indian drugmaker.","Organon, spun off from Merck in 2021 with a sizeable debt load, has been divesting assets to streamline its balance sheet and refocus on core biopharma operations.",The report said the deal would give India’s largest pharmaceutical company by market value a stronger commercial base in the US—its largest market—and expand its presence in women’s health and the fast‑growing biosimilars segment.,positive,0.9334344267845154

Outlook for January 20 Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities Today, the benchmark indices corrected sharply. The Nifty ends 109 points lower, while the Sensex was down by 324 points. Among sectors, the Reality Index lost the most, shed over 2 percent, whereas despite weak market sentiment, some buying interest was seen in selective FMCG stocks. Technically, after an early morning intraday selloff, the market took support near 25,500/82900 and trimmed some losses. However, the short-term market texture remains weak. On daily charts, it has formed a bearish candle, and on intraday charts, it is holding a weak formation, which is largely negative. We are of the view that the current market texture is weak, but a fresh selloff is possible only if 25,500/82900 is dismissed. Below this level, the market could slip to 25,400-25,350/82600-82500. On the flip side, above 25,650/83500, a pullback move could extend till 25,750-25,800/83800-84000. The intraday market texture is volatile and non-directional; hence, level-based trading would be the ideal strategy for day traders. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty remained under bearish control, with the index sustaining below the 20 EMA throughout the session. Intraday volatility persisted, and every rise was sold into. The RSI continued in a bearish crossover and trended lower as the index closed at a multi-day low. Market fear remained elevated, as reflected by a spike in India VIX. In the near term, the index may continue to drift lower, with a potential downside target around 25,200, while resistance is placed near 25,700.

Yes Bank stock was trading at Rs 22.78 in the afternoon session, down 2.9 percent, even as the private sector lender posted a 55 percent year-on-year rise in standalone net profit for Q3 FY26, aided by a sharp reduction in provisions. Over the past one year, Yes Bank shares are still up over 20 percent, outperforming the benchmark Nifty 50’s roughly 10 percent gain. Profit jump fails to reassure Street Yes Bank’s Q3 profit growth was driven largely by a steep 91 percent year-on-year fall in provisions, helping lift return on assets to around 0.9 percent. However, several brokerages said that the improvement was not backed by a meaningful acceleration in core growth or sustainable returns. Anand Rathi said retail stress remains visible and return on equity continues to be sub-par, adding that the profit uptick was largely a function of lower provisioning rather than a structural improvement in earnings quality. Emkay Global maintained its ‘Sell’ rating with a target price of Rs 20, citing anemic credit growth of around 5 percent year-on-year, dragged by the retail segment. The brokerage said the bank remains dependent on recoveries from non-performing assets to drive profitability, while growth and return metrics continue to lag peers. Emkay also flagged elevated valuations, noting that the stock trades at about 1.4 times FY27 estimated adjusted book value, which it considers demanding given the weak growth profile and modest return outlook. While management commentary suggests that corporate portfolio consolidation may be largely behind and growth could improve, Emkay said it remains cautious, pointing to the possibility of another round of portfolio clean-up following potential top management changes. Citi adds to caution; analyst ratings show bearishness Citi, which also has a ‘Sell’ stance on the stock, acknowledged the bank’s efforts to reconstruct stressed assets and improve net interest margins. However, the brokerage said it is closely monitoring the Supreme Court hearing related to the AT-1 bonds case, which remains an overhang. According to LSEG data cited by Reuters, the stock is currently rated ‘Sell’ on average by 11 analysts, with a median target price of Rs 18, implying downside from current levels. While brokerages broadly agree that Yes Bank has made progress on asset quality and balance-sheet clean-up since its reconstruction, they remain unconvinced about the sustainability of earnings improvement without a sharper pickup in loan growth and a clearer path to higher returns.

The portfolio, internally referred to as the “next wave of pipeline assets”, stays firmly anchored in antibiotics, an area big pharma has abandoned due to low commercial returns. Wockhardt chose a “white‑space strategy” in anti‑infectives, where global players have pulled back and resistance levels are rising sharply, creating both medical need and market opportunity, Khorakiwala said. “Why would we give up a lead we already have?” he said, adding Wockhardt plans to remain exclusively focused on antibiotics for the next 10–20 years. Wockhardt's antibiotic pipeline is focused heavily on multi-drug resistant (MDR) infections, with novel agents such as Zaynich (Zidebactam/Cefepime) currently seeking USFDA approval. WCK 6777 (Odrate), a once-daily outpatient treatment for complex infections such as those of the urinary tract and intra-abdominal, has received USFDA Fast Track designation. The company also has early-stage candidates such as WCK 771 and WCK 2349, and the recently launched Indian respiratory antibiotic Miqnaf (Nafithromycin), all targeting critical unmet needs for severe bacterial infections. The company also has WCK 4282, branded as Foviscu, undergoing clinical trials. Zaynich’s review status Khorakiwala said Zaynich’s new drug application (NDA) is under a six–to eight–month Fast Track USFDA review, with expected approval by mid‑2026, and he is “very confident of a positive outcome” for the drug aimed at life-threatening multi-drug resistant “superbugs”. Khorakiwala said the company is evaluating various strategies to take its pipeline global: building its own commercial footprint in markets such as the US for injectable hospital antibiotics, and selectively pursuing partnerships or licensing deals if the economics justify it. Wockhardt has appointed a merchant banker and is holding discussions with potential partners, though Khorakiwala insists the company will commercialise products independently if valuations do not reflect the scientific value created. Developing a commercial organisation is “far easier” than building a research engine, particularly since the company’s new drugs are aimed at tertiary-care, high-end hospitals that require focused sales teams of “50–100 people” in the US market, Khorakiwala said. He also positioned Wockhardt’s antibiotic research as a strategic national asset, saying India could become a global leader if the government directs funding and regulatory reforms toward organisations with demonstrated innovation capability. The company has called for streamlining Phase 3 approvals, which take nearly two years in India compared to five to six months in the US and Europe.","""So, we will have every two years, three years, a new drug coming out for the next 10 to 15 years.","Zaynich’s review status Khorakiwala said Zaynich’s new drug application (NDA) is under a six–to eight–month Fast Track USFDA review, with expected approval by mid‑2026, and he is “very confident of a positive outcome” for the drug aimed at life-threatening multi-drug resistant “superbugs”.","WCK 6777 (Odrate), a once-daily outpatient treatment for complex infections such as those of the urinary tract and intra-abdominal, has received USFDA Fast Track designation.","Drugmaker Wockhardt expects the next decade to be a defining phase for its innovation strategy, with the company preparing to roll out a steady stream of novel antibiotics to tackle drug resistance, a growing are of concern among doctors and patients alike.",positive,0.8175889253616333

Wipro shares crash 7% as weak Q3 guidance outweighs steady operations; brokerages split on stock outlook,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/wipro-shares-crash-7-as-weak-q3-guidance-outweighs-steady-operations-brokerages-split-on-stock-outlook-13778256.html,"Wipro Ltd shares tumbled nearly 7 percent in Monday’s morning trade to around Rs 249, extending their recent underperformance, as investors reacted to weaker-than-expected near-term guidance issued alongside the company’s Q3 results late Friday. The selloff reflects investor concerns despite relatively steady operational performance in the fiscal third quarter. Today's fall adds to Wipro’s weak longer-term showing. The stock is down about 17.3 percent over the past year, sharply lagging the Nifty 50’s roughly 10 percent gain over the same period. For the quarter ended December 31, 2025, Wipro reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 3,119 crore, down 4 percent quarter-on-quarter and 7 percent year-on-year. IT services revenue stood at Rs 23,378 crore, missing Street estimates but rising 3.3 percent sequentially. Operating performance was mixed, with the company highlighting margin discipline and strong cash generation. However, at the heart of investor concern seems to be Wipro’s guidance for the March quarter, which came in below Street expectations, even as the company reported sequential revenue growth and maintained margins. Wipro guided for IT services revenue of $2.635 billion to $2.688 billion for the March quarter. This implies sequential growth of 0 percent to 2 percent in constant currency terms. Post-results brokerage commentary points to a clear divide. While some analysts see value support and operational discipline, others argue that weak deal momentum and execution risks justify caution -- views that appear to be driving Monday’s sell-off. Nomura: Buy, but flags guidance disappointment Nomura reiterated a Buy rating on Wipro with a target price of Rs 290 per share, arguing that Q3 operational performance was ahead of expectations. The brokerage acknowledged that Q4 guidance was weaker than anticipated, but noted that deal wins remained steady and margin discipline was intact. While Nomura cut its EPS estimates for FY27–FY28, it believes valuation comfort and dividend yield provide downside support to the stock. Jefferies: Underperform on growth and margin risks Jefferies struck a more cautious tone, maintaining an Underperform rating with a target price of Rs 220 per share. The brokerage said Q3 adjusted results were largely in line with expectations, but flagged weak deal bookings and delays in ramping new contracts as key risks to growth guidance. Jefferies also warned that margins could come under pressure from deal ramp-ups and acquisitions, and said low EPS CAGR and limited dividend appeal make the stock’s risk-reward unattractive.

The stock fell to Rs 1,367 on NSE, down 3.1 percent from the previous close. Brokerages largely retained their positive stance on ICICI Bank stock after the lender’s fiscal third quarter results, looking past a profit miss driven by one-off provisions, while pointing to steady operating trends, stable margins and an improving deposit trajectory. The extension of CEO Sandeep Bakhshi’s tenure also emerged as a key positive, removing a lingering overhang on the stock. ICICI Bank reported a 4 percent year-on-year decline in standalone net profit to Rs 11,318 crore in Q3 FY26, as higher one-off provisions weighed on earnings. Net interest income rose 7.7 percent year-on-year, supported by stable margins of 4.3 percent, while loan growth remained healthy, led by the corporate segment. Asset quality improved during the quarter, with the gross NPA ratio easing to 1.53 percent, though elevated provisions tempered overall profitability. Ahead of the quarterly results, ICICI Bank share price fell 0.4 percent on Friday to end at Rs 1,413 on NSE. The stock has gained over 15 percent in the last one year, outperforming benchmark Nifty 50, which has returned less than 11 percent during the same period. ICICI Bank stock call: Brokerages bullish on growth Brokerages also pointed to loan growth led by the corporate and mortgage segments, improving deposit traction with a stable CASA ratio. CLSA reiterated its Outperform rating on ICICI Bank with a target price of Rs 1,700 per share, implying an upside of over 20 percent. CLSA said the Q3 profit before tax missed estimates by about 7 percent due to a one-time provision. Excluding this impact, the brokerage said the bank’s adjusted performance was largely in line with expectations. CLSA highlighted 4 percent quarter-on-quarter and 12 percent year-on-year loan growth, led by the corporate segment, while noting that margins remained stable at 4.3 percent. Deposit growth improved to 9 percent year-on-year, with the CASA ratio holding steady, and asset quality trends remained strong with improved slippage ratios. Also read | HDFC Bank stock outlook: Brokerages bullish after Q3 profit beat Jefferies maintained its Buy rating and raised its target price to Rs 1,730 per share, attributing the Q3 earnings miss to higher agricultural provisions and the impact of labour law-related costs. The brokerage said loan growth improved to 12 percent, driven by corporate and mortgage loans, while unsecured retail lending remained soft. Asset quality stayed stable, Jefferies said, adding that the two-year extension granted to CEO Sandeep Bakhshi until October 2028 provides continuity and clarity at the top. Bernstein, which has a more cautious stance, retained its Market Perform rating with a target price of Rs 1,550 per share. The brokerage acknowledged that the CEO’s re-appointment meaningfully reduces an overhang on the stock; but it flagged a weaker quarterly performance. Bernstein said loan and deposit growth trailed broader system trends, margins were flat quarter-on-quarter compared with improvements seen at peers, and a one-time spike in credit costs hurt profitability. It also noted that earnings per share declined on a year-on-year basis. Kotak Institutional Equities reiterated its Add rating and raised its target price to Rs 1,800 per share, noting that Q3 FY26 earnings declined around 4 percent year-on-year due to higher one-off provisions. Kotak said the extension of the CEO’s tenure until October 2028 removes uncertainty, while loan growth of about 10 percent year-on-year and deposit growth of around 8 percent year-on-year point to steady underlying momentum.

The brokerage noted that the bank’s Q3 FY26 profit before tax was 5 percent ahead of estimates, aided by in-line pre-provision operating profit and lower-than-expected credit costs. Core operating profit came in 2 percent above expectations, driven by better net interest margins and cost control. CLSA highlighted an 8 basis point sequential expansion in margins, supported by lower deposit costs and the benefit of the CRR cut, even as loan growth at 2.7 percent quarter-on-quarter lagged its estimate.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade UPL, IDBI Bank, Mishra Dhatu Nigam, Tech Mahindra, HCL Technologies, and others on January 19?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-upl-idbi-bank-mishra-dhatu-nigam-tech-mahindra-hcl-technologies-and-others-on-january-19-13777775.html,"The benchmark indices saw pressure at higher levels in the later part of the session and closed flat with a positive bias on January 16, with weak market breadth. A total of 1,675 shares declined against 1,233 advancing shares on the NSE. Consolidation with rangebound trading may continue for a few more sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities Punjab National Bank | CMP: Rs 132.36 On the weekly chart, Punjab National Bank is trending higher, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms, indicating bullish sentiment. It has also surpassed the multiple resistance zone of Rs 126 levels on a closing basis, along with huge volumes, indicating increased participation. The stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMA, which reconfirms the bullish trend. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength RSI is in positive territory, which signals rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 142, Rs 155 Stop-Loss: Rs 128 JK Cement | CMP: Rs 5,885 With a weekly closing, JK Cement has confirmed a past 6–7 weeks’ down-sloping trendline breakout at Rs 5,750 levels on a closing basis, indicating a short-term trend reversal. A bullish crossover of the 20- and 50-day SMAs reconfirms the short-term bullish trend. The daily and weekly strength RSI is in positive territory, which signals rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,200, Rs 6,450 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,650 UPL | CMP: Rs 790.15 For the past couple of years, UPL has been trending higher, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms, indicating a sustained uptrend. With the current close, the stock is approaching the “multiple resistance zone” breakout of Rs 820–830 levels. Any sustainable move above the same may trigger fresh upside momentum toward Rs 900–950 levels. The stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMA, and these averages are also inching up along with rising prices, which reconfirms a bullish trend. The daily and monthly strength RSI is in positive territory, which signals rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 830, Rs 900 Stop-Loss: Rs 760 Osho Krishan, Chief Manager - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One IDBI Bank | CMP: Rs 104.55 IDBI Bank has experienced profit booking post the breakout over a multi-week resistance and has retested the neckline in the previous week. The technical structure remains robust, with the cycle of higher highs intact in the counter and the stock comfortably placed near the 20 DEMA. Additionally, the SuperTrend parameter indicates a bullish outlook, and the recent correction provides an opportunity to reiterate bullish positions from a short- to medium-term perspective. Hence, we recommend buying the stock around Rs 102–100. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 118, Rs 122 Stop-Loss: Rs 92 Inox Green Energy Services | CMP: Rs 189.38 Inox Green Energy has undergone a corrective phase of nearly 30 percent from its lifetime high post the formation of an ‘Inverted H&S’ on daily charts, and with the recent plunge, the counter has retested the neckline. Simultaneously, there has been a ‘bullish divergence’ between the RSI and price action, that too at the neckline and the 200 DSMA, suggesting the initiation of a counter-trend in the stock price in the near period. Hence, we recommend buying the stock around Rs 185–180. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 220, Rs 240 Stop-Loss: Rs 160 Mishra Dhatu Nigam | CMP: Rs 357.85 Mishra Dhatu Nigam has demonstrated substantial consolidation near its significant EMAs in the last couple of weeks. Additionally, the counter is in a ‘symmetrical triangle’ formation on the broader timeframe and witnessed a volume spurt near the lower band, which has pushed the counter to a higher zone in the recent period. Also, the technical indicators are strongly aligned with the price momentum, indicating a bullish outlook for the near term. Hence, we recommend buying the stock around Rs 350. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 385, Rs 400 Stop-Loss: Rs 320 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments Tech Mahindra | CMP: Rs 1,670.5 Backed by strong earnings, Tech Mahindra has broken out of a 46-week bullish VCP (volatility contraction pattern) structure near Rs 1,633, signaling a clear shift in trend strength. The stock closed right at the key resistance of Rs 1,684, highlighting this level as the immediate trigger zone. Volume expansion through the base and breakout confirms institutional participation, while rising daily and weekly moving averages underline improving momentum alignment. A sustained move above Rs 1,684 would unlock a sharper upmove toward the prior all-time high of Rs 1,756.85, which now looks more like a minor pause than a ceiling. Beyond that, the broader VCP pattern projects an extended upside toward the Rs 1,900 zone. Risk–reward remains favourable as long as the price holds above the breakout base, with pullbacks likely to be shallow and absorbed. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,900 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,600 HCL Technologies | CMP: Rs 1,698 HCL Technologies has confirmed a decisive breakout from a 29-week bullish cup-and-handle pattern near Rs 1,695, marking a clear trend acceleration. The standout feature is the right side of the pattern forming a tight flag, adding momentum fuel for bulls. The handle also represented the first controlled pullback into rising 10-, 20-, and 50-week moving averages, which are now acting as a strong launchpad. Breakout volumes have expanded sharply, signaling institutional participation and conviction. The price structure across timeframes remains constructive, with risk–reward favourably skewed higher. As long as the stock holds above the breakout zone, follow-through momentum can drive an initial move toward the Rs 1,825–1,938 band. Failure to sustain above the moving average cluster would be the key invalidation. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,825, Rs 1,938 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,640 Force Motors | CMP: Rs 20,565 Force Motors has delivered a clean breakout from a 20-week rectangle formation near Rs 20,500, signaling a resumption of its primary uptrend. The consolidation was constructive, with the price resting firmly on rising 10-, 20-, and 50-week moving averages, which have now aligned to form a strong launchpad. The breakout structure reflects absorption rather than distribution, keeping trend strength intact across timeframes. Volume behaviour remains supportive, indicating steady participation rather than speculative excess. As long as the stock sustains above the breakout zone, momentum is likely to extend further. The immediate upside projection points toward the Rs 22,500 zone, where partial resistance may emerge. Risk–reward remains favourable while the price holds above the rectangle base, with any pullback toward rising averages expected to attract demand rather than trigger supply. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 22,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 19,500","Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,200, Rs 6,450 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,650 UPL | CMP: Rs 790.15 For the past couple of years, UPL has been trending higher, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms, indicating a sustained uptrend.","Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 142, Rs 155 Stop-Loss: Rs 128 JK Cement | CMP: Rs 5,885 With a weekly closing, JK Cement has confirmed a past 6–7 weeks’ down-sloping trendline breakout at Rs 5,750 levels on a closing basis, indicating a short-term trend reversal.","It has also surpassed the multiple resistance zone of Rs 126 levels on a closing basis, along with huge volumes, indicating increased participation.","Simultaneously, there has been a ‘bullish divergence’ between the RSI and price action, that too at the neckline and the 200 DSMA, suggesting the initiation of a counter-trend in the stock price in the near period.",positive,0.36679092049598694
Broader indices underperform but these 27 small-cap stocks gain up to 62%,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/broader-indices-underperform-but-these-27-small-cap-stocks-gain-up-to-62-13776730.html,"Broader indices lagged the benchmarks during the week, with mid- and small-cap indices extending losses for a second straight week, declining up to 0.4 percent. For the week, BSE Sensex index fell 5.89 points at 83570.35, while Nifty50 index rose 11.05 points or 0.04 percent at 25694.35. Sectorally, Nifty Consumer Durables, Realty, Pharma, Healthcare shed 2 percent each, Nifty Auto index slipped 1.75 percent and Nifty Media index down 1 percent during the week. On the other hand, Nifty PSU Bank, Metal added 4.5% each and Nifty IT index rose 2.8%. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) extended their selling in this week also as they offloaded equities worth Rs 14,265.58 crore. In contrast, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) provided support to the market, purchasing equities worth RS 16,173.69 crore. ""The Indian equity markets experienced a range-bound trading week, with the benchmark index oscillating within the confines of its 50 and 100-day EMAs. Despite heightened intraday volatility and sharp swings in both directions, the Nifty50 concluded the truncated week on a subdued note, settling a tad below the 25700 mark and registering a marginal weekly gain of 0.04%,"" said Osho Krishan, Chief Manager -Technical and Derivative research at Angel One. ""The shortened trading week was eventful, influenced by a mix of global and domestic developments. Persistent concerns around trade tariffs and escalating geopolitical tensions continued to weigh on investor sentiment, fostering a cautious market environment. At the same time, ongoing quarterly earnings announcements and key macroeconomic data provided selective opportunities across sectors. Despite these headwinds, the market exhibited notable resilience. The Nifty50 index managed to contain downside risks, holding near the key EMA on the daily charts, underscoring the underlying strength and consolidation phase in the broader market structure."" ""Going forward, it remains crucial to closely monitor global developments, particularly those related to trade tariffs and geopolitical tensions, as these factors are likely to act as significant catalysts in shaping near-term market trends. Additionally, several heavyweight constituents of the Nifty are scheduled to announce their earnings over the weekend, the impact of which is expected to be reflected in market action in the forthcoming sessions. In this backdrop, a prudent and disciplined approach is recommended, with market participants aligning their strategies around the aforementioned technical levels,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index declined nearly 0.5 percent during the week. Stocks such as Genesys International Corporation, Nectar Lifesciences, GTPL Hathway, Universal Cables, Tejas Networks, InfoBeans Technologies, Lotus Chocolate Company, United Foodbrands, Amal, Igarashi Motors, Cohance Lifesciences, Globus Spirits and Jindal Poly Films fell between 10–18 percent. Meanwhile, Wardwizard Innovations and Mobility, JTL Industries, Antelopus Selan Energy, IFCI, Baazar Style Retail, Angel One, Dredging Corporation India, 3B BlackBio Dx, Neogen Chemicals and Antony Waste Handling Cell gained between 15–62 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Nifty on the weekly chart formed a small bull candle with upper and lower shadow. Technically, this market action signal formation of high wave type candle pattern after a sharp weakness of previous week. This reflects ongoing volatility in the market. The underlying trend of Nifty remains choppy. A sustainable move above 25900 could open further upside for the next week. However, a slide below the support of 25500 could trigger more downside in the market ahead. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking The ongoing tussle around the medium-term moving average, the 100 DEMA near the 25,600 zone, is keeping participants cautious. The market is likely to take cues from the earnings announcements of key heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank in early trade on Monday, which could determine the next directional move. Until then, participants are advised to maintain a selective, stock-specific approach, focusing on sectors showing relative strength such as IT, financials and metals, while adhering to disciplined risk management in the prevailing volatile environment. Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research, Kotak Securities We are of the view that the current market formation is volatile and non-directional, and the short-term activity indicating a non-directional trend is likely to continue in the near future. On the downside, 25,500/83000 and 25,400/82700 would act as key support zones, while the daily SMA (Simple Moving Average) at 25,950/84600 and the 20-day SMA at 26,000/84800 would be crucial resistance levels for the bulls. For Bank Nifty, as long as it is trading above the 20-day SMA at 59,500, the uptrend is likely to continue. On the higher side, it could move up to 60,500. Further upside potential may lift the index up to 60,800. Conversely, if it falls below the 20-day SMA at 59,500, the uptrend would become vulnerable.

Wall Street ends little changed before long weekend,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/wall-street-ends-little-changed-before-long-weekend-13776717.html,"US stocks ended nearly flat on Friday in a choppy session ahead of the long weekend, and all three major indexes ​posted losses for the week as fourth-quarter earnings season kicked off. Healthcare fell 0.8% and led declines for the day among S&P ‌500 sectors. Shares of chipmakers rose, with an index of semiconductors gaining 1.2% and extending gains from Thursday. Big U.S. banks posted mostly solid results this week as the S&P 500 reporting period got under way. Still, shares of banks and other financial institutions have been pressured by worries over U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed one-year cap on credit card interest rates at 10%. The S&P 500 financial sector ended up 0.1% on Friday but posted its biggest weekly percentage decline since October. Investors also ‌digested news that Trump said he may want to keep economic adviser Kevin Hassett in his current role, lowering ​market bets that Hassett would succeed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. ""To finish the week around flat with the S&P 500 still within spitting distance of 7,000 - most investors will take that as a win two weeks into the year,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. ""One of ‍the other reasons markets have been flat-lining is we're at the start of the earnings season,"" he said. ""Bank earnings are showing a generally favorable economic and business backdrop. Now we're going to start seeing other companies tied to other sectors, and that's going to give us a better take on fundamental conditions.""

For the week, the S&P 500 was down 0.38%, the Nasdaq declined 0.66% and the Dow fell 0.29%. The earnings season ramps up next week with reports from heavyweights ‌including Netflix, ‌Johnson & Johnson and Intel. Investors were also cautious of making big bets ahead of the long weekend, with the stock market shut on Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. While stocks have largely traded in a relatively tight range in recent sessions, some options market participants expect more choppy price action in coming days following Friday's monthly options expiration. ""Historically the middle part of January tends to be pretty choppy,"" said Bruce Zaro, managing director at Granite Wealth ⁠Management in Plymouth, Massachusetts. ""Once we work our ⁠way through that, then we ​are likely to see a little bit better performance out to the end of the month. Hopefully, we'll find the month positive,"" which could suggest positive performance for the year, Zaro said.

Can IT sector see market re-rating amid positive AI commentary by Infosys after TCS? Analysts say 'evidence of monetisation' needed,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/can-it-sector-see-market-re-rating-amid-positive-ai-commentary-by-infosys-after-tcs-analysts-say-evidence-of-monetisation-needed-13776099.html,"IT stocks saw significant surge on December 16, buoyed by the positive October-December quarter results and management commentary on artificial intelligence (AI) progress by heavyweight Infosys. Analysts have commented on whether the sharp rebound in IT stocks can lead to a market re-rating and take them to fresh highs. Infosys shares closed around 6 percent higher, leading gains on the Nifty IT index which rose more than 3 percent to a three-week high of 39,086.65. Notably, the IT index was the worst performing sector in 2025, falling around 15 percent during the year overall. Infosys Q3 Results: Infosys reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 6,654 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 2.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall from the Rs 6,806 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. This however included Rs 1,289-crore one-time cost on account of new labour codes. The IT major’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose 9 percent YoY to Rs 45,479 crore. The company revised its fiscal ending 2026 revenue growth forecast upwards to 3-3.5 percent, from an earlier estimate of 2-3 percent. AI commentary: Infosys said it now has over 500 AI agents and is doing AI work with more than 90 percent of its top 200 clients, as it pitches itself as an ""AI partner of choice"" for large enterprises. ""They are using agents in several of our service lines to help enhance either growth or productivity,"" CEO and managing director Salil Parekh said during the company's post-earnings press conference on January 14. Infosys is well placed to benefit from enterprise-wide AI spending, given its discretionary heavy mix, said Motilal Oswal Financial Services, which retained its 'Buy' call on the stock. At the current valuations, upside risks meaningfully outweigh downside risks, it added, while keeping a target price of Rs 2,200 per share for the stock, which implies a 37 percent upside potential from the previous closing price. Infosys's push for vendor consolidation is boosting growth prospects, while its AI library is strengthening its position as clients expand account sizes during renewals, Morningstar said.""Infosys is in a better competitive position compared with other Indian IT consulting firms due to its comprehensive AI offerings,"" the brokerage added. Infosys, which won AI-led deals with Adobe and Siemens AG in 2025, did not disclose revenue from AI projects. Last month, Accenture beat first-quarter revenue estimates on strong demand for AI-driven IT services. Tata Consultancy Services' annualised AI revenue jumped 17.3 percent sequentially to $1.8 billion, outpacing its December quarter growth of 1.96 percent. ""The growth momentum we witnessed in Q2 FY26 continued in Q3 FY26. We remain steadfast in our ambition to become the world’s largest AI-led technology services company, guided by a comprehensive five-pillar strategy,"" CEO and managing director K Krithivasan said. HCLTech said its AI revenue came in at $146 million, up from $100 million in the previous quarter. Revenue from the company's banking and technology verticals rose by 8.1 percent and 14.4 percent respectively, while that from life sciences fell 2 percent during the quarter. Earlier this week, Motilal Oswal said it expects AI-related deal conversion to begin to show up in revenue in H2 FY27. This is also when AI-linked productivity deflation begins to be offset by new AI services work. The firm sees large-cap revenue growth rates starting to improve toward the 6-7 percent range, and AI services moving into the full deployment mode by FY28. Industry revenue growth rates materially will likely accelerate to 8-9 percent (as against today's 3–4 percent) as AI modernisation, data workloads, and enterprise integration scale up, the domestic brokerage said, adding that this supports a sector-wide rerating as growth visibility improves. HDFC Securities meanwhile said that AI will remain a dominant factor shaping economic and market conditions going forward, and AI-led recovery will likely accelerate in H2 2026 after a muted H1 for the Indian IT sector. According to a new research survey by Capgemini Research, after an era of 'AI hype', business leaders are now increasingly realistic and pragmatic about their AI strategies, and have started using it in their decision-making. Can IT rebound lead to markets re-rating? IT stocks carry a significant share in benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty, and are closely tracked by investors globally. Strong earnings from Infosys could act as a short-term sentiment booster for the broader market as a positive earnings outcome and a better outlook help signal that demand conditions in key overseas markets may be stabilising, which supports overall risk appetite, said Ravi Singh, Chief Research Officer at Master Capital Services. As confidence builds, this could lead to short-term momentum not only in IT but also in other industries, the analyst said. However, for this to result in long-term market strength, comparable earnings traction must also be seen in other heavyweight sectors, according to Singh. ""If not, the effects of optimism driven by IT are probably going to be more tactical than systemic,"" he added. ""Although the long-term growth is reinforced by companies like Infosys and TCS's increased focus on AI, it is unlikely to lead to a broad-based valuation re-rating in a short time. Before allocating higher multiples, markets typically wait for stronger evidence of profit, margin growth and steady earnings contribution from AI-led deals,"" Singh said. 'Markets need to see consistent performance in AI space': For a rerating, markets need to see consistent quarter performance in the AI space, including tangible deals and acquisitions, said Shravan Shetty, Managing Director at Primus Partners, who added that the earnings commentary and forward guidance would need to point towards this. Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research - Investment Services at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, however noted that with Infosys results, there has been a visible shift in the sentiments in the IT space and markets are expecting similar momentum from other companies. ""IT sector has decent weights in frontline indices and definitely may lead the indices in near term. However, scaling towards fresh highs alone on back if IT sector is possible but difficult at this juncture and need participation from other heavy weights as well,"" he added. Will strong results trigger re-rating for IT stocks? Speaking on whether the strong results will drive a re-rating for IT stocks, Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS, said that AI commentary is directionally constructive, but a full rerating needs evidence of monetisation, not just intent. ""In the near term, AI is more likely to drive a ‘selective rerating’ within IT rather than a blanket multiple expansion. Companies with higher exposure to short-cycle, ROI-led AI work and strong platform partnerships may see faster earnings revisions, while others may remain range-bound. The rerating trigger for the sector will be consistent: rising AI contribution to deal wins, expanding wallet share in core verticals like BFSI, and confirmation that GenAI is incremental rather than cannibalising legacy work. So yes, AI can change the slope of the cycle—but it is still early, and the market will demand proof through numbers over the next 2–3 quarters,"" Dasani said. Axis Securities remained 'cautiously optimistic' for the Indian IT sector. It noted that Infosys’ sequential growth trajectory suggests a stable environment rather than an improving one.",Will strong results trigger re-rating for IT stocks?,"'Markets need to see consistent performance in AI space': For a rerating, markets need to see consistent quarter performance in the AI space, including tangible deals and acquisitions, said Shravan Shetty, Managing Director at Primus Partners, who added that the earnings commentary and forward guidance would need to point towards this.","""They are using agents in several of our service lines to help enhance either growth or productivity,"" CEO and managing director Salil Parekh said during the company's post-earnings press conference on January 14.","'Markets need to see consistent performance in AI space': For a rerating, markets need to see consistent quarter performance in the AI space, including tangible deals and acquisitions, said Shravan Shetty, Managing Director at Primus Partners, who added that the earnings commentary and forward guidance would need to point towards this.",positive,0.8206713795661926

The Nifty Realty index gained more than 2 percent to hit intraday high of 867.65 on Friday, before paring some gains. The index closed 0.35 percent higher at 853. Top realty gainers: Prestige Estates were the top gainer on the index, rising nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 1,524.10 apiece. This comes after the company announced that it has recorded pre-sales worth Rs 4,183.6 crore during the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026, marking a 30 percent YoY growth. For the April-December period, the company’s pre-sales surged 122 percent YoY to Rs 22,327.3 crore, marking the highest sales ever achieved by the company and surpassing its previous full-year peak sales. The firm also announced the launch of Evergreen at Prestige Raintree Park in Whitefield, Bengaluru. Macrotech Developers (Lodha), Oberoi Realty and Godrej Properties shares followed, rising around 1 percent each. Godrej Properties on January 15 announced that it has emerged as the largest listed residential real estate developer in India in 2025 for the second consecutive year, based on key operating metrics of booking value and cash collections. The firm sold 16,428 homes with a total saleable area of 27.26 million sq. ft. in 2025, supported by 41 successful project launches across India. Its booking value grew 19 percent YoY to Rs 34,171 crore with a CAGR of nearly 44 percent between 2022 and 2025. Bucking the trend, Anant Raj, DLF, Brigade Enterprises and Phoenix Mills shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. Sobha shares however fell more than 1 percent. Are IT layoffs behind the recent downturn? Indian IT sector has seen mass layoffs last year, which have now spilled over to this year. According to analysts, the IT layoffs have impacted housing demand in key areas, thereby impacting the stocks. IT layoffs are likely to be the major reason for the low demand in the luxury segment of urban centers like Bangalore and Hyderabad as they will be discouraging the high-income buyers, said Shashank Gupta, Director, RPS Group. He added that mid-to-premium housing sales, which have already dropped 15 percent year-on-year, will continue to be affected negatively as the professionals will not be willing to upgrade, opting instead to rent amid such job uncertainties. ""The market has whispered to the executives with Nifty Realty down by 20% from the peaks and talking about the disruption posed by the AI, which also indicates that 30% of the IT jobs that are luxury demand would get stifled due to the automation by 2027. The stock corrections that are expected to be around 5-7% are dependent on the RBI rate cuts and policy revamps that could fuel the market by the second quarter of 2026,"" the analyst said. Keshav Mangla, GM Business Development at Forteasia Realty, cited Anarock data to explain that financial tech layoffs of more than 1 lakh since 2024 have already resulted in a 12 percent drop in the demand for Tier-1 cities, thus resulting in developers' difficulties in managing cash flows and having to sell off their inventory.

The selling pressure pulled down the Nifty Defence index by up to 1 percent, snapping its previous session’s gains. Out of the 18 stocks in the index, only four were trading in the green. Market participants attributed the decline to profit taking after a short-term, news-driven reaction. Sunny Agrawal, Head of Fundamental Research at SBI Securities, said ""Defence stocks have corrected due to easing geopolitical concerns; however, this is largely a short-term, news-driven reaction. From a long-term perspective, the ability of defence companies to deliver healthy earnings growth remains intact. I do not believe that any easing of geopolitical tensions will lead to a reduction in India’s defence budget. While there may be a temporary sentimental impact due to improved geopolitical conditions, the long-term growth potential continues to remain very strong. Any dip should be viewed as a buying opportunity in quality defence stocks for long-term investors."" Trump said he had been informed that killings during Iran’s crackdown on protests were easing and that there was no current plan for large-scale executions. He adopted a wait-and-see approach after earlier threatening intervention. Antigovernment protests across Tehran have eased since Monday, when hundreds of thousands of people attended pro-government demonstrations. Iran has also reopened its airspace after a nearly five-hour closure that had disrupted flights across the region amid concerns over possible military action. According to people inside Iran contacted by Reuters on Wednesday and Thursday, protests appeared to have abated since Monday.

This came as concerns around supply risks eased amid lower expectations of a US strike on Iran. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) shares surged nearly 4 percent to trade at Rs 456.50 apiece, snapping a two-session losing streak. Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) shares meanwhile rose over 3 percent to Rs 367.75 apiece, and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) shares gained around 2 percent to Rs 162.15 apiece. Why are oil prices falling? Oil prices have extended losses after US President Donald Trump signaled that he may hold off on attacking Iran for now. He said that he has been assured that Iran would stop killing protesters, reducing the likelihood of an immediate US military response to the demonstrations against the government of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and of disruptions to Iranian production and key shipping lanes. ""Despite the steady drumbeat of geopolitical risks and macro speculation, the underlying balance still points to ample supply ... unless we see a genuine revival in Chinese demand or a meaningful bottleneck in physical barrel flows, oil looks range-bound, with Brent broadly hovering between $57 and $67,” Reuters quoted Phillip Nova senior market analyst Priyanka Sachdeva as saying. Brent crude fell more than 4 cents to $63.72. Analysts however have advised caution, highlighting the volatility still remains high. ""While (Iranian supply) risks have eased somewhat, they remain significant, keeping the market nervous in the short term,"" IG analysts said in a client note, cited by Reuters. How will OMCs perform in Q3? The state-run OMCs are likely to register strong Q3 results on the back of healthy refining margins, according to analysts. In the Oct-December quarter of FY26, average oil prices declined by 6 percent on a sequential basis and 10 percent from the same period last year, while retail prices were unchanged. “Due to elevated product cracks, refining margins will be sharply higher and implied marketing earnings weaker,” Kotak Institutional Equities said in its report.

The Nifty IT index jumped more than 3 percent to 39,099.95, emerging as the top sectoral gainer on the market today. The index which was the worst performing sector in 2025, has now recorded the sharpest gains in three weeks. Infosys Q3 Results: Infosys shares led gains, jumping nearly 6 percent to trade at Rs 1,693 apiece. This comes after Infosys reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 6,654 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 2.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall from the Rs 6,806 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. This however included Rs 1,289-crore one-time cost on account of new labour codes. The IT major’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose 9 percent YoY to Rs 45,479 crore. The company revised its fiscal ending 2026 revenue growth forecast upwards to 3-3.5 percent, from an earlier estimate of 2-3 percent. Other IT gainers today: Oracle Financial Services Software and LTIMindtree shares gained more than 5 percent each. Notably, LTIMindtree said it has been awarded the Insight 2.0 project by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to build an AI-powered programme for the modernisation of India’s national tax analytics platform. The project, which is expected to be completed within seven years, is valued at around Rs 3,000 crore. Tech Mahindra and Mphasis shares gained around 5 percent each, while Wipro shares were up more than 3 percent. Tech Mahindra and Wipro are set to release their results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing FY26 later today. Persistent Systems and Coforge shares gained around 3 percent, while Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCLTech shares rose over 2 percent each. What lies ahead for IT sector? Axis Securities remained ‘cautiously optimistic’ for the Indian IT sector. It noted that Infosys’ sequential growth trajectory suggests a stable environment rather than an improving one. “From a near-term perspective, global uncertainties will keep overall growth muted. However, the company’s core efficiencies, investments, and deal momentum across regions will support the overall business over the next couple of quarters,” the domestic brokerage said. Infosys’ latest print matters because it is less about a one-quarter beat and more about a demand inflection signal, said Harshal Dasani Business Head INVasset PMS. The analyst said that the company raising its guidance and positive management commentary came at time when the market was questioning the durability of the IT cycle. That helped lift the Nifty IT index meaningfully in today’s session and provided a sentiment tailwind to the broader market. “The setup is encouraging because IT valuations had become more reasonable after underperformance, and even modest upgrades can trigger short-covering. However, a sustained index breakout needs earnings breadth beyond IT—financials, consumption, and industrial capex must also deliver. So, Infosys can be a catalyst for confidence, but new highs are ultimately a function of aggregate earnings visibility and global liquidity,” he added. A positive earnings outcome and a better outlook help signal that demand conditions in key overseas markets may be stabilizing, which supports overall risk appetite, said Ravi Singh, Chief Research Officer at Master Capital Services.

The index gained around 1 percent to 60,160.85 in the morning trading hours of Friday. This marks the first time the index has crossed the key psychological mark of 60,000 in five sessions. Federal Bank shares were the top gainers on the index today, jumping around 6 percent to trade at Rs 261.35 apiece. The lender is set to release its results for the October-December quarter of FY26 today. AU Small Finance Bank shares gained more than 3 percent, while Yes Bank, Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Canara Bank shares gained over 2 percent each. State Bank of India (SBI), IndusInd Bank and Bank of Baroda shares were up over 1 percent, while HDFC Bank, IDFC First Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. Bucking the trend, Union Bank of India shares dropped 2 percent, while Axis Bank shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. Technical view on Bank Nifty: Aakash Shah, Technical Research Analyst at Choice Equity Broking said that 59,900–60,000 is now a crucial resistance cluster, adding that a sustained move above this could revive short-term bullishness. Notably, the crucial mark has already been broken by the index, On the downside, the analyst believes that 59,300–59,400 is key support, and a break below may trigger further consolidation. Axis Securities meanwhile said that the trend-deciding level for the day is 59,567. “If Bank Nifty trades above this level, it may rally up to 59810-60039-60282 levels. However, if it trades below 59567 levels, we may witness profit booking in the market, and the index may correct up to 59337-59095-58865 levels,” the brokerage said. Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivatives Research Analyst at SAMCO Securities, had also suggested that 60,000 was the key resistance level, which is a key breakout level. “From a technical perspective, the index continues to witness buying interest on declines, particularly around the psychologically important 59,500 zone. However, the broader price structure remains range-bound. Nifty Bank is currently oscillating within a wide band of 58,800–60,000, and a decisive move beyond either end of this range is likely to determine the next directional trend,” he added.

As a part of the restructuring exercise, 1,563 operating rooms of Lemon Tree will be transferred to Fleur. Consequently, Lemon Tree will emerge as a pure-play asset light entity whereas Fleur will evolve as a hotel ownership platform. Post the re-organization, Lemon Tree will manage a) 39 hotels with 5,556 rooms of Fleur along-with 2 under-construction hotels with 256 rooms, b) 89 operational hotels with 6,011 rooms owned by 3rd party players, and c) existing future pipeline of 127 hotels with 9,414 rooms. We believe the fee income business has a potential to command higher multiple as it will be asset-light, debt free, capital efficient and margin lucrative (flowthrough to EBITDA is 70%+). On the other hand, the asset heavy business will witness a fund infusion up to Rs9.6bn from Warburg Pincus that can act as a growth capital. Outlook We value Lemon Tree (fee income business) at 30x-Sep 27E EBITDA and Fleur (asset-ownership business) at 24x Sep-27E EBITDA to arrive at a SoTP based TP of Rs185. Upgrade to “BUY”.

LTIMindtree stock surged to a high of around Rs 6,290 in late-morning deals, up about 4.3 percent for the day. The rally pushed the stock to its session high and came amid strong volumes in the IT pack. At current levels, LTIMindtree commands a market capitalisation of about Rs 1.86 lakh crore. Even after Friday’s surge, the stock is up just under 5 percent over the past one year. It has underperforming the Nifty 50, which has gained around 11 percent over the same period. In a press release filed with the stock exchanges, the company said it has been awarded the Insight 2.0 project by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to build an AI-powered programme for the modernisation of India’s national tax analytics platform. The mandate is valued at around Rs 3,000 crore and spans seven years, providing long-term revenue visibility. The project will focus on deploying advanced digital architecture and data analytics. Investors appeared to react positively to both the size and duration of the deal, with the order reinforcing LTIMindtree’s credentials in the public sector. The long contract tenor was also seen as supportive for medium-term earnings visibility. Friday’s move in LTIMindtree also played out against a stronger backdrop for IT stocks more broadly. Buying interest picked up across the sector after Infosys stock surged more than 5 percent, its biggest single-day gain in about four months, following its Q3 FY26 results and an upward revision in revenue growth guidance. The improved sentiment triggered both fresh buying and short-covering in several IT names, lending additional support to LTIMindtree’s rally. From a valuation standpoint, LTIMindtree trades at a TTM price-to-earnings multiple of about 38.2, with a dividend yield of roughly 1 percent, metrics that have kept the stock in focus for investors assessing risk-reward after a period of relative underperformance versus the broader market.

The project will be executed on a lump-sum turnkey basis and involves engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning of LNG/ethane and propane double-wall storage tanks at the Dahej petrochemical complex in Gujarat. The scope of work includes a 170,000 cubic metre LNG/ethane storage tank and a 140,000 cubic metre propane storage tank, along with ethane and propane handling and despatch facilities to support the downstream propane dehydrogenation and polypropylene plant. L&T classified the contract as a ‘large’ order, implying a value in the range of Rs 2,500 crore to Rs 5,000 crore. The project forms part of India’s first petrochemical complex integrating cold energy utilisation from an LNG terminal and is aimed at strengthening domestic petrochemical manufacturing capacity. Friday’s order announcement comes after L&T earlier this week sought to reassure investors over reports related to possible cancellation of oil project tenders in Kuwait. The company had clarified that the projects referred to in those media reports were not part of its order book, following which the stock had pared intraday losses. L&T has also remained in focus in recent sessions after announcing another ‘large’ order earlier this week for its heavy civil infrastructure business, involving the construction of India’s largest pumped storage project in Maharashtra.

"Cipla stock crashes over 3% as brokerages cut targets on Lanreotide disruption, FY27 risks",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/cipla-stock-crashes-over-3-as-brokerages-cut-targets-on-lanreotide-disruption-fy27-risks-13775001.html,"Shares of Cipla Ltd fell sharply on Friday and extended recent weakness, after a series of cautious brokerage notes flagged earnings risks from supply disruptions in its key US product Lanreotide and intensifying competition in other generics. Cipla stock dropped 3.48 percent to Rs 1,384.6 in early trade. The stock is now down about 4 percent over the past one year, sharply underperforming the Nifty 50, which has risen over 10 percent during the same period. The decline comes after Cipla disclosed that manufacturing of Lanreotide has been temporarily paused to support USFDA remediation at its European contract manufacturing partner. Lanreotide is among Cipla’s top three products in the US and accounts for about $150 million in annual revenue, with the company holding a 22 percent market share in the product. Morgan Stanley maintained its Underweight stance on the stock and cut its target price to Rs 1,292 per share. The brokerage warned that the phase-out of gRevlimid and supply disruptions in Lanreotide are likely to weigh on performance, particularly in Q4 FY26. It trimmed earnings estimates by 2 percent for FY26 and 1 percent for FY27, cautioning that any prolonged disruption could result in market share loss and downside risk to FY27 and FY28 earnings. Nuvama also turned more cautious, downgrading Cipla to Reduce and lowering its target price to Rs 1,360 per share. Nuvama said the expiry of gRevlimid exclusivity, uncertainty around Lanreotide supplies, and rising competition for Cipla’s proposed generic Advair following a recent approval for Lannett pose an earnings challenge for FY27. The brokerage noted that Cipla’s European contract manufacturer Pharmathen has temporarily paused production for remediation, with manufacturing expected to restart only in the first half of FY27, adding near-term uncertainty. Cipla has said that the Lanreotide manufacturing halt is linked to remediation efforts following a US Food and Drug Administration inspection at Pharmathen’s Rodopi facility in Greece, which resulted in nine observations. The company has indicated that resupply of Lanreotide is expected to resume in the first half of FY27 and that it is closely monitoring supply levels. Not all brokerages are bearish. Nomura believes the potential loss of Lanreotide sales has largely been priced in, noting that the stock is already down about 6.5 percent since the issue first came to light earlier this month. Nomura has maintained a Buy rating with a target price of Rs 1,770. However, the dominant tone around Cipla remains cautious.

"Infosys shares jump over 5% after Q3 results; brokerages upbeat on guidance hike, deal wins",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/infosys-shares-jump-over-4-after-q3-results-brokerages-upbeat-on-guidance-hike-deal-wins-13774937.html,"Shares of Infosys Ltd rallied sharply on Friday, rising over 5 percent, as investors reacted positively to the IT major’s Q3 FY26 results, a raised revenue growth outlook, and upbeat brokerage commentary following a strong rally in its US-listed ADRs. Infosys stock climbed 5.14 percent to a high or Rs 1,682.1 in early trade, marking a firm rebound after the company’s earnings announcement earlier this week. The stock had ended the previous session at Rs 1,608.9 on the NSE. The buying interest comes despite Infosys reporting a 2.2 percent year-on-year decline in consolidated net profit for the fiscal third quarter, which was weighed down by a one-time labour code-related charge. Investors appeared to look past the headline profit miss, focusing instead on steady constant-currency revenue growth, resilient adjusted margins, and robust large-deal momentum. Infosys raised its FY26 revenue growth guidance to 3-3.5 percent in constant currency terms, citing improving demand visibility and strong execution, while maintaining its operating margin outlook. Large deal wins stood at $4.8 billion during the quarter, including two mega deals, supporting medium-term revenue visibility. Sentiment was also supported by a sharp rally in Infosys’ American Depository Receipts, which jumped about 8 percent over two US trading sessions following the results, signalling a positive offshore investor response. Brokerages reiterated bullish views on the stock after the earnings announcement. CLSA maintained an ‘Outperform’ rating on Infosys with a target price of Rs 1,779 per share, while HSBC reiterated its ‘Buy’ call with a higher target price of Rs 1,870 per share, citing improving demand commentary, greater clarity on AI-led spending, and stabilising US corporate sentiment. Despite Friday’s sharp rebound, Infosys shares remain down about 13 percent over the past one year, underperforming the Nifty 50, which has risen more than 10 percent over the same period. Brokerages say that this has kept the stock firmly on investors' radar for a potential re-rating.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Hindustan Zinc, Punjab National Bank, Tata Steel, MCX India, Laurus Labs, and others on January 16?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-hindustan-zinc-punjab-national-bank-tata-steel-mcx-inida-laurus-labs-and-others-on-january-16-13774581.html,"Equity benchmarks recorded a one-third percent loss, continuing the downtrend for the second consecutive session on January 14, with moderately weakening market breadth. A total of 1,498 shares saw selling pressure compared to 1,385 shares that gained on the NSE. The market may remain range-bound until it decisively breaks the current week’s high–low range. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Nilesh Jain, Head – Technical and Derivatives Research Analyst (Equity Research) at Centrum Broking Hindustan Zinc | CMP: Rs 654.2 Hindustan Zinc continues to remain in a strong uptrend, consistently forming higher tops and higher bottoms. It is trading well above both short-term and long-term moving averages, indicating sustained strength. After witnessing consolidation over the past couple of weeks, the stock has now delivered a fresh breakout, which is supported by higher-than-average volumes, reinforcing the bullish outlook. From a derivatives perspective, the addition of fresh long positions further strengthens the positive bias. Considering the overall technical setup, the stock appears well-positioned to move towards the Rs 700 level in the near term, while crucial support is placed at Rs 621. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 700 Stop-Loss: Rs 621 Punjab National Bank | CMP: Rs 128.68 Punjab National Bank gave a fresh breakout from an ascending triangle pattern on the daily chart. It surpassed double-top resistance and ended at 52-week highs. The sharp price up-move is backed by significantly higher volumes, which validates the bullish setup. Momentum indicators are also supportive, with the RSI moving above the 65 mark and the MACD generating a bullish crossover, indicating improving upward momentum. Overall, the technical structure suggests the stock is well placed to move towards the Rs 140 level in the near term, while immediate support is seen near Rs 123. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 140 Stop-Loss: Rs 123 Polycab India | CMP: Rs 7,323.5 Polycab India earlier formed a double-top pattern and has since been making lower highs and lower lows, indicating a weakening price structure. It has also slipped below all its key short-term moving averages, reinforcing the bearish bias. Currently, the stock is on the verge of breaking down from its rising trendline, with immediate support placed near Rs 7,250. A decisive breach below this level could accelerate selling pressure and drag the stock towards the Rs 6,800 zone. The bearish outlook would be invalidated only if the stock manages to sustain a move above Rs 7,560 on the upside. From a derivatives perspective, the presence of fresh short build-up further supports the negative view. Considering the overall technical setup, the stock appears poised for a breakdown and is likely to drift towards the Rs 6,800 level in the near term. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 6,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 7,560 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities Tata Steel | CMP: Rs 189.25 The Nifty Metal index has been outperforming the frontline indices for the past few sessions, driven by strong buying interest in metal stocks. Tata Steel has delivered a significant technical breakout, forming a Cup and Handle pattern on the daily chart, which is considered a bullish continuation signal. This breakout is validated by robust volumes, adding conviction to the move. Currently, the stock is trading at an all-time high, and all major moving averages are positively aligned, reinforcing the bullish trend. Momentum indicators are also supportive, with the daily and weekly RSI firmly positioned in the super-bullish zone. The MACD remains above its zero line and signal line, while the histogram indicates strengthening upside momentum. Based on these technical factors, the stock is expected to maintain its upward trajectory. Accumulation is advised in the Rs 190–188 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 205 Stop-Loss: Rs 182 Bank of India | CMP: Rs 152.87 The Nifty PSU Bank index has shown remarkable strength, taking support near its 20-day EMA before staging a sharp rally. On Wednesday, the index marked a fresh all-time high, significantly outperforming the benchmark indices. Bank of India mirrored this strength, finding support in the Rs 143–142 zone, which coincides with the 34-day EMA and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of its prior rally. This confluence acted as a strong base, triggering a sharp rebound accompanied by higher volumes. The stock now trades above all key moving averages, and the daily RSI is firmly in the bullish zone, signalling strong momentum. These technical factors suggest continued upside potential. Accumulation is recommended in the Rs 153–151 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 163 Stop-Loss: Rs 147 Multi Commodity Exchange of India | CMP: Rs 2,417 MCX has been a consistent outperformer over the past few months, maintaining a clear uptrend characterized by a series of higher highs and higher lows. Technical indicators confirm strong trend strength, with the Average Directional Index (ADX) reading at 36.79 on the daily chart and 39.43 on the weekly chart, well above the 25 threshold, which signals a robust trend. The Directional Movement Index also supports the bullish outlook, while price action remains firmly above all key moving averages. These factors indicate that the stock is in a powerful uptrend with strong momentum. Accumulation is suggested in the Rs 2,420–2,400 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,590 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,330 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Laurus Labs | CMP: Rs 1,090.5 Laurus Labs has moved up over the last two trading sessions following the formation of a tweezers bottom reversal pattern on the daily timeframe. Additionally, the higher-top higher-bottom structure appears to be intact. The RSI is in a bullish crossover and is trending higher. The stock is likely to continue its recovery in the coming days. A stop-loss can be placed below Rs 1,060, while a long position may be considered with potential upside towards Rs 1,160. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,160 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,060 KEI Industries | CMP: Rs 4,384.6 Following a correction, KEI Industries has formed a bullish engulfing pattern on the daily chart, indicating a potential bullish reversal in price. Additionally, the stock has moved above the 20 EMA. Sentiment around the stock appears attractive after the recent decline. A long position can be considered with a stop-loss placed at Rs 4,270. On the higher end, a target can be set at Rs 4,700.

"Vishal Sikka warns of AI valuation gap, urges Indian IT to evolve",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/vishal-sikka-warns-of-ai-valuation-gap-urges-indian-it-to-evolve-alpha-article-13773914.html,"The current valuations in the artificial intelligence sector do not add up, creating a significant gap between capital expenditure and revenue generation, according to Vishal Sikka, founder and CEO of Vianai Systems. In an interview with CNBC TV18, Sikka -- former CEO of Infosys -- warned of a hype cycle, noting that the economics of the massive spending on AI infrastructure are not currently supported by revenues. Sikka explained the discrepancy by breaking down the numbers. He pointed out that while a company like Nvidia generates approximately $250 billion annually from its GPU sales, the total ecosystem spending, including CPUs, memory, and networking, swells this figure to about $750-$800 billion a year. To justify this expenditure over a four-year amortisation period, the industry would need to generate around $200 billion in new revenue. ""Where is the 200 billion? There is no 200 billion. OpenAI's revenue is 15 billion, something like that. And so there is a huge gap,"" Sikka stated. He questioned how long this gap would be funded, acknowledging that while one could call it a bubble, the current reality is that the economics ""don't add up to what has been spent."" Addressing the impact on India's information technology services sector, Sikka asserted that AI is already capable of effectively automating well-defined, structured activities such as software development, maintenance, and business process execution. This means a much smaller team equipped with AI can perform the work previously done by a larger group. He urged Indian IT companies to embrace this transformation, even if it leads to lower short-term economic gains. The key to navigating this shift, he advised, is for these firms to become software companies in addition to being services companies. ""It has to be your own software,"" he emphasized. By developing proprietary AI platforms, IT firms can retain value even as the number of billable hours for projects decreases. This necessitates a business model adjustment away from purely people-based pricing towards fixed-fee, outcome-based approaches that account for the value of the software itself. Looking at India's position in the global AI race, Sikka expressed strong optimism, citing the nation's ""demographic dividend."" He described AI as a powerful tool, much like others invented throughout human history, that can empower India's large, young, and educated population. ""The great mandate for us is how do we make all our people able to use these tools to build amazing things for themselves, for our country, but also for the world,"" he said. Sikka believes that if India can successfully equip its billion-strong population to use AI effectively, the country will thrive. Furthermore, Sikka called for greater participation in building foundational AI technologies within India. Dismissing the notion that the country has missed its opportunity, he compared the current stage of AI development to being in the ""first over of a T20 match."" He expressed a desire to see a great foundation model built in India and highlighted immense opportunities for innovation. Future advancements, according to Sikka, lie in creating vertical foundation models for specific industries like healthcare, models trained on India's diverse local languages, and sophisticated ""world models"" that can understand the physical world and activities specific to the Indian context, such as traffic patterns and infrastructure.","The current valuations in the artificial intelligence sector do not add up, creating a significant gap between capital expenditure and revenue generation, according to Vishal Sikka, founder and CEO of Vianai Systems.","Future advancements, according to Sikka, lie in creating vertical foundation models for specific industries like healthcare, models trained on India's diverse local languages, and sophisticated ""world models"" that can understand the physical world and activities specific to the Indian context, such as traffic patterns and infrastructure.","Addressing the impact on India's information technology services sector, Sikka asserted that AI is already capable of effectively automating well-defined, structured activities such as software development, maintenance, and business process execution.","Dismissing the notion that the country has missed its opportunity, he compared the current stage of AI development to being in the ""first over of a T20 match.""",negative,0.5167262554168701
"India must build its own AI foundational models, says Vishal Sikka",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/india-must-build-its-own-ai-foundational-models-says-vishal-sikka-alpha-article-13773915.html,"Vishal Sikka, founder & CEO of Vianai Systems, has called for India to urgently develop its own foundational artificial intelligence models to avoid becoming a passive consumer of technology built elsewhere. In an interview with CNBC TV18, Sikka -- former CEO of Infosys -- emphasised that India is too large and the stakes too high for the nation to be absent from any layer of the AI ecosystem. ""We have to be central to AI ... at every layer, in every aspect of AI,"" Sikka stated, ahead of the India AI impact summit scheduled for next month. He argued that India possesses the capability to use and deliver AI at scale and should showcase its innovation and entrepreneurial spirit to the world. He said India must build its own foundation models, develop tools and applications on top, and enable hundreds of millions to deploy them, which are the core underpinning for platforms like ChatGPT. The former Infosys CEO highlighted a critical skill gap as a major challenge, describing the current global situation as a ""tale of two cities."" He noted that out of eight billion people worldwide, only about two million can build AI applications. The number shrinks dramatically to a few hundred thousand who can deploy AI in production, and fewer than 25,000 people on the entire planet possess the skills to create a frontier-level foundational model. ""These are not skills that are pre-ordained by God for a chosen few people… we have to really make these skills much more pervasive,"" he said. To address this, Sikka, who is on the board of Stanford's AI center, revealed that the upcoming summit will feature faculty from the university who will teach attendees how to build their own foundational models, aiming to proliferate the skill of building foundation models, which he argued can be learned. Sikka outlined a twofold concern regarding India's AI readiness. The first is the urgency to expand the skill base of people who understand AI's capabilities and limitations. The second is the imminent disruptive effect on key industries, particularly the IT services sector. He pointed out that Large Language Models (LLMs) are ""unreasonably effective at writing software,"" posing a direct challenge to traditional software development and maintenance roles. ""We have a short window of time in which to transform from the previous way of doing things to an AI-led way of doing things,"" Sikka warned, framing it as the most important equation for the times ahead. He stressed that the disruption is not a future event but is already happening. To illustrate the magnitude of the shift, he shared an anecdote of a complex system that took 15 experts nine months to build being replicated by a single person in just 14 days using modern AI tools. ""It is not a matter of when is it coming. It is here already,"" he asserted. Reflecting on his early decision to back OpenAI with a donation in 2015, he recalled that allocating resources to high-reward, unconventional ideas like these often seem ‘crazy’ at first. He urged a focus on the future, questioning what current opportunities might be missed today that will seem obvious in 2035. For him, the most significant imminent transformation lies in the complete overhaul of the IT landscape driven by AI.","He said India must build its own foundation models, develop tools and applications on top, and enable hundreds of millions to deploy them, which are the core underpinning for platforms like ChatGPT.","To address this, Sikka, who is on the board of Stanford's AI center, revealed that the upcoming summit will feature faculty from the university who will teach attendees how to build their own foundational models, aiming to proliferate the skill of building foundation models, which he argued can be learned.","He urged a focus on the future, questioning what current opportunities might be missed today that will seem obvious in 2035.","To address this, Sikka, who is on the board of Stanford's AI center, revealed that the upcoming summit will feature faculty from the university who will teach attendees how to build their own foundational models, aiming to proliferate the skill of building foundation models, which he argued can be learned.",neutral,0.8189577460289001

UNBK strategically shed bulk deposits, leading to lower CoF and thus 9bps QoQ margin improvement, but we believe core deposit growth remains a challenge for the bank (up ~0.5% YoY) and thus could keep margins in check amid another repo rate cut expected in 4Q.

"Chartist Talk: Ashish Kyal shares outlook for Vedanta, Union Bank, NALCO, MCX, Hindustan Copper, IndusInd Bank after sharp rally",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/chartist-talk-ashish-kyal-shares-outlook-for-vedanta-union-bank-nalco-mcx-hindustan-copper-indusind-bank-after-sharp-rally-13773715.html,"According to Ashish Kyal, the CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors, Hindustan Copper is currently approaching prior swing high of Rs 575 after taking a short breather. “Break above Rs 575 can extend the rally further towards Rs 600-650 levels,” he said in an interview to Moneycontrol. On NALCO, which gained 4.5% in last session, he is of view that as long as the stock does not see a close below prior day’s low, upside momentum is expected to continue with the upside targets of Rs 400 level or higher. He also shared his technical outlook on Union Ban of India, Vedanta, IndusInd Bank and MCX India after their strong rally in the recent session. On the Nifty 50, he feels Friday closing will decide trend for coming week and key levels to watch out for are 25,470 – 25,850 levels. Do you expect the Nifty 50 to break out of the 25,600–25,900 range of the past four days on the upside? Nifty since past 7 days has been failing to give a positive close above prior day’s high. Prices are witnessing selling pressure on upside and not able to cross above 25,850 on closing basis which is also high volume profile area. It will be important to see a close above this level by end of day on Friday which is next working day for upside breakout. On downside, any close below 25,470 by day-end will be sign of concern. Friday closing will decide trend for coming week and key levels to watch out for are 25,470 – 25,850 levels. The Bank Nifty has hovered around short-term moving averages over the last few days. Do you see the possibility of the banking index moving toward record highs rather than witnessing sharp selling pressure? Bank Nifty is holding 50 period EMA (Exponential moving average) and index is currently consolidating near the EMA support in between a range of 58,800-59,800. Consistent rally in PSU banks have limited downside movement in the Index. A break above 59,800 level can open doors for the targets of 60,400 followed by 61,000 levels. While a close below 58,800 can suggest that short term top has formed. Do you expect the record-high rally to continue in Vedanta, Union Bank of India, and MCX India? Vedanta has hit record highs on strong rise in commodity prices. However, after a 13% rally since January 2026, RSI is overbought, so dips can be used to buy as long as there is no close below the prior day’s low, with upside targets of Rs 730 or higher over the coming months. PSU banks continued to outperform. In the previous session, Union Bank of India surged nearly 8% post good quarterly results, forming a strong bullish candle for the first time in months. As long as the stock holds above Rs 165 level, the bias remains positive for upside targets of Rs 190 level or higher. Since September, Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX India) has been protecting prior week’s low on closing basis keeping bigger trend on sides of bulls. So, as long as key support of Rs 2,180 level remains protected on the downside one can use every decline to buy with the upside target of Rs 2,600 followed by Rs 2,800 level. Are you super bullish on Hindustan Copper and NALCO? Global uncertainties have caused huge rally in commodities such as gold, silver, aluminium, and copper to reach all-time high levels. Hindustan copper and NALCO which are directly linked to these metals, so both companies are directly benefitting from this rally. Hindustan Copper is currently approaching prior swing high of Rs 575 after taking a short breather and now a break above the same can extend the rally further towards Rs 600-650 levels with Rs 540 followed Rs 520 as immediate support levels. While NALCO is currently trading at the uncharted territory and has shown a sharp rally of nearly 13% within past one week. For now, as long as we do not see a close below prior day’s low, upside momentum is expected to continue with the upside targets of Rs 400 level or higher. On the downside, Rs 350 can act as an immediate support. Any break below it can result into short term profit booking. Do you think the Nifty Auto index is done with its correction and is expected to resume its upward journey soon? Nifty Auto index has lost most of its gains from recent rally and continued to drift lower by protecting prior day’s high on closing basis. The sector is currently standing at 50 EMA support of 27,700 level. A close below the same can accelerate further selling pressure towards 27,480 followed by 27,180 level. On the upside, a break above 28,180 can trigger short covering. Do you see a cup-and-handle pattern breakout in IndusInd Bank? If yes, does it indicate that the rally will continue? Yes, on the daily chart, IndusInd Bank has confirmed a breakout from a cup-and-handle pattern, followed by a successful retest, and has also moved above its prior swing high. Notably, volumes have picked up sharply for the first time since November 12, 2025, indicating strong participation and conviction in the ongoing move. As long as Rs 890 level remains protected on the downside, the rally is likely to extend further towards Rs 1,000 or higher. Do you expect the record-high rally to continue in the Nifty PSU Bank index? Since past one year, PSU Bank index has shown a clear outperformance as compared to Private Bank as it has surged by 30% in one year and continued to trade in a uncharted territory. This strong relative momentum suggests that the outperformance trend is likely to persist. On the upside, the index has the potential to move towards 9,000, followed by 9,200 levels, while 8,650 level remains a crucial support to watch.",Hindustan Copper is currently approaching prior swing high of Rs 575 after taking a short breather and now a break above the same can extend the rally further towards Rs 600-650 levels with Rs 540 followed Rs 520 as immediate support levels.,"On NALCO, which gained 4.5% in last session, he is of view that as long as the stock does not see a close below prior day’s low, upside momentum is expected to continue with the upside targets of Rs 400 level or higher.",Nifty Auto index has lost most of its gains from recent rally and continued to drift lower by protecting prior day’s high on closing basis.,"On NALCO, which gained 4.5% in last session, he is of view that as long as the stock does not see a close below prior day’s low, upside momentum is expected to continue with the upside targets of Rs 400 level or higher.",positive,0.9047977328300476

If it falls below this level, it could retest the levels of 25,500-25,450/83000-82800. Gaurav Garg, Lemonn Markets Desk The benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty witnessed sharp intraday volatility on Wednesday as caution prevailed amid sustained foreign fund outflows and global tariff-related concerns. After slipping to early lows, domestic markets pared most of their losses on the back of selective value buying and traded largely flat by mid-afternoon. The Sensex fell to a low of 83,185.20 before recovering nearly 350 points to trade at 83,505.56, down 0.15 percent, while the Nifty hovered near the 25,700 level at 25,692.30, lower by 0.16 percent. Buying interest emerged in pockets such as metals, oil and gas, and consumer durables, helping limit the downside after recent corrections. Market sentiment remains fragile, with both indices having declined in six of the last seven sessions amid concerns over US tariff measures, geopolitical tensions and persistent foreign portfolio outflows. FPIs have sold nearly ₹16,600 crore worth of equities so far in January, following heavy outflows in 2025. Additional volatility was driven by the advancement of the weekly derivatives expiry to Wednesday, while positive cues from Asian markets provided some support. From a technical perspective, the Nifty managed to hold above the 25,620–25,715 support zone. A sustained move above 25,715 could trigger a recovery towards 26,020, while a break below 25,600 may open the downside towards 25,300.
