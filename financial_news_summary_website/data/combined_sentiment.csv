"Maruti Suzuki shares decline up to 3% on missing Q3 profit estimates, drag auto index up to 2%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/maruti-suzuki-shares-decline-up-to-3-on-missing-q3-profit-estimates-drag-auto-index-up-to-2-13796311.html,"Maruti Suzuki India shares declined up to 3 percent on Thursday after the country’s largest carmaker reported December quarter results that fell short of profit estimates, dragging the auto index lower. The stock fell as much as 3.5 percent in early trade following the earnings announcement. On the BSE, shares of Maruti Suzuki traded 3.4 percent lower at Rs 14,370, while on the NSE, they quoted 3.52 percent lower at Rs 14,353. With this, the stock extended its losing streak to a seventh consecutive session and has declined about 11 percent so far. The shares are down nearly 13.6 percent in January, so far. Maruti Suzuki said its consolidated profit for the December quarter rose 4 percent year-on-year to Rs 3,794 crore, impacted by higher costs and a one-time provision of Rs 594 crore related to the new Labour Codes. The profit, however, missed analysts’ expectations of Rs 4,261 crore. The stock has also remained under pressure after India and the European Union earlier this week announced tariff cuts on European car imports. Ambit Capital, which has a ‘Sell’ rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 13,286, said margins are being weighed down by higher electric vehicle spending, new capacity-related costs and a shift towards lower-margin models. It added that the company’s volume-led strategy risks prioritising market share over profitability. Emkay Global, which has a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock, said it remains positive on Maruti Suzuki’s long-term prospects, citing its aggressive product pipeline and expectations of a recovery in small car demand after years of subdued growth. However, the brokerage cut its price target by 4.5 percent to Rs 17,000, citing rising commodity pressures. Auto index see profit booking The sharp fall in Maruti Suzuki shares weighed on the Nifty Auto index, which declined up to 2 percent during the session. TVS Motor Company, Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki India and Exide Industries were among the major laggards in the auto index, with losses of up to 3 percent. Auto shares also came under pressure following reports that India will sharply reduce import duties on high-end European cars, lowering rates to 30 percent from as much as 110 percent under a new trade agreement with the European Union. The move would significantly open India’s auto market, benefiting luxury manufacturers such as BMW and Mercedes-Benz. India and the EU concluded the trade agreement on Tuesday, which is set to reduce tariffs across a wide range of goods and strengthen bilateral trade.

"Hindustan Copper shares surge 18%, metal index gains for 3rd day: What's behind the rally?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hindustan-copper-shares-surge-18-metal-index-gains-for-3rd-day-what-s-behind-the-rally-13796372.html,"Metal stocks extended their sharp surge for the third consecutive session on January 29, pushing the Nifty Metal index up more than 2 percent in the morning trading hours. Hindustan Copper shares were the top gainers on the index, jumping around 18 percent to hit an all-time high of Rs 745 apiece on Thursday. The stock has now rallied a whopping 305 percent in just nine months from its 52-week low of Rs 183.82 apiece, which it had hit in April this year. The Nifty Metal index rose to a record high of 12,359.05. This comes despite an overall bearish sentiment in markets, with benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty in the red. Why are Hindustan Copper shares rallying? Hindustan Copper shares have seen a sharp surge in recent days, rallying more than 39 percent in just three sessions so far after the company announced on January 24 that it has emerged as the preferred bidder for Baghwari-Khirkhori Copper and associated mineral block in Madhya Pradesh. The company had participated in the state government’s e-auction for the grant of mining lease and composite license for the said block. “Since, HCL had submitted the highest final price offer, it has been declared as the Preferred Bidder for this auction,” it said. The sharp surge in the shares of the Vedanta Group-company also comes amid the rally in copper prices, after the red metal gained 60 percent in 2025. Copper’s long-term fundamentals remain strong, and Indian investors increasingly seek global commodity exposure to help diversify their portfolios and use as hedges against inflation, said Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead, VT Markets. Why are metal stocks rising? Notably, gold and silver prices also jumped today, boosting the overall sentiment for metals. Gold futures with February expiry on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) jumped 9 percent to hit an all-time high of Rs 1,80,779 per 10 grams. The contracts with April and June expiries also surged around 9 percent each to fresh lifetime highs. Silver futures with March expiry meanwhile gained around 6 percent to hit a fresh all-time high of Rs 4,07,456 per kilogram. The contracts with May and July expiries also jumped around 6 percent each to their respective lifetime highs. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve decided to leave rates unchanged on Wednesday, as widely expected. However, investors are actively looking forward to some boost for manufacturing in the upcoming Budget, which will likely in turn may push the metal stocks further up. Growth in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) accelerated for the second straight month to a 26-month high of 7.8 percent on-year in December, compared with an upwardly revised 7.2 percent in November, driven by robust consumer demand, data released yesterday showed. On a sectoral basis, mining and electricity were drivers of higher IIP growth in December, while manufacturing growth moderated a little. Other metal stocks: National Aluminium Company (NALCO) gained more than 4 percent, while Jindal Steel shares gained nearly 4 percent, as seen at 10.45 am on January 29. Hindalco Industries, Vedanta, NMDC and Tata Steel shares gained around 2 percent each, while Steel Authority of India (SAIL), Hindustan Zinc and JSW Steel shares were up over 1 percent each. Jindal Stainless shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. Bucking the trend, APL Apollo Tubes, Adani Enterprises and Welspun Corp shares fell up to 1 percent.

We factor in: 1) Volume CAGR of 7% over FY25–28E driven by market share gains from unorganised players in the Tiles segment, 2) Bathware segment revenue CAGR of 12% over FY25–28E, 3) Revenue contribution of 17%/12% from Projects/Bathware segments, respectively. Strong launches and sales in the Real Estate sector between FY22 and FY25 would help drive volume growth for SOMC over FY26–28E as these projects near completion, 4) EBITDA margin expansion of ~316 bps over FY25–28E. We forecast SOMC EBITDA/EPS CAGR of 20/44% over FY25–28E on the basis of our volume/realisation CAGR assumption of 7%/0.4% over the same period. We revise our 1-year forward target price for SOMC to INR 575/share (earlier INR 635/share). Our EPS estimate is reduced by 10.8% and 10.4% for FY26 and FY27E, respectively, primarily reflecting a 2% cut in the expected volume CAGR over FY25–FY28E. We value SOMC on our PEG ratio-based framework – we assign a PEG ratio of 0.9x on FY25–28E core EPS CAGR of 44%, which, we believe, is a conservative multiple. This valuation framework gives us the flexibility to assign a commensurate valuation multiple based on quantifiable earnings growth. Outlook We do a sanity check of our PEG ratio-based TP using implied EV/EBITDA, P/BV and P/E multiples. On our TP of INR 575, FY27E implied EVEBITDA/PB/PE multiples are 7.6x/2.4x/17.6x, all of which are reasonable in our view.

"Gold ETFs surge up to 13%, outperform silver ETFs as precious metals extend rally to record highs",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-etfs-surge-up-to-13-outperform-silver-etfs-as-precious-metals-extend-rally-to-record-highs-13796240.html,"Gold and silver ETFs gained sharply on January 29, tracking the sharp rise in the precious metal. However, the yellow metal’s ETFs are currently outperforming those of silver after several sessions. Gold futures with February expiry on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) jumped 9 percent to hit an all-time high of Rs 1,80,779 per 10 grams. The contracts with April and June expiries also surged around 9 percent each to fresh lifetime highs. Silver futures with March expiry meanwhile gained around 6 percent to hit a fresh all-time high of Rs 4,07,456 per kilogram. The contracts with May and July expiries also jumped around 6 percent each to their respective lifetime highs. Why are gold and silver prices surging today? ""Growing U.S. debt and uncertainty created by signs that the global trade system is splintering into regional blocs as opposed to a U.S.-centric model (are leading investors to pile into gold),"" Reuters quoted Marex analyst Edward Meir as saying. This comes after US President Donald Trump urged Iran to engage in negotiations and strike a deal on nuclear weapons. He warned that any future US attack would be far more severe than the one in 2025 when Iranian nuclear sites were struck. Tehran responded with a threat to strike back against the US, Israel and those who support them. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve decided to leave rates unchanged on Wednesday, as widely expected. the precious metal also drew support from crypto group 's plans to allocate 10–15 percent of its investment portfolio to physical gold. Gold, silver ETFs jump: Kotak Gold ETF surged more than 13 percent to hit a fresh all-time high of Rs 155 apiece, while Baroda BNP Paribas Gold ETF gained around 10 percent. Axis Gold ETF, 360 ONE Gold ETF, Union Gold ETF, LIC MF ETF and others gained around 9 percent each. Motilal Oswal Silver ETF meanwhile gained around 8 percent to hit a fresh lifetime high of Rs 371.91 apiece. Nippon India Silver ETF and few others also gained around 8 percent each in the morning. Gold vs silver: Motilal Oswal Financial Services in a recent note highlighted that silver has delivered an exceptional rally of over 200 percent in the past 12 months, sharply outperforming gold’s 80 percent rise during the same period. This made silver one of the strongest-performing assets globally. However, the domestic brokerage noted that this sharp outperformance of the white metal has led to a significant compression in the gold–silver ratio, which has fallen from pandemic highs of 127 to around 50 at the beginning of 2026. “This reset suggests that while the long-term outlook for precious metals remains constructive, the near-term risk-reward equation may now be shifting in favour of gold after silver’s outsized run,” Motilal said. “Silver has delivered sharp outperformance in a short span, and with the gold–silver ratio now near lower levels, the near-term risk-reward is turning more favourable for gold. While we remain positive on both metals and silver continues to have long-term upside backed by industrial demand and tight physical market conditions, the recent rally has also increased near-term volatility. In this phase, a higher allocation to gold can help manage fluctuations while staying invested in precious metals,” said Navneet Damani, Head of Research Commodities and Manav Modi, Commodities Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. However, the domestic brokerage emphasized that it does not have a negative view on silver. But, it suggests a risk-managed reallocation strategy after an aggressive up move. It added that silver has become more volatile with sharper price swings, while gold continues to offer relatively better stability—making it a preferred near-term hedge in uncertain market conditions. Despite the sharp surge in prices, global silver ETFs have seen outflows of over 3 million ounces since the start of 2026, while gold ETFs have witnessed comparatively steadier inflows, reflecting investor preference for more defensive positioning, Motilal added. Also read: Is it time to shift money from equities to precious metals? Here's what analysts say The brokerage advises investors a 75 percent allocation to gold and 25 percent to silver, indicating a preference for gold as a relatively steadier hedge in the current environment, while still retaining meaningful exposure to silver’s long-term structural upside. “Going forward, we believe investors can benefit from a rebalanced precious metals strategy—retaining silver as a long-term structural theme, while increasing gold allocation to manage near-term volatility and capture a potentially stronger risk-adjusted opportunity in the next phase of the cycle,” Damani said. Long-term investors may consider staggered allocation within asset allocation limits, while short-term traders should remain cautious amid continued volatility, said Aditya Agrawal, Chief Investment Officer at Avisa Wealth Creators.

Brokerages have increased their target prices for the stock, citing several reasons. The shares of the company rose to Rs 3,932.6 in the early trading hours of Thursday, extending gains for the third consecutive session. L&T Q3 Results: Larsen & Toubro (L&T) reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 3,215 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 4 percent YoY fall from Rs 3,358.84 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. This however included a one-time exceptional cost of Rs 1,191 crore due to the implementation of new labour codes last year. Moneycontrol's poll of brokerages had estimated the firm’s net profit to rise to Rs 4,524 crore. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose 10.5 percent YoY to Rs 71,449.70 crore, missing MC poll estimate of Rs 75,011 crore. The Group’s consolidated order book as on December 31, 2025, stood at Rs 7,33,161 crore, reflecting a 30 percent YoY growth. International orders constituted 49 percent of the overall order book. Motilal Oswal on L&T: Motilal Oswal maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock, while raising its target price for the stock to Rs 4,600 apiece from Rs 4,500 earlier. The latest target price implies an upside potential of more than 21 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage said that the firm’s consolidated Q3 earnings were slightly below its estimates due to weaker-than-expected execution for core E&C. Revenue growth for core E&C, which has remained weak for the last two quarters, is expected to ramp up from the fourth quarter. On the positive side, Motilal said that order inflows remained strong, driven by large order wins in domestic and international markets, providing healthy visibility for revenue. An improved prospect pipeline, further reduction in NWC and healthy RoE give comfort in an environment where domestic execution and margin performance in select segments were weak, it added. JM Financial on L&T: JM Financial maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock, while raising its target price for the stock to Rs 4,655 apiece from Rs 4,500 earlier. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 23 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage noted that the company yet again reported a strong delivery on order inflows, significantly exceeding estimates. “We estimate 24% FY26E order inflows (vs 10%+ guidance) factoring in Q3 strength and a robust international outlook. We expect the order inflow strength to sustain in FY27 (est 11% growth). We raise our FY28E core EBITDA by 3% factoring in stronger FY26 inflows,” it said. Nomura on L&T: Nomura maintained its ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 4,510 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 19 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage noted that the company delivered robust order inflows, but execution missed estimates. It cut FY27–28 EBITDA estimates by 1-3 percent to factor in weaker energy segment margin. Jefferies on L&T: Jefferies maintained its ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 4,715 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 24 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm’s Q3 EBITDA was 4 percent above estimates, and margin also improved. Potential discussions on semiconductor investments and Hyderabad Metro moving off books are positive triggers ahead, it added.

Track the latest updates on GIFT Nifty right here on Moneycontrol. Indian equity markets extended their winning streak for the second consecutive session on January 28, supported by buying interest in energy and metal names. After opening on a positive note, the market advanced further in the first half, with the Nifty testing an intraday high of 25,372.10. However, mid-session profit booking pared most of the gains, but final hour buying helped to close near day's high.

US Equities (Up) The Nasdaq rose ​slightly with a boost from chip stocks while the S&P 500 closed virtually unchanged on Wednesday as investor reactions were muted after the Federal Reserve ‌kept interest rates unchanged as expected and gave little indication when borrowing costs might fall again.

Asian Currencies (Mixed) Asian currencies were trading mixed in the early Thursday trade with Thai Baht leading the losers followed by Philippines Peso, Malaysian Ringgit, Taiwan Dollar. Crude (Up) Oil prices rose for a third day on Thursday on increasing concerns the U.S. may carry out a military attack on key Middle Eastern producer Iran that could disrupt supply from the region.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Union Bank of India, NMDC, Rail Vikas Nigam, City Union Bank, and others on January 29?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-union-bank-of-india-nmdc-rail-vikas-nigam-city-union-bank-and-others-on-january-29-13795717.html,"Equity benchmarks gained six-tenths of a percent, extending the rally for the second straight session, with bulls backing market breadth on January 28. About 2,254 shares advanced, compared to 663 declining shares on the NSE. The market may consolidate after the two-day gains, with support placed at the previous day’s low. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities NMDC | CMP: Rs 81.52 NMDC has moved above the 200 DMA on the hourly chart, indicating an improvement in sentiment. On the daily chart, it has reclaimed the 50 DMA. The trend appears to be strengthening again, and with a positive crossover in the daily RSI, the price may move higher in the coming sessions. On the higher end, the stock could move towards the Rs 87–90 zone in the short term. On the lower end, support is placed at Rs 78.50; a break below this level may weaken sentiment. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 90 Stop-Loss: Rs 78.50 Rail Vikas Nigam | CMP: Rs 342.5 Rail Vikas Nigam has given a consolidation breakout on the daily chart, suggesting a rise in optimism. Additionally, the price has reclaimed and closed comfortably above the 50 DMA. The daily RSI has entered a bullish crossover, indicating strengthening momentum. On the higher end, the stock could move towards Rs 360 in the short term. On the lower end, support is placed at Rs 330; a break below this level may weaken sentiment. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 360 Stop-Loss: Rs 330 City Union Bank | CMP: Rs 293.3 City Union Bank has given a consolidation breakout on the daily chart, indicating improving sentiment. The price has been sustaining above the 21 EMA as well as the 50 EMA, confirming strength. The daily RSI is in a bullish crossover and trending higher. On the higher end, the stock could move towards Rs 330 in the short term. On the lower end, support is placed at Rs 278; a break below this level may weaken sentiment. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 330 Stop-Loss: Rs 278 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities Union Bank of India | CMP: Rs 181.93 Union Bank broke out above its major swing high zone of Rs 171–173 on January 14, supported by a clear rise in volumes, signaling a strong breakout. However, the stock failed to show immediate follow-through and retested the breakout zone, which acted as a strong support area as fresh buying interest emerged. A decisive follow-through move was seen on Wednesday, with the stock closing 3.84 percent higher. The stock continues to trade well above its key short-term and long-term moving averages, and the overall price structure suggests a high probability of further upside in the coming sessions. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the Rs 183–181 zone with a stop-loss of Rs 175. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 195 in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 195 Stop-Loss: Rs 175 Power Finance Corporation | CMP: Rs 383.05 PFC had been consolidating in a falling channel since the start of January before staging a decisive breakout, backed by a strong surge in volumes, indicating fresh buying interest. The RSI, which earlier struggled to sustain above the 60 mark, has now firmly moved past this level, signaling a clear pickup in bullish momentum. The DI+ crossing above DI– on the ADX indicator further confirms strengthening positive trend strength. Additionally, a fresh breakout in the Nifty PSE / Nifty ratio chart suggests potential near-term outperformance, positioning PFC as a likely leader within the sector. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the Rs 385–380 zone with a stop-loss of Rs 370. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 410 in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 410 Stop-Loss: Rs 370","The trend appears to be strengthening again, and with a positive crossover in the daily RSI, the price may move higher in the coming sessions.","Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 330 Stop-Loss: Rs 278 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities Union Bank of India | CMP: Rs 181.93 Union Bank broke out above its major swing high zone of Rs 171–173 on January 14, supported by a clear rise in volumes, signaling a strong breakout.","On the lower end, support is placed at Rs 78.50; a break below this level may weaken sentiment.","On the higher end, the stock could move towards the Rs 87–90 zone in the short term.",positive,0.5260287523269653

Outlook for January 29 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing decent bounce back with high volatility on Tuesday, Nifty witnessed a sustainable follow-through up move on Wednesday and closed the day higher by 167 points. After opening on a positive note, the market showed volatility within a range for better part of the session. The sharp upside has emerged towards the end and Nifty closed higher. A reasonable bull candle has been formed on the daily chart with upper and lower shadow. Technically, this market action indicates continuation of Pre-Budget rally and the market is now placed at the edge of breaking above the crucial overhead resistance of 25450 levels. The overall chart pattern of Nifty indicates a formation of short-term bottom reversal for the market. A sustainable move above the hurdle of 25450-25500 levels could open broad based rally for the Nifty towards 25800 levels in the near term. Immediate support is placed at 25200 levels. Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities Nifty opened on a strong note but quickly lost momentum, leading to range-bound trade for the major part of the day before sharp surge towards the last hour of the day led to Index closing 0.66% higher at 25,343. On the daily chart, the index has formed a bullish candle with a relatively long lower wick, indicating strong buying interest at lower levels. Despite the strong close above its 200-Day EMA, the Index has been hovering around this key level since last five sessions, underscoring persistent indecision and a tug-of-war between bulls and bears at this crucial long-term support. Going ahead, the key support for Nifty is placed in the 25,200–25,150 zone, which coincides with the 200-day EMA zone. A decisive breakdown below this zone could result in Nifty extending its weakness towards 24,900, followed by 24,600 in the near term. On the upside, the 25,450–25,500 zone is expected to act as an immediate resistance zone.

"BEL, BEML, other defence shares rise up to 12%, Nifty defence index soars 5%: Here are three likely reasons",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bel-beml-other-defence-shares-rise-up-to-12-nifty-defence-index-soars-5-here-are-three-likely-reasons-13794883.html,"Defence shares advanced on Wednesday, with Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL), BEML rising up to 12 percent, driven by broad-based buying across the sector. The strong momentum pushed the Nifty India Defence index up by around 5 percent during the session. Key factors behind the sharp rise in defence shares 1) India-EU defence pact: India and the European Union on Tuesday concluded a defence and security agreement aimed at enhancing cooperation in areas such as counter-terrorism, the Indo-Pacific and joint development of military hardware. The pact was finalised at the India-EU summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and European Council President Antonio Costa. Officials said the agreement would improve interoperability in the defence sector and create opportunities for Indian companies to participate in the EU’s Security Action for Europe (SAFE) programme, supporting long-term growth prospects for domestic defence manufacturers. 2) Rub-off from BEL rally: Shares of BEL jumped 10 percent to a record high of Rs 457.50 after the firm reported a 20.4 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit for the December quarter, while revenue from operations increased nearly 24 percent. BEL, which is also a constituent of the Nifty 50 index, saw heavy buying interest, triggering a spillover effect across other defence stocks. 3) Pre-Budget rally: The rally also comes ahead of the Union Budget scheduled for February 1. The Nifty India Defence index gained about 5 percent amid expectations that the government may announce a meaningful increase in capital expenditure for the defence sector, according to brokerage firms. The index extended gains for a second straight day and has risen more than 8 percent over the past two sessions.

Accumulate ABB India; target of Rs 5540: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/accumulate-abb-india-target-of-rs-5540-prabhudas-lilladher-2-13794377.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ABB India ABB IN has announced its intention to divest its Robotics business, in line with the global parent’s divestment of ABB Robotics Schweiz AG (“ARSAG”) to SoftBank Group. As part of the divestment, ABB IN incorporated ABB Robotics India Private Limited (“INRBT”) as a wholly owned subsidiary and proposes to transfer its Robotics business to INRBT on a slump-sale basis for a consideration of Rs15.7bn. ABB IN then will sell its entire stake in INRBT to ARSAG. The transaction is expected to be completed by 27 February 2026. In our view, the deal is value-accretive for ABB IN, implied at ~2.2x EV/TTM sales and ~24.4x EV/TTM EBIT (inc. other income). The divestment is likely to sharpen the company’s focus on its core portfolio and support at least 10-15bps improvement in EBIT margins in CY26E and CY27E. Additionally, the exit should marginally enhance return ratios, driven by the elimination of negative net capital employed in the Robotics business. Outlook The stock is currently trading at a PE of 53.3x/45.9x on CY26/27E. We have a ‘Accumulate’ rating on the stock valuing it at a multiple of 56x Sep’27E (same as earlier) arriving at a TP of Rs5,540 (same as earlier).

"ONGC, Oil India shares jump up to 10% to new record highs as oil prices rise",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ongc-oil-india-shares-jump-up-to-10-to-new-record-highs-as-oil-prices-rise-13794243.html,"The shares of state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India jumped up to 10 percent in trade on January 28, tracking the sharp rise in oil prices. This comes amid supply concerns after a severe winter storm disrupted US crude output and exports. Additionally, rising tensions in the Middle East also supported oil prices. Brent crude futures rose 33 cents to $67.90 a barrel, while WTI Crude futures gained 42 cents to trade at $62.81 per barrel, as seen at 11 am. The two stocks were among the top gainers on the Nifty Oil & Gas index, which was up more than 3 percent at 11,735.55. Why are oil prices rising? Oil extended gains as analysts estimated that US producers lost up to 2 million barrels per day or roughly 15 percent of national output over the weekend as the storm strained energy infrastructure and power grids. Crude and liquefied natural gas exports from U.S. Gulf Coast ports tumbled to zero on Sunday, Reuters quoted ship tracking service Vortexa as saying. The report added that Toshitaka Tazawa, an analyst at Fujitomi Securities, said that a loss of production in Kazakhstan is also underpinning the rally in oil prices. ""But once supply fears ease, selling pressure is likely to return,"" Tazawa added. He further said that an estimated global crude supply surplus this year amid geopolitical risks, including the Middle East tensions, could keep WTI trading around $60 a barrel for now. Tensions between US and Iran are also supporting oil prices. Reuters reported citing sources that a US aircraft carrier and supporting warships have arrived in the Middle East. This has raised the prospect of US President Donald Trump following through on his threat to attack Iran's senior leadership in response to the violent crackdown on nationwide protests, said ANZ analysts in a note. ONGC share price: ONGC shares jumped more than 7 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 266.2 apiece. Earlier yesterday, ONGC announced that it entered into Ship Building Contracts (SBCs) with South Korea’s Samsung Heavy Industries for the construction of two state-of-the-art Very Large Ethane Carriers (VLEC). “ONGC and MOL Japan have set up two joint venture companies, Bharat Ethane One IFSC Pvt. Ltd. and Bharat Ethane Two IFSC Pvt. Ltd., in GIFT City, Gujarat, with each company owning and operating one VLEC. These vessels will support the transportation of about 600 KTPA of ethane for OPaL, a subsidiary of ONGC,” the company said in a press release.

The shares of the Vedanta Group-company dropped to Rs 705.10 apiece in the early trading hours of Wednesday, snapping a two-session gaining streak. Why are Hindustan Zinc shares falling today? Hindustan Zinc shares are falling today after promoter Vedanta announced announced that its committee of directors has approved the plan to sell up to 6.7 crore equity shares, representing 1.59 percent stake in Hindustan Zinc, through an offer for sale (OFS). The floor price for the OFS has been set at Rs 685 apiece, marking a 6 percent discount from yesterday's closing price. At the said floor price, Vedanta will raise Rs 4,589.50 crore through the sale of the shares. The OFS will open for non-retail investors on January 28, and for retail investors on January 29. Vedanta has sold portions of its stake in Hindustan Zinc twice in the past two years to help shore up its balance sheet. According to data on Hindustan Zinc’s latest shareholding pattern, promoter Vedanta held 61.84 percent stake in the company, as on December 31 last year. After the stake sale, the holding company’s stake holding will likely reduce to 60.25 percent.

"DCB Bank Q3 FY26: Earnings momentum builds, re-rating still has legs",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/dcb-bank-q3-fy26-earnings-momentum-builds-re-rating-still-has-legs-13793999.html,"Highlights DCB Bank (CMP: Rs 198; Market cap: Rs 6,379 crore; Rating: Overweight) reported its highest-ever quarterly profit of Rs 185 crore in Q3 FY26, marking an increase of 23 percent YoY (year-on-year) despite one-off expense related to new labour code. The bank’s performance was broad-based, driven by healthy loan growth, robust fee income, better margins, improvement in operating efficiency, stronger asset quality, and contained credit costs. More encouragingly, the management expects margin expansion to continue through Q2 FY27, assuming no further rate cuts by the RBI. It has guided for a ROE (return on equity) of 13.5 percent in FY26 and 14.5 percent in FY27 — levels the bank has already effectively achieved in Q3 FY26. The reported ROA (return on asset) and the ROE for the quarter stood at 0.91 percent and 12.73 percent, respectively. However, excluding the one-off impact of the new labour code, the ROA would have been 1.01 percent and the ROE a healthy 14.1 percent in Q3 FY26, underscoring the underlying strength of profitability. DCB Bank’s stock has outperformed the sector benchmark (Bank Nifty) and overall market (Nifty) surging 46 percent and 70 percent in the past 6 months and 1 year respectively. The key question now is whether this rally can sustain. The most compelling aspect of DCB Bank is its valuation. Even after a sharp rally, the stock trades at only 0.9x its estimated FY27 book value, making it attractive. While a valuation re-rating hinges on the bank’s ability to sustain consistent performance, several profitability levers are in place that could drive further upside. Healthy business growth, robust fee income DCB Bank has maintained steady growth, with net advances rising to Rs 56,600 crore as of December 2025, reflecting a 18 percent YoY increase. DCB Bank aims to double its balance sheet over the next 3-3.5 years, targeting an annual loan growth of 18-22 percent. Mortgages constitute around 50 percent of the loan book as of September end. DCB’s deposits grew by 20 percent YoY till end December’25, higher than the banking system deposit growth, albeit on a smaller base. DCB’s CASA deposits ratio of 23 percent remains much lower compared to the banking system average. That said, it is reassuring to see the bank strengthening the granularity of its deposit base. Deposits from the top 20 depositors have come down to 6.61 percent of total deposits as of December 2025, compared to 15 percent in FY18, which adds stability to its funding profile. DCB Bank’s core fee income grew a strong 29 percent YoY, driven by robust traction in third-party distribution, trade finance, and processing fees. The management expects this momentum to sustain in Q4, which is seasonally strong for fee income. Over the medium term, the bank is confident of sustaining fee income at around 1 percent of average assets, broadly in line with the 1.1 percent achieved in Q3 FY26. Margin expansion to continue DCB’s net interest margin (NIM) came in at 3.27 percent in Q3 FY26, up 2 basis points YoY from the previous quarter (Q2 FY26). The management has guided to a gradual margin expansion from here onward till Q2 FY27, assuming the RBI doesn’t implement further rate cuts. The improvement is expected to play out over the next 3-4 quarters as the bank’s long-tenure fixed deposits will mature and get repriced at lower rates. In addition to lower funding costs, improved yields are expected to drive margin expansion. Over the past five years, DCB Bank has steadily built its home loan portfolio, which now accounts for nearly half of its mortgage book. Going forward, the bank aims to raise the share of business loans (LAP), which generate higher yields than home loans, while keeping the lower-margin co-lending portfolio capped at 15 percent of total advances. The bank had borrowings of more than Rs 8,000 crore as of March’25, which has declined to less than Rs 5,000 crore as the bank replaced it with relatively lower cost deposits. Together, the decline in funding costs and a more profitable product mix should support margin expansion. Operating efficiency improves DCB Bank effectively controlled its operating expenses aided by a reduction in employee base. Despite the one-off expense of Rs 27 crore in Q3 FY26, the cost-to-average assets ratio remained stable at 2.59 percent in Q3 FY26. Looking forward, the bank expects to benefit from the operating leverage as the balance sheet grows further. The management anticipates the cost-to-average-assets ratio to remain steady in the range of 2.5-2.6 percent and targets a cost-to-income ratio of 60 percent or below in the near term. Asset quality strengthens DCB Bank’s asset quality improved meaningfully in Q3 FY26, with a decline in both gross and net NPAs. More importantly, slippages fell to an 18-quarter low, signalling better asset quality trends. As a result, credit costs remained contained at just 37 bps—well below management’s guided 45 bps—even after accounting for floating provisions. The restructured book eased slightly but remains elevated at Rs 811 crore (1.4 percent of advances) as of December 2025 and needs to be monitored closely. View and Valuation Overall, DCB bank is poised for a healthy loan growth, margin expansion (assuming no further rate cut), stable cost-to-assets ratio, and a very low credit cost in near to medium term. This guidance is very encouraging and should drive healthy earnings growth in FY27 Despite the sharp rally post earnings, DCB Bank is trading at just 1 time FY27 estimated book value. The valuation can move above 1x forward BV on sectoral tailwinds which along with healthy earnings growth will drive a meaningful stock upside in the near to medium term.

Asian Paints shares tumble 7% after 'lacklustre' Q3 results; brokerages expect delay in demand recovery,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/asian-paints-shares-tumble-7-after-lacklustre-q3-results-brokerages-expect-delay-in-demand-recovery-13794089.html,"The shares of Asian Paints tumbled nearly 7 percent on January 28 as brokerages analysed the company's results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. The shares of the paint-maker dropped to Rs 2,451 apiece in the early trading hours of Wednesday. This is the lowest level seen by the stock since October last year. Asian Paints Q3 Results: Asian Paints on January 28 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,060 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 4.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall from Rs 1,110.48 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. This however includes exceptional items of Rs 157.61 crore due to labour code and Impairment loss following acquisition of Obgenix Software Private Limited ('White Teak'). The firm's revenue from operations meanwhile rose around 4 percent YoY to Rs 8,867.02 crore. Consolidated net sales increased 3.9 percent YoY to Rs 8,849.7 crore during the quarter under review. Motilal Oswal on Asian Paints: Motilal Oswal said that Asian Paints delivered a ""lacklustre performance"" as growth delivery remained soft despite a favorable base and multiple initiatives. ""A shorter festive period and an extended monsoon did weigh on 3Q performance and further delay demand recovery,"" the brokerage said. ""The management commentary on demand recovery was uninspiring, especially after the constructive commentary post-2QFY26. APNT expects volumes to be in the 8-10% range and value growth of ~5% in the near term. That said, management maintained its EBITDA margin guidance of 18-20%, aided by formulation and sourcing efficiencies. We model 10% revenue CAGR over FY26-28E along with ~19% EBITDA margin for FY27/FY28E,"" Motilal added. Given slower demand recovery and competitive pressure, Motilal expects the near-term growth outlook to remain muted. ""However, as the paint category enjoys pentup demand, we will be watchful if the recovery pace picks up faster in the coming seasonal quarters. The company is focusing on product innovation, brand salience, regionalization, and execution excellence to negate competitive pressure,"" it added. Motilal cut its EPS estimates by 1-3 percent over FY26-28E. It reiterated its ‘Neutral’ rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 2,950 apiece, which implies an upside potential of nearly 12.5 percent over the stock's previous closing price. JM Financial on Asian Paints: JM Financial said that the company's Q3 results were marginally below expectation. ""Decorative volume/value growth of 7.9%/2.8% YoY was below ours and consensus estimate, despite weak base, owing to shorter festive (impacted October sales, November/December had better growth) and extended monsoons. Management remains cautious on demand trends – a) sees mid-single-digit sales growth as reasonable in near term led by volume growth of c.8-10% and negative price/mix impact of c.4-5% (similar to trends seen in 2Q/3Q), b) prolonged softness in industry growth seen due to some reduction in frequency of painting/occasion-led painting and consumer shift to other discretionary spends. Moreover, based on current trends the negative mix impact (c.4-5%) is likely to sustain for next few quarters (will percolate into FY27E),"" the brokerage said. It cut FY27/28E earnings estimate by 2-3 percent. JM Financial maintained its ‘Reduce’ call on the stock, while lowering its target price to Rs 2,735 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 4 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. CLSA on Asian Paints: CLSA kept an ‘Underperform’ call on the shares of Asian Paints, with a target price of Rs 1,875 apiece. This implies a downside potential of more than 28.5 percent over the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm’s consolidated revenue growth was 2 percent below forecast, while standalone volume growth of 7.9 percent was in-line with an earlier festive season. It cut FY26-28 earnings estimate by 0-7 percent to account for persistence in gap between revenue and volume growth. HSBC on Asian Paints: HSBC downgraded the shares of Asian Paints to ‘Hold’, and cut its target price to Rs 2,900 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 11 percent over the previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm saw disappointing volume and revenue growth in Q3 FY26.

Bruised but Not Broken: These stocks are worth a bet amid the market weakness,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/bruised-but-not-broken-stocks-worth-a-bet-amid-the-market-weakness-13793924.html,"Indian equity investors endured a bruising 2025, marked by heightened volatility and the weakest relative performance versus Asian peers in nearly three decades. Lacklustre corporate earnings, slowing consumption, higher valuations, adverse tariff outcomes, weakening currency, and heavy foreign outflows all weighed on Indian equities over the past year. While 2026 too has begun on a fragile note, rattled by global uncertainty and persistent foreign investor selling, there are emerging silver linings. Policy measures aimed at reviving domestic growth, including the biggest GST overhaul in eight years, tax cuts, and monetary easing, should help cushion the impact of global headwinds, particularly those arising from US tariff risks. Adding to the positives is the recent flurry of trade agreements, including the “mother of all deals” with the EU, which strengthens India’s medium-term growth outlook. Most importantly, the recent market correction has brought valuations to far more attractive levels. This valuation comfort, combined with policy support, sets the stage for a potential rebound in the market. Accordingly, we have identified a set of stocks that have borne the brunt of the sell-off. These fundamentally strong names are well placed for a swift rebound as sentiment improves, and are also relatively well protected on the downside should the market weakness persists. The turnaround in the micro-finance cycle should drive a rebound in Muthoot Microfin’s loan growth and lower credit costs.

This marks a discount of 9.19 percent over the IPO price of Rs 124 apiece. The company debuted with a market capitalisation of Rs 6,509.78 crore. After the weak market debut, the stock dropped another 3 percent to close at Rs 109.18 apiece on its debut day. The stock is currently around 12 percent lower than its IPO price, and has a market capitalisation of Rs 6,312.06 crore.. Listing performance vs grey market estimates: The listing has missed grey market expectations. Ahead of listing, the unlisted shares of Shadowfax Technologies were trading with a grey market discount o 2.82 percent over the IPO price at Rs 120.5 apiece. The grey market estimates quoted by the site has significantly fallen from the 12.90 percent quoted on January 15. According to IPO Watch, the unlisted shares of the company were trading flat at the IPO price at Rs 124 apiece in the grey market. Shadowfax Tech IPO: The weak market debut comes despite the IPO of Shadowfax Technologies closing with 1.68 times subscription during its three days of public bidding between January 20 and January 22. Retail individual investors (RII) and qualified institutional buyers (QIB) had booked their respective reserved portion more than 2 times, while non-institutional investors (NII) subscribed 54 percent of their allotted quota. Bengaluru-based technology-led logistics solutions provider Shadowfax Tech moved to the primary capital market to raise Rs 1,907.2 crore through its initial public offering (IPO), which comprised a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 1,000 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of shares worth Rs 907.2 crore by several investors including Flipkart, Eight Roads Investments, Qualcomm, and NewQuest Asia Fund. The price band for the IPO was set at Rs 118-124 per share. Investors could bid for a minimum of 120 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,160, and in multiples thereafter. How will the IPO proceeds be used? The company proposes to utilise proceeds from the fresh issue towards funding enhancing capacity in terms of network infrastructure, funding of lease payments for new first mile, last mile, and sort centres, as well as towards branding, marketing, and communication initiatives, unidentified inorganic acquisitions, and general corporate purposes. Shadowfax IPO anchor book: A day before the IPO opened for public bidding, Shadowfax announced that it has raised Rs 856.02 crore from 39 anchor investors on January 19. ""Out of the total allocation, 3.67 crore equity shares worth Rs 455.73 crore were allocated to nine domestic mutual funds including ICICI Prudential AMC, Nippon Life India, Motilal Oswal AMC, Bandhan Mutual Fund, HSBC MF, Helios MF, JM Financial MF, and Trust Mutual Fund,"" Shadowfax Technologies in its filing to exchanges said. ICICI Prudential AMC was the largest investor in the anchor book, acquiring 1.53 crore equity shares for Rs 190 crore through its four schemes - ICICI Prudential Flexicap Fund, ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage Fund, ICICI Prudential Transportation and Logistics Fund, and ICICI Prudential Exports and Services Fund. Should you buy, sell or hold? Shadowfax is a technology-driven, asset-light logistics company focused on last-mile delivery, express parcels, reverse logistics and quick commerce services, said Mahesh M. Ojha, VP Research and Business Development at Kantilal Chhaganlal Securities. The company operates across more than 2,300 cities and 14,700 PIN codes and serves clients such as Flipkart, Meesho, Swiggy, Blinkit and Nykaa. The analyst highlighted that the IPO valuation appears relatively rich, when compared to peers like Delhivery. The business also faces intense competition and customer concentration risks, with a significant portion of revenue coming from a small number of large clients. According to him, the stock may be suitable for high-risk investors given the overall positive industry outlook. Investors with a long-term perspective who have already applied may consider holding the stock, while short-term investors could look to book gains on listing, if any. Fresh investors may wait for price discovery after listing. Gaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk, noted that Shadowfax offers a compelling play on India’s rapidly growing e-commerce and quick-commerce ecosystem. ""With pan-India reach across over 14,700 pincodes and a client roster that includes Flipkart, Meesho, Swiggy, Zomato, and Blinkit, the company has demonstrated strong revenue growth (~32% CAGR FY23–25) and operational scalability through its large gig-based delivery network. Its asset-light model and EBITDA-positive performance since FY24 highlight its improving profitability trajectory,"" the analyst said. He however cautioned that investors should be mindful of the risks and structural constraints. ""Margins remain thin, ROE and ROCE are modest, and revenue is concentrated with its top client contributing around 50%. At the upper price band, the IPO implies an EV/EBITDA of ~106x, which is rich compared with peers, suggesting that current valuations already reflect significant growth expectations,"" he said. Overall, Shadowfax offers long-term exposure to India’s logistics and hyperlocal delivery sector, but the IPO is better suited for investors with a long-term horizon, who are comfortable tracking execution, client diversification, and margin expansion over time, the analyst said. He added that for short-term listing gains, the risk-reward appears balanced but neutral.

Asian currencies gain as dollar weakens before Fed,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-currencies-gain-as-dollar-weakens-before-fed-13793459.html,"Asian currencies gained as the dollar sank to levels last seen four years ago as investors turned cautious toward the world’s reserve currency amid unpredictable policymaking from Washington. The Malaysian ringgit, Thai baht and the South Korean won all appreciated in early Asian trading after the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index slid to its lowest since February 2022 during the US session. The dollar steadied after its biggest fall since April. The greenback’s decline had accelerated after President Donald Trump said he was not concerned about the weakening. Asian stocks were mixed with South Korea rising and Japan falling. US equity-index futures extended gains as the Wall Street Journal reported SoftBank is in talks to invest up to $30 billion more in OpenAI. The dollar’s weakness reflects uncertainty over policy from the Trump administration, including threats to take over Greenland and comments that have raised concerns about the Federal Reserve’s independence. That forms the backdrop as the Fed announces its interest-rate decision Wednesday, just as traders turn their attention to megacap technology earnings. “The Trump administration is taking a calculated risk,” said Win Thin, chief economist at Bank of Nassau 1982 Ltd. “Foreign exchange typically is the leader in terms of showing market discomfort with a country’s policies and economic outlook, so this dollar weakness bears watching.” The latest decline in the dollar also follows signs of US support to boost the yen, reopening speculation around the potential for coordinated currency intervention to guide the greenback lower against key trading partners. Reports from traders Friday indicated that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York contacted financial institutions to check on the yen’s exchange rate — a preliminary step that’s often taken before interventions. Meanwhile, Trump’s dollar comments added to an earlier slide in the greenback, which reflected a lack of confidence in the US economy partly due to his erratic tariff policy. Speaking to reporters in Iowa, Trump said “the dollar is doing great.” When asked if he wants to see the currency decline more, he replied that he could have it go up or down “like a yo-yo.” In other corners of the market, gold traded slightly below its record high and silver advanced. West Texas Intermediate crude also edged up. The commodities are all priced in dollars. Treasuries were a touch stronger with the yield on the 10-year falling one basis point to 4.23% ahead of Wednesday’s Fed meeting. The central bank is projected to halt its rate-cutting cycle as a steadier jobs market restores a degree of consensus among officials after months of growing division. With the economy still displaying exceptional strength, the Fed’s messaging is likely to emphasize a data‑driven approach to future policy decisions, according to Chris Brigati at SWBC. Also, the tone from this week’s earnings from the so-called ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech companies should be solid. Around a third of S&P 500 companies by market capitalization report results this week.

Budget 2026: Capital gains tax fears rattle markets as weak sentiment amplifies risk,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/budget-2026-capital-gains-tax-fears-rattle-markets-as-weak-sentiment-amplifies-risk-13793450.html,"As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, investors are growing increasingly nervous about the possibility of further changes to capital gains taxation at a time when equity markets are already fragile. The concern is not driven by any formal proposal, but by the broader market context: volatile equities, sustained foreign investor selling and lingering unease after tax hikes introduced in 2024. Market participants say even the perception that equity taxation could be pushed closer to marginal income tax rates is amplifying anxiety. The fear is less about a headline hike and more about structural shifts that could quietly alter behaviour. These include aligning equity gains with income-tax slabs, frequent changes to holding periods, or raising the burden on short-term trades without reviewing the securities transaction tax. This debate is unfolding against an already layered tax framework, where investors face capital gains tax, STT and currency depreciation pressures at the same time. 2024 Changes Still Casting a Shadow Budget 2024 raised long-term capital gains tax to 12.5 percent, removed indexation benefits for new investments and increased short-term capital gains tax to 20 percent. While markets initially absorbed the changes during a strong rally, corrections later in the year dragged sentiment lower and kept the Nifty largely range-bound through 2025. “When long-term capital gains were raised from 10 percent to 12.5 percent in July 2024, foreign investors were unhappy,” said Tushar Sachde, tax partner at PwC. “Will the government change rates again within a year? The consensus is that it is unlikely.” Still, with 2026 beginning on a volatile note and foreign portfolio investors continuing to sell, investors are reassessing whether the higher tax burden is beginning to bite at the wrong point in the cycle. “Foreign investors look at post-tax returns,” Sachde said. “With higher taxes and the rupee moving closer to 92, they’ve effectively been hit on both counts.” Risk of Sell-Off if Taxes Rise Further Tejas Khoday, Co- founder & CEO, FYERS, said the current framework has already stretched market participants. “The system has overshot for active traders,” he said. “Any hike from here could trigger a sharp sell-off because it disincentivises equity investors to stay invested, especially when markets are not delivering returns.” Market participants stress the issue is not whether equities should be taxed. They already are. The concern is about direction. After successive changes, investors are trying to assess whether the government sees the current regime as settled or as a step toward treating capital gains more like regular income. “Frequent tinkering creates instability,” Khoday said. “What markets need is long-term predictability.” Layered Taxes Add to Pressure Satwik Jain of Generational Capital pointed to the cumulative impact of overlapping levies. “STT was introduced in lieu of long-term capital gains. Now you have both,” he said. “Add currency depreciation to that, and post-tax returns get squeezed. Even a directional signal like reducing STT would be taken very positively.” Market participants argue layered taxation combined with currency weakness is hurting risk appetite, particularly for foreign investors and active domestic traders. Government’s Fiscal Limits From the government’s perspective, capital gains remain an important revenue source. A large share of gains accrue to higher-income investors, strengthening the argument that passive income should not enjoy large tax advantages over salaries. At the same time, welfare commitments and infrastructure spending leave limited room for large concessions. “There is limited fiscal headroom,” said PwC’s Sachde. “Any relief has to be weighed against revenue considerations.” However, experts warn that aggressive tax tightening could be counterproductive at a time when markets are central to household financialisation, IPO funding and the government’s own divestment plans. Incremental Tweaks More Likely Most market participants expect incremental changes rather than sweeping reform. These could include a review of STT, rationalisation between short- and long-term rates or structural simplification without raising headline taxes. “STT is almost unique to India. It taxes participation, not profits,” Khoday said. “If you want to widen participation, you need to reduce STT and avoid raising capital gains further.” There is also a growing call for policy stability. “Taxation has become a key issue for foreign investors,” Khoday said. “Most countries don’t tax portfolio investors the way India does. Any further increase becomes a deterrent when post-tax returns are already under pressure.” Trivesh D of Tradejini said even partial relief could help sentiment. “Simplification rather than tightening should be the focus. Reducing STT or easing short-term capital gains could improve risk appetite without distorting long-term investment behaviour.” Markets may have absorbed the 2024 changes, but patience is thinning. What investors want ahead of Budget 2026 is clarity, stability and fewer negative surprises.","As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, investors are growing increasingly nervous about the possibility of further changes to capital gains taxation at a time when equity markets are already fragile.","The consensus is that it is unlikely.” Still, with 2026 beginning on a volatile note and foreign portfolio investors continuing to sell, investors are reassessing whether the higher tax burden is beginning to bite at the wrong point in the cycle.","Even a directional signal like reducing STT would be taken very positively.” Market participants argue layered taxation combined with currency weakness is hurting risk appetite, particularly for foreign investors and active domestic traders.","The consensus is that it is unlikely.” Still, with 2026 beginning on a volatile note and foreign portfolio investors continuing to sell, investors are reassessing whether the higher tax burden is beginning to bite at the wrong point in the cycle.",negative,0.9016314744949341
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade LIC, Indian Hotels, Asahi India Glass, JSW Steel, MCX India, and others on January 28?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-lic-indian-hotels-asahi-india-glass-jsw-steel-mcx-india-and-others-on-january-28-13793413.html,"The benchmark indices recouped some of the previous day’s losses, with the Nifty 50 rising half a percent on January 27, but market breadth remained weak. A total of 1,622 shares were under pressure compared to 1,311 shares that gained on the NSE. The market is expected to remain range-bound amid a rising India VIX. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities Indian Hotels Company | CMP: Rs 651.35 After the short-term correction in Indian Hotels from higher levels, the downward momentum has stalled and the stock has entered a consolidation phase over the past few sessions. Moreover, the stock is available near its important demand zone. The structure suggests a revival of the uptrend from the current levels in the near future. For traders, Rs 625 would be the key support level to watch. Above this, the uptrend structure could continue towards Rs 695. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 695 Stop-Loss: Rs 625 Tech Mahindra | CMP: Rs 1,745.1 On the weekly charts, Tech Mahindra is in a rising channel chart formation with a higher-high and higher-low series pattern. The stock has witnessed a steady recovery from trendline support levels. Additionally, the technical indicator RSI is indicating a further uptrend from the current levels, which could boost bullish momentum in the near future. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,680 could be the trend-decider level for the bulls. If the stock sustains above this level, a further uptrend towards Rs 1,870 can be expected. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,870 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,680 Life Insurance Corporation of India | CMP: Rs 807.8 On a broader timeframe, LIC has been in a prolonged downtrend and is currently in oversold territory. The texture of the chart formation and the technical indicator RSI indicate that the stock is very likely to rebound for a new leg of the upward move from its lower levels. For positional traders, Rs 780 would be the decisive level. Trading above this level, the uptrend formation will continue towards Rs 860. However, if the stock closes below Rs 780, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 860 Stop-Loss: Rs 780 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Asahi India Glass | CMP: Rs 991.9 On the daily chart, Asahi India Glass has been consistently protecting the prior day’s low on a closing basis over the past four trading sessions, indicating strong buying interest emerging from lower levels. Additionally, prices have closed above the mid-Bollinger Bands, suggesting a shift in short-term momentum. With follow-up buying, a move towards the upper Bollinger Bands near the Rs 1,030 zone is expected. Along with this, the MACD has shown a bullish crossover below the zero line, reinforcing the positive outlook for the stock. For now, a sustained break above Rs 1,000 can extend the rise further towards Rs 1,030, followed by Rs 1,065 levels, while immediate support is placed around the Rs 960 level. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,030, Rs 1,065 Stop-Loss: Rs 960 JSW Steel | CMP: Rs 1,222 On the daily chart, JSW Steel has been trading in a broad consolidation range between Rs 1,150 and Rs 1,202 since early January 2026, indicating a phase of accumulation. In the previous session, the stock surged over 4 percent and decisively broke out of this range, also making a fresh record high near the Rs 1,230 level with a sharp rise in volumes, which is a strong bullish signal. Additionally, prices recently found support at the 20-day Exponential Moving Average and bounced higher, confirming improving momentum. For now, a buy-on-dips strategy can be adopted for upside targets of Rs 1,280–1,300 levels. On the downside, Rs 1,170, which is an EMA support, should remain protected. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,280, Rs 1,300 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,170 Aditya Thukral, Founder & Analyst of AT Research & Risk Managers Multi Commodity Exchange of India | CMP: Rs 2,418 A falling trendline breakout has been witnessed in MCX with rising volumes. The stock is consistently trading above all its major exponential moving averages, namely the 20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day EMAs. An imminent uptrend has been established with the formation of higher highs and higher lows across all timeframes. Now that prices are trading above the short-term resistance of Rs 2,400, an uptrend continuation can be expected. Any minor dip towards the support at Rs 2,400 should be considered a buying opportunity, as previous resistance has turned into support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,550 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,299 Infosys | CMP: Rs 1,682.7 Infosys has been consolidating within a box pattern formed since December 22, 2025. Now that corrections in the stock are shrinking and an uptrend in prices is still very fresh, a breakout above the resistance at Rs 1,694 could provide a decent upward move. The stock is consistently trading above all its major exponential moving averages—20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day—with all the EMAs sloping upwards. A breakout above Rs 1,694 would be a continuation of the established uptrend and would provide an opportunity for fresh long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,765 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,660","Additionally, the technical indicator RSI is indicating a further uptrend from the current levels, which could boost bullish momentum in the near future.","Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 860 Stop-Loss: Rs 780 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Asahi India Glass | CMP: Rs 991.9 On the daily chart, Asahi India Glass has been consistently protecting the prior day’s low on a closing basis over the past four trading sessions, indicating strong buying interest emerging from lower levels.","Now that prices are trading above the short-term resistance of Rs 2,400, an uptrend continuation can be expected.","Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,030, Rs 1,065 Stop-Loss: Rs 960 JSW Steel | CMP: Rs 1,222 On the daily chart, JSW Steel has been trading in a broad consolidation range between Rs 1,150 and Rs 1,202 since early January 2026, indicating a phase of accumulation.",positive,0.8311766386032104

JSW Steel shares jump 5% after net profit surges 198% to Rs 717 crore: Here's what brokerages say,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jsw-steel-shares-jump-5-after-net-profit-surges-198-to-rs-717-crore-here-s-what-brokerages-say-13792738.html,"The shares of JSW Steel jumped around 5 percent on January 27 after the company released its results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. Brokerages remain bullish, with target prices implying strong upside potential from current levels. The shares of the steel maker closed at Rs 1,223.20 apiece on Tuesday. Earlier during the day, the stock jumped further to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 1,230.40 apiece. JSW Steel Q3 Results: JSW Steel reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 2,139 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 198 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from Rs 717 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. The firm's revenue from operations rose 11 percent YoY to Rs 45,991 crore during the quarter under review. The company’s steel sales grew 14 percent YoY to Rs 7.64 mt, while crude steel production rose 6 percent YoY to 7.48 mt. Motilal Oswal on JSW Steel: Motilal Oswal said the company’s revenue was in-line with estimates, mainly on account of strong volume, which was partially offset by muted NSR. “Adjusted EBITDA was largely in line with our estimate at INR66b (+19% YoY). It dipped 16% QoQ, mainly due to weak NSR and increased input costs,” it added. JSTL reported a decent performance in 3QFY26, supported by volume growth, offsetting muted steel prices. We believe JSTL is well-placed with new capacities coming on-stream, strong domestic demand, and a rising share of value-added proportion in the sales mix. Its focus on increasing the captive share of iron ore and improving coal linkages will support earnings, the domestic brokerage said. Motilal estimates double-digit revenue growth over FY26-FY28, driven by the ramp-up of new capacity and price recovery led by safeguard duty. The brokerage reiterated its ‘Buy’ rating for the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,350 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 15 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. PL Capital on JSW Steel: PL Capital upgraded the shares of JSW Steel to ‘Accumulate’ with a target price of Rs 1,292 apiece.

Click to View More Outlook for January 28 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities On monthly expiry, Nifty experienced a choppy session for the major part of the day before last hour short covering surge. The 25,190–25,200 zone, which acted as a support in the previous session, acted as a strong resistance for the major part of the session before Index managed to close higher. On the daily chart, Nifty formed a sizeable bullish candle with long lower wicks, indicating buying interest at lower levels. Notably, the index has managed to close above the 200-day EMA zone. Going ahead, the key support for Nifty is placed in the 24,950–24,900 zone, which coincides with the upward-sloping trendline, drawn by connecting the swing lows of 24,338 (8th August) and 24,405 (29th August). A decisive breakdown below this zone could result in Nifty extending its weakness towards 24,700, followed by 24,500 in the near term. On the upside, the 25,250–25,300 zone is expected to act as a strong resistance area, limiting any pullback attempts. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The NSE monthly expiry day proved to be a roller-coaster session for the market, as the Nifty witnessed a 300-point swing during the day. On closing, the index ended above the 200-DMA; however, a follow-up move is required before changing the bearish view on the Nifty. Support remains at 24,900, and a slip below this level could unlock fresh selling pressure from the bears. On the higher end, 25,500 continues to be a crucial resistance zone. Until the Nifty decisively breaks above 25,500, a sell-on-rise strategy may continue to work in the market.

India-EU FTA: Should you buy Indian auto stocks as tariffs on EU-made cars to be slashed to 10%? Here's what analysts say,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/india-eu-fta-should-you-buy-indian-auto-stocks-as-tariffs-on-eu-made-cars-to-be-slashed-to-10-here-s-what-analysts-say-13792378.html,"The shares of automakers dropped in trade on January 27, after the India and European Union finalized their much-awaited free trade agreement (FTA). Analysts have commented on what lies ahead for the Indian automakers. India will gradually cut tariffs on cars from 110 percent to as low as 10 percent as part of its new FTA with EU, and fully abolish duties on car parts within five to ten years, the European Commission said in a statement. Currently, the import duty levied by India on completely built-up (CBU) passenger vehicles is 110 percent for cars costing over $40,000, and 70 percent for cars costing up to $40,000. Indian automakers have long opposed such cuts, arguing that they would discourage investment in local production by making imported vehicles more competitive. Should you buy Indian auto stocks? The India-EU FTA will provide EU carmakers greater access to Indian PV market, which is the third largest globally in terms of volume just behind US and China, PL Capital said. The domestic brokerage noted that luxury vehicles comprise approximately 1 percent of the Indian market, therefore the tariff reduction should not impact the mass market players like Maruti Suzuki and entry-to-mid-level vehicles from Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles (TMPV) and Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M). However, it added that the tariff reduction may impact premium plus cars from these players to a small extent. “Tariff reduction on BEVs from 100% is expected to be applicable after 5 years in a phased manner, giving the likes of TMPV and M&M some relief. This India-EU FTA, which has been under negotiation for long,” PL Capital said. The immediate concern for equities is not the long-term competitiveness narrative, but near-term uncertainty around pricing, demand elasticity, and margin protection, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head, INVasset PMS. “Markets are reacting ahead of operational clarity, which explains the visible churn in auto counters despite the absence of any immediate earnings impact,” he said. For investors, the analyst said that the key variables to track are premium-segment exposure, pricing discipline, localisation depth, and export optionality. “Companies with a strong SUV mix, diversified geographic revenues, and robust balance sheets are better positioned to absorb competitive pressure. In the near term, volatility in auto stocks reflects positioning and sentiment, not a structural reset of the industry’s earnings trajectory,” he added. ""There is a strong and positive signal of confidence in India’s long term growth story. India today is not just a large market, but a future ready economy backed by reforms and policies focused on building a globally competitive ecosystem. The India EU Free Trade Agreement would be a historic milestone benefiting both sides by expanding trade and enabling deeper exchange of technology and innovation,"" said Hardeep Singh Brar, President and CEO, BMW Group India.

The company had posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 282 crore in the October-December quarter a year ago, according to a regulatory filing from TCPL, the Tata group's FMCG arm. However, the bottom line was hit by a one-time charge of Rs 22.86 crore tied to the recently enacted labour code.

India Cements shares meanwhile jumped nearly 5 percent on Tuesday. JSW Energy Q3 Results: JSW Energy shares dropped to Rs 432.8 apiece, the lowest level seen by the stock since February 19 last year. This came after the company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 419.94 crore, marking a 150 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from Rs 167.83 crore net profit reported in the same quarter of the previous financial year. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile grew more than 67 percent YoY to Rs 4,081 76 crore during the quarter under review. JM Financial said that the firm’s results marked an “all-round miss”, with debt and execution remaining the pain points. It noted that the company’s management expressed concerns about transmission connectivity beyond 2027, which is a potential risk for aggressive RE expansion. “The company also has 29.6GWh of locked-in energy storage capacity (26.4GWh pumped hydro, 3.2GWh BESS). We cut down our FY28 EBITDA (-17%) and PAT (-52%) estimates factoring moderation in new RE capacity additions and rising interest expenses,” it said. The domestic brokerage however estimates gradual improvement in key performance parameters as JSW Energy progresses in its vision of 30 GW by 2030; Net Debt/EBITDA (6.2x in FY25 to 5.8x in FY30), Gross block/MW (INR 46.7mn/MW in FY25 to INR 69.3mn/MW in FY30) and RoE (6.0% in FY26E to 7.4% by FY30). JM Financial reduced its target price for the stock to Rs 614 apiece, implying an upside potential of 28.5 percent from the previous closing price, while maintaining its ‘Buy’ rating. Motilal Financial Services also noted that the firm’s Q3 revenue missed its estimates primarily due to weaker than expected generation at Ratnagiri, Barmer and KSK Mahanadi plants. It reiterated its ‘Buy’ view on the stock, with a target price of Rs 590 apiece, implying an upside potential of 24 percent. Godrej Consumer Products Q3 Results: Godrej Consumer Products shares dropped to Rs 1,117.10 apiece on Tuesday, the lowest level seen by the stock since early December last year. The company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 498 crore, marking a marginal decline from the same period last year. The firm's revenue from operations meanwhile rose 9% YoY to Rs 4,099.12 crore. JM Financial downgraded the stock to ‘Add’ from ‘Buy’, with a target price of Rs 1,355 apiece. This implies an upside potential of 9 percent over the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage said that on the profitability front, gross margin may not materially change considering the shift in product mix, and improvement in EBITDA margin will be led by savings in media and other overheads. “Post the recent run-up (+12% in past 1 month) in stock price, NTM valuation of c.51x is closer to the long-term average and limits the upside,” it added. “In India, we see GCPL logging a high single-digit revenue growth, supported by new actions (favorable season for Household Insecticides likely to aid double-digit growth). We believe India OPM will see gradual expansion, to the higher-end of the normative margin band of 24-26% by FY28E, aiding high-teens EBITDA growth over FY26-28E. Indonesia is likely to be a drag – we see gradual recovery in performance. Africa cluster is likely to see sales growth momentum slowing to a high single-digit, while EBITDA growth is likely to log at a low double digit,” said Emkay Global. The India Cements Q3 Results: The India Cements shares rose to Rs 452.70 apiece, after seeing some decline during the previous session following the release of its Q3 results. The Chennai-headquartered cement maker posted a standalone net loss of Rs 5.72 crore in Q3 FY26, compared to a net loss of Rs 409.38 crore a year earlier. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile gained around 23.5 percent YoY to Rs 1,114.13 crore. Motilal Oswal says India Cements is witnessing operational improvement under UltraTech's leadership with recovery in margins and steady improvement in capacity utilization. The brokerage expects the company’s revenue CAGR at 11 percent over FY25-28, led by a volume/realization CAGR of ~9%/2%.

UltraTech Cement Q3 Results: UltraTech Cement on January 24 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,725.40 crore attributable to the firm’s owners for the third quarter of the ongoing financial year 2025. This marks a 27 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from the Rs 1,359.43 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. Notably, the net profit reported during the quarter included an exceptional item of Rs 88.48 crore due to the one-time impact of the New Labour Codes which took effect from November 21. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile grew around 23 percent YoY to Rs 21,829.68 crore in Q3 FY26, from Rs 17,778.83 crore in Q3 FY25.

JM Financial on UltraTech Cement: JM Financial said that UltraTech Cement reported a strong Q3 FY26 earnings performance with consolidated EBITDA rising 35 percent YoY to Rs 3,920 crore, beating its estimates primarily due to lower-than-estimated cost/tn. “Management highlighted robust demand momentum is likely to sustain supported by infra projects. The industry has taken price hikes in Jan’26 and anticipates further price hike likely supported by improving demand. We argue UltraTech is poised for structural improvement in return ratios over the next three–four years owing to: i) rising asset turnover; ii) low cost of expansion; and iii) improving profitability. Factoring in the 3Q performance and improving demand/pricing, we are increasing EBITDA by 6% for FY26E and 1–3% for FY27E–28E,” the brokerage said.

"Kotak Mahindra Bank shares tumble 5% after Q3 results miss estimates: Should you buy, sell or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/kotak-mahindra-bank-shares-tumble-5-after-q3-results-miss-estimates-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13791546.html,"The shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank tumbled more than 5 percent on January 27 after the company released its results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. Brokerages have mixed views for the stock, with some cutting forecasts after the lender’s earnings missed estimates. The shares of the heavyweight lender dropped to Rs 400.5 apiece, recording the sharpest single-day fall since July 2025. Kotak Mahindra Q3 Results: Kotak Mahindra Bank on January 24 reported a standalone net profit of Rs 3,446.14 crore for Q3 FY26. This marks a 4 percent year-on-year increase from the Rs 3,305 crore net profit reported in the same quarter of the previous financial year. The bank's results missed estimates, as analysts had expected a profit of Rs 3,572 crore, according to data compiled by LSEG. Net Interest Income (NII) increased more than 5 percent YoY to Rs 7,565 crore during the quarter under review, from Rs 7,196 crore a year ago. However, net interest margin (NIM) declined to 4.54 percent from 4.93 percent in the third quarter of the previous financial year. Asset quality slightly improved sequentially, with gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio moderating to 1.30 percent as on December 31, 2025, from 1.50 percent a year ago. Net NPA also eased to 0.31 per cent from 0.41 per cent at the end of December 2024. HDFC Securities on Kotak Mahindra Bank: HDFC Securities noted that Kotak Mahindra Bank’s Q3 earnings were below estimates, as flattish margins, soft traction in fee income, and relatively high opex intensity was partly offset by higher growth on both sides of the balance sheet. “Healthy loan growth (16% YoY) was driven by mortgages, business banking, SME segments. Deposit growth (~14% YoY) was strong with CASA ratio at 41.3% (-101bps QoQ) and softer than usual traction in CA balances. While the stress in unsecured segments has largely abated, stress in retail CV segment remains elevated. We are constructive on KMB, expecting growth momentum to sustain in RoA-accretive segments such as LAP, CV/CE, tractors, business banking, and SME, concomitantly reshaping its unsecured segment strategy,” the domestic brokerage said. It cut the lender’s FY26E/FY27E earnings forecasts by 5/2 percent, factoring in softer margins and fee income. It maintained its ‘Buy’ rating for the stock, with a target price of Rs 495 apiece, implying an upside potential of more than 17 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. While growth is picking up, higher opex was seen after four quarters of managing it well, noted CLSA. Emkay meanwhile expects Kotak Mahindra Bank to report a relatively moderate RoA of 1.9 percent in FY26E, albeit with an improvement to 2 percent in FY27/FY28E as margins and loss -loss provisions normalize Motilal Oswal on Kotak Mahindra Bank: Motilal Oswal said the lender’s NII and other income stood largely in line with its estimates. Operating expenses came in higher than anticipated, while provisions were lower than estimates. “The decline in the unsecured portfolio has now been arrested, and the bank has reiterated its guidance for stronger growth in the coming quarters, which should also support margins. Overall loan growth is guided at 1.5-2.0x nominal GDP, driven by stable momentum in retail and unsecured segments. Given the continued growth traction, we believe the bank is well positioned to deliver a healthy ~16% loan CAGR over FY26-28E,” the domestic brokerage said. Motilal maintained its earnings estimate, along with a ‘Buy’ call on the stock with a target price of Rs 500 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 18 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. Kotak Mahindra Bank share price: Kotak Mahindra Bank shares have fallen more than 5 percent in the past one month, but gained around 4 percent in the past six months. The stock which currently has a P/E ratio of 22.50, is currently the top loser on benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty, as well as the Nifty Bank index.

The recovery in Adani group stocks today follows a steep selloff in the previous session triggered by US regulatory developments. Adani Enterprises shares rose nearly 5 percent to around Rs 1,955, while Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone gained over 4 percent to Rs 1,363, placing both stocks among the top of the Nifty gainers’ list in morning trade. The rebound follows a sharp decline on Friday, January 23, when Adani group stocks fell as much as 14 percent amid reports that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had sought court permission to serve legal summons on billionaire Gautam Adani and group executive Sagar Adani. Other Adani group stocks also traded higher on Tuesday. Adani Green Energy advanced nearly 4 percent to about Rs 802, Adani Energy Solutions rose close to 4 percent to around Rs 844, and Adani Power was up over 2 percent at roughly Rs 136. Earlier, on January 23, Adani Enterprises had closed nearly 11 percent lower, its lowest level since May 19, 2023. Adani Green Energy stock had slumped more than 14 percent, while Adani Ports had ended the session down about 7 percent. Adani Energy Solutions had fallen 10 percent, marking its biggest single-day percentage drop since November 21, 2024. The selloff was sparked by reports that the SEC had asked a US court for permission to directly email summons to Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani in connection with an alleged fraud and a USD 265 million bribery scheme. According to Reuters, the SEC told the court that it did not expect service to be completed through existing channels after India declined two earlier requests to serve the summons. Adani Group has rejected the allegations, calling them “baseless”, and has said it would pursue “all possible legal recourse”. In June, Gautam Adani had stated that “despite all the noise”, no one from the Adani Group had been charged with violating the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or conspiring to obstruct justice. Separately, Adani Enterprises informed stock exchanges that it is not a party to the legal proceedings referenced in recent media reports and that the matter does not trigger any disclosure requirements under India’s listing regulations. Responding to queries from BSE and NSE following a media report, the company said there are “no allegations made against the Company” and that it is not involved in the proceedings cited. It added that the reported developments do not have any bearing on its disclosure or compliance obligations under SEBI regulations.

Silver ETFs also mirrored the sharp surge in the precious metals. Hindustan Zinc shares hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 733 apiece in the early trading hours of Tuesday. The Vedanta Group-company is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity. Silver prices soar to fresh lifetime highs: Silver futures on MCX with March expiry jumped more than 7 percent to hit a fresh lifetime high of Rs 3,59,800 per kilogram. The future contracts with May and July expiries also surged to new all-time highs of Rs 3,75,261 per kg and Rs 3,82,940 per kg, respectively. Spot silver surged 5.2 percent to $109.22 an ounce, after hitting a record high of $117.69 ​on Monday. The white metal has already surged 53% ‍so far this year. ""Trump's disruptive policy approach this year is playing into the hands of ​precious metals as a defensive play. The threats of higher tariffs to Canada and South Korea are doing enough to keep gold a safe-haven choice,"" said Reuters quoted Tim Waterer, KCM Trade's chief market ‍analyst, as saying. US President Donald Trump on Monday said he would raise tariffs on South Korean autos, lumber, and pharmaceuticals imports to 25 percent, criticizing Seoul for failing to enact a trade deal with Washington. This came after he threatened tariffs on Canada. The tariff flip-flops have significantly boosted the precious metals. Silver ETFs: Silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) saw significant surge today, as the precious and industrial metal soared. Nippon India Silver ETF (Silverbees) jumped nearly 10 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 321.48 apiece. Groww Silver ETF also gained around 10 percent. Zerodha Silver ETF gained more than 11 percent to a new record high of Rs 34.7 apiece. HDFC Silver ETF meanwhile surged more than 12 percent. UTI Silver ETF, Aditya Birla Sun Life Silver ETF, Tata Silver ETF, ICICI Pru Silver ETF, DSP Silver ETF, Motilal Oswal Silver ETF, Axis Silver ETF and others also gained sharply. Should you buy silver ETFs at these levels? For those looking at fresh investment, the main risk right now is valuation and sentiment, said Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead at VT Markets. He added that silver is far more volatile than gold, and sharp rallies are often followed by equally sharp corrections once speculative interest cools. ""Entering at current highs could expose new investors to near-term drawdowns if prices consolidate or retrace sharply. A better approach for those who still want exposure is to use dollar cost averaging strategies, entering in small, staggered allocations that average out entry costs and reduce timing risk,"" he said. For investors planning to exit their positions, Maxwell said that if silver was added as a tactical hedge or short-term trade, then this is a sensible area to book at least partial profits. ""Locking in gains and rebalancing back to target asset allocation helps protect against sudden reversals, which are common in precious metals,"" he said. However, investors with a longer-term view who believe in structural drivers like industrial demand and tight supply may choose to continue holding a core position, the expert added. ""This is not an ideal price for large fresh investments, and partial profit-taking for current holders is a rational risk-management move rather than a full exit,"" he explained.

"Axis Bank shares jump nearly 4% today after Q3 results, brokerages bullish; check target prices",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/axis-bank-shares-jump-nearly-4-today-after-q3-results-brokerages-bullish-check-target-prices-13791306.html,"Shares of Axis Bank Ltd jumped nearly 4 percent in early trade on Tuesday, January 27, after the private sector lender reported a better-than-expected results for Q3 FY26. The strong financial performance drew a string of bullish brokerage responses on earnings visibility, asset quality and valuations. Axis Bank stock was trading at Rs 1,306.6, up 3.86 percent, extending its strong run over the past year. The stock has gained 37.3 percent over the last 12 months, sharply outperforming the Nifty 50, which is up about 9.7 percent over the same period. Axis Bank Q3 results beat estimates Axis Bank reported a 3 percent year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 6,489.6 crore for Q3 FY26, beating the CNBC-TV18 poll estimate of Rs 6,046 crore. Net interest income grew 5 percent on-year to Rs 14,286.4 crore, also ahead of Street expectations, reflecting steady core lending performance. Asset quality improved sequentially, with gross NPAs easing to 1.40 percent from 1.46 percent in the September quarter and net NPAs declining to 0.42 percent from 0.44 percent. In absolute terms, gross NPAs fell quarter-on-quarter, while net NPAs edged up marginally. Axis Bank stock call: Brokerages turn more bullish Brokerages were largely positive on the stock outlook, citing improving credit cost visibility, resilient profitability metrics and attractive valuations. Citi upgraded Axis Bank to a ‘Buy’ and raised its target price to Rs 1,436, implying an upside of over 14 percent. Citi highlighted another core earnings beat and return on assets of around 1.5 percent. The brokerage flagged stable slippages despite agricultural seasonality, lower-than-expected credit costs and improved cost efficiency, even as treasury gains and fee income remained muted. CLSA maintained its ‘Outperform’ rating with a target price of Rs 1,500, calling asset quality the key highlight of the quarter. It noted that excluding technical slippages, gross slippages declined sharply on-year, driven by unsecured retail credit, while credit costs came in below estimates. Bernstein, which has an ‘Outperform’ rating and a target of Rs 1,480, described the quarter as mixed, with healthy loan and deposit growth offset by margin pressure and elevated credit costs. Still, it said return on assets was sustained at around 1.5 percent. Nomura reiterated its ‘Buy’ call with a target price of Rs 1,540, pointing to improving credit cost visibility and strengthening growth trends. The brokerage expects return on assets of 1.7-1.8 percent and return on equity of around 15 percent over FY27-28, with earnings CAGR estimated at 26 percent. HSBC also maintained a ‘Buy’ rating, setting a target price of Rs 1,580, and said the upgrade thesis was playing out as expected, supported by sharp improvement in credit costs and strong growth and margin performance. Jefferies retained its ‘Buy’ call with a target of Rs 1,550, citing a profit beat driven by stronger topline, lower credit costs and controlled operating expenses.

"Asian stocks dip on Korea tariffs, Yen holds gains",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-dip-on-korea-tariffs-yen-holds-gains-13790952.html,"Asian equities edged lower as tariff concerns resurfaced after President Donald Trump threatened to raise levies on South Korean goods. The yen held its gains. The Kospi Index, one of the world’s best-performing benchmarks this year, fell 0.9%, while the South Korean won weakened after four days of gains. Japanese shares fell for a second day, weighed down by a stronger yen. The yen traded near around 154 per dollar after gaining on the greenback over the past two sessions amid speculation the US may coordinate intervention with Japan. A gauge of the dollar was steady Tuesday, hovering around levels last seen in 2022. Gold and silver also traded near their record highs on Tuesday. While much of the market’s focus has been on currencies and the risk of yen intervention, tariff concerns have also resurfaced after Trump warned of 100% levies on Canada. The added uncertainty comes in a pivotal week for investors, with megacap technology earnings set to test whether the artificial-intelligence driven rally can be sustained. “Tech has become more of a show-me story,” said Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer for wealth and investment management at Wells Fargo, which manages $2.3 trillion. “If Big Tech can continue to deliver, I think capital will start flowing in tech’s direction again.” In the US, companies accounting for roughly a third of the S&P 500’s market capitalization report this week. The US president has ratcheted up trade tensions with several allies in recent weeks, threatening to raise duties on Canadian products to 100% if Ottawa signed a trade deal with China. Trump attributed a 25% tariff hike on South Korean goods to the country’s legislature failing to codify a trade agreement reached with the US last year. Trump had earlier threatened to slap new charges on European countries’ goods over his quest to seize control of Greenland. He then backed off. Meanwhile, the yen’s gains remained in focus after comments from Japanese officials fueled speculation that the government may intervene in the market to prevent the currency from resuming its slide. To some, however, the recent rally has partly neutralized the likelihood of intervention. “The dramatic recovery in the yen suggests that actual intervention is not needed,” said Marc Chandler at Bannockburn Capital Markets. Elsewhere, US power grids are under mounting pressure following a winter storm that unleashed deep cold and heavy snow and ice from Texas to Maine. That’s knocked an estimated 12% of US natural gas production off-line and forecasts for frigid weather caused prices to soar. US natural gas prices jumped around 30%. Treasuries remained in a narrow range on Monday with the Federal Reserve expected to pause its rate cuts when it announces its policy on Wednesday. Fed officials are expected to hold rates steady following three straight cuts at the end of 2025, as a steadier jobs market restores a degree of consensus at the central bank after months of growing division. Chair Jerome Powell is likely to telegraph his view that policy is well-positioned for now, but refrain from signaling much about where rates are headed. Expectations about Fed policy have been shifting in response to changes in the consensus view on whom Trump will nominate to succeed Powell, whose term expires in May. “Even though the Fed isn’t expected to cut interest rates, Powell’s press conference may be as much about Fed independence as it is policy,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.","While much of the market’s focus has been on currencies and the risk of yen intervention, tariff concerns have also resurfaced after Trump warned of 100% levies on Canada.","While much of the market’s focus has been on currencies and the risk of yen intervention, tariff concerns have also resurfaced after Trump warned of 100% levies on Canada.",Asian equities edged lower as tariff concerns resurfaced after President Donald Trump threatened to raise levies on South Korean goods.,"Meanwhile, the yen’s gains remained in focus after comments from Japanese officials fueled speculation that the government may intervene in the market to prevent the currency from resuming its slide.",negative,0.7166424989700317

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Hindustan Unilever, Shriram Finance, Union Bank of India, Tech Mahindra, Max Financial Services, and others on January 27?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-hindustan-unilever-shriram-finance-union-bank-of-india-tech-mahindra-max-financial-services-and-others-on-january-27-13790719.html,"Equity benchmarks slipped nearly 1 percent on January 23, with the Nifty 50 now trading below all key moving averages. Market breadth was favourable for bears, with about 2,233 shares declining against 702 advancing shares on the NSE. Consolidation with range-bound trading is expected to continue over the next few sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities Tech Mahindra | CMP: Rs 1,701.1 On the daily and weekly charts, Tech Mahindra is trending higher, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms, indicating a short- to medium-term uptrend. On the weekly chart, the stock has confirmed a down-sloping trendline breakout at the Rs 1,640 level along with huge volumes, indicating increased participation. The stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100- and 200-day SMA, which reconfirms the bullish trend. The daily, weekly and monthly strength RSI is in positive territory, signalling rising strength. The daily and weekly Bollinger Band signals indicate increased price movement. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,800, Rs 1,850 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,640 Bank of India | CMP: 159.65 On the weekly chart, Bank of India has confirmed a “multiple resistance” breakout at the Rs 154 level on a closing basis, along with huge volumes, which signifies bullish sentiment. The stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100- and 200-day SMA, and these averages are also inching up along with rising prices, which reconfirms a bullish trend. The weekly and monthly strength RSI is in positive territory, signalling rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 180, Rs 185 Stop-Loss: Rs 154 PG Electroplast | CMP: Rs 510.35 On the daily and weekly charts, PG Electroplast is in a downtrend, forming a series of lower tops and bottom formations. It has also decisively broken a 5–6 month up-sloping trendline on a closing basis, along with huge volumes, indicating selling pressure. The stock is sustaining below its 50-, 100- and 200-day SMAs, which reconfirms a short-term downtrend. The daily, weekly and monthly strength indicator RSI remains weak, indicating continued weakness in the recent downturn. Investors should consider exiting long positions as well as initiating fresh shorts in this stock. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 470, Rs 450 Stop-Loss: Rs 550 Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One Hindustan Unilever | CMP: Rs 2,409.50 While the benchmark index Nifty ended the week with a decline of around 2.5 percent, Hindustan Unilever acted as a defensive outperformer, gaining nearly 2 percent during the week and exhibiting strong relative strength. On the daily chart, prices are forming a bullish Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern and are placed above all major moving averages, which supports the buy view. Additionally, the smoothened RSI has generated a fresh buy signal, with a bullish crossover above its signal line on both the daily and weekly charts. Hence, we recommend buying Hindustan Unilever in the range of Rs 2,410–2,400. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,550 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,330 Max Financial Services | CMP: Rs 1,599 Max Financial Services has been trading in a range over the past three months and, after failing to cross the Rs 1,750 mark on two occasions, has now breached key support levels, confirming a topping-out formation in the form of a Double Top. Prices have also slipped below the crucial 89 DEMA, which earlier acted as support and now signals a change in polarity. On the indicator front, the RSI remains in the negative zone, further reinforcing the sell view. Hence, we recommend selling Max Financial Services around Rs 1,595. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 1,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,640 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments Shriram Finance | CMP: Rs 1,003.55 Shriram Finance is forming a classic pole-and-flag structure on the daily chart, with the flag marked by low-volume sideways consolidation between Rs 961 and Rs 1,025.6. The contraction reflects healthy digestion after a strong impulsive pole, not distribution. Institutional volumes during the pole were clearly accumulative, lending credibility to the continuation setup. A pre-emptive long around Rs 1,003 offers a front-running opportunity with a favourable risk–reward ratio ahead of confirmation. However, real momentum acceleration will only emerge on a decisive breakout above Rs 1,025. A sustained breach of this ceiling is likely to unleash sharp follow-through buying, projecting an initial upside toward the Rs 1,100 zone. Until then, the flag structure remains constructive, with dips likely to be absorbed rather than sold. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 960 Bank of Maharashtra | CMP: Rs 65.63 Bank of Maharashtra is on the verge of resolving a powerful 371-day rounding base, with a very shallow handle making it a textbook cup-and-handle structure. The base has seen clear institutional accumulation, while the right-side development shows tight price action with sharply dried-up volumes, signalling calm before expansion. This contraction reflects absorption, not supply. The breakout pivot is precisely placed at Rs 67.63, and a decisive breach with follow-through would confirm momentum ignition. Given the strength of the base, the move is likely to be fast and directional. On confirmation, the stock can propel toward the Rs 78–79 zone initially. With a pre-budget tailwind building across PSU banking names, the risk–reward favours an upside resolution, while failure to clear the pivot would only delay, not negate, the broader bullish structure. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 79 Stop-Loss: Rs 62 Union Bank of India | CMP: Rs 172.77 Union Bank of India has delivered a decisive breakout from a massive 2,002-day VCP (Volume Contraction Pattern) structure, marking a major long-term trend shift. Post breakout, the stock has paused into an eight-day tight flag, acting as a pit stop rather than exhaustion. This brief consolidation has allowed short-term indicators and momentum to cool off without damaging the structure. Moving averages across daily and weekly charts remain bullishly aligned and continue to act as a launchpad. The setup signals stored energy ahead of expansion. A clean breakout and sustain above Rs 176 would trigger the next momentum leg, opening an initial move toward Rs 189. Beyond that, the multi-year high near Rs 220 becomes the next logical zone where profit booking may emerge. Until then, the structure favours continuation over consolidation. Strategy: Buy Target; Rs 189, Rs 220 Stop-Loss: Rs 164","Until then, the structure favours continuation over consolidation.","Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,800, Rs 1,850 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,640 Bank of India | CMP: 159.65 On the weekly chart, Bank of India has confirmed a “multiple resistance” breakout at the Rs 154 level on a closing basis, along with huge volumes, which signifies bullish sentiment.","A sustained breach of this ceiling is likely to unleash sharp follow-through buying, projecting an initial upside toward the Rs 1,100 zone.","Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,550 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,330 Max Financial Services | CMP: Rs 1,599 Max Financial Services has been trading in a range over the past three months and, after failing to cross the Rs 1,750 mark on two occasions, has now breached key support levels, confirming a topping-out formation in the form of a Double Top.",negative,0.9147681593894958
Mining stocks in Asia gain as hard-asset trade gathers pace,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mining-stocks-in-asia-gain-as-hard-asset-trade-gathers-pace-13790369.html,"Asian mining stocks climbed with metals prices as investors rotated into hard assets, driven by a weakening dollar and growing unease over currencies, geopolitics and global fiscal risks. A group of materials producers led gains Monday on MSCI Inc.’s broadest index of Asia Pacific equities. Korea Zinc Co. shares climbed as much as 14% in Seoul while Zhongjin Gold Corp.’s jumped 10% in Shanghai. Markets were closed for holidays Monday in Australia and India. The advances mirror a powerful rally in metals markets, where gold, silver, copper and aluminum are climbing on what traders describe as a debasement trade. Investors are pulling away from currencies and Treasuries, seeking refuge in hard assets as concerns mount over fiscal largesse, geopolitics and the durability of US exceptionalism.

Broader indices log biggest weekly decline in 4 months; over 200 small-caps see double-digit losses,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/broader-indices-log-biggest-weekly-decline-in-4-months-over-200-small-caps-see-double-digit-losses-13789275.html,"Broader indices fell 4–6 percent, logging their biggest weekly decline in four months and underperforming the benchmark indices amid mixed earnings from India Inc, continued foreign investor outflows, and the rupee hitting a fresh low. The BSE Sensex declined 769.67 points, or 2.43 percent, to close at 81,537.70, while the Nifty50 shed 241.25 points, or 2.51 percent, to end at 25,048.65. So far this month, the BSE Sensex and Nifty50 have each declined 4 percent, while the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices have fallen 5.7 percent and 9 percent, respectively. All the sectoral indices gave negative return with Nifty Realty shed more than 11 percent, Nifty Consumer Durables index slipped 6.5 percent, Nifty Media plunged 4 percent, Nifty Oil & Gas, Energy, Infra, Defence, Healthcare fell 3 percent each. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) offloaded equities worth Rs 14,651.99 crore during the period, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) offset the selling with purchases worth Rs 20,746 crore. ""Indian equity markets remained cautious and volatile through the week, pressured by renewed global trade tensions and continued foreign investor outflows. Fresh U.S. tariff threats against European nations linked to the Greenland issue dampened global risk appetite, prompting a shift toward safe-haven assets. Moreover, rising global bond yields and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Supreme Court’s review of Trump-era tariffs further restrained risk-taking,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""Corporate earnings reinforced the mixed sentiment, as weaker results from leading banking and IT companies tempered market enthusiasm, although selective value buying offered intermittent support. While global cues briefly improved following constructive remarks from the U.S. President on the Greenland issue, the domestic market’s rebound was short-lived, highlighting the persistence of external headwinds for India."" ""Market direction in the coming week is likely to be driven by global macroeconomic signals and domestic fiscal expectations. Investors will closely track guidance from the Fed on the trajectory of interest rate cuts, while positioning may be influenced by anticipation surrounding the Union Budget, particularly any measures aimed at easing external trade pressures and supporting capital flows,"" Nair said. ""With the Q3 earnings season still underway, stock-specific movements are expected to remain prominent. Overall sentiment is likely to stay cautious, shaped by global developments, currency trends, and earnings outcomes, with selective opportunities emerging in segments supported by resilient domestic demand,"" he added.

Where is Nifty50 headed? Hitesh Tailor, Research Analyst, Choice Equity Broking The 81,000–81,100 zone is emerging as a crucial support area for the Sensex, acting as a cushion where dip-buying interest may surface if weakness deepens. On the upside, 82,000–82,100 stands as the immediate resistance band, where any short-term rebound is likely to encounter supply pressure and profit booking. With the index ending decisively below recent intermediate levels and broad-based selling dominating the session, the near-term bias remains cautious to bearish. Selective accumulation may be considered only if the key support zone holds and clear buying interest re-emerges."" Amol Athawale, VP – Technical Research We are of the view that as long as the market trades below the 100-day SMA or 25500/83000, the weak formation is likely to continue. On the downside, 24900/81100 would act as an immediate support zone. Below this level, selling pressure is likely to accelerate. Further below, the market could slip to 24700,–24,500/80500-80000. On the upside, above 25,200/82000, we could see a quick pullback up to 25,350–25,500/82500-83000. For Bank Nifty, 58,000 would act as a key level for traders. Below this, the correction wave is likely to continue until 57,500–57100. Conversely, above 59,000, it could bounce back up to 59,350–59,500.

All three Wall Street benchmarks had rebounded in the past two sessions following Tuesday's sharp selloff triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to impose tariffs on European allies, an effort to pressure them to accept his claims to Greenland. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 285.30 points, or 0.58%, to 49,098.71. The S&P 500 edged up 2.26 points, or 0.03%, to 6,915.61, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 65.23 points, or 0.28%, to 23,501.24. Even the Nasdaq's ‌Friday gains were not enough to rescue the benchmarks from having a down week, with the S&P 500 off by ​0.36%, the Dow lower by 0.53% and the Nasdaq slipping by 0.06%. Despite the week's limited pullback, investors appeared to remain confident that while geopolitical-induced volatility is a present danger, the overall state of the American economy continues to be robust. ""When we think about what it means from an investor's standpoint, we feel ‍pretty good about where we are today,"" said Jason Blackwell, chief investment strategist at Focus Partners Wealth. He noted that volatility was expected this year, given the midterms later in 2026. However, corporate earnings are expected to continue to come in strong, and the economy is going along fine. ""We're feeling pretty good, but mindful we might have some significant twists and ⁠turns throughout the rest of the year,"" Blackwell added. THE 'SHOW-ME' SEASON One twist on Friday, which weighed on market sentiment, was chipmaker Intel (INTC.O), opens new tab. Its shares sank 17% after the ‍company forecast quarterly revenue and profit below market estimates, saying it struggled to satisfy demand for its server chips used in AI data centers. With many technology and semiconductor companies ‌still trading ‌at sky-high valuations, 2026 is viewed by many as the year where the huge excitement for the artificial intelligence trend, and the huge amounts of capital expenditure to attain it, need to start showing up as corporate revenue. Julian McManus, portfolio manager on the Global Alpha Equity team at Janus Henderson, noted how last week's earnings from TSMC(2330.TW), opens new tab, the world's main producer of advanced AI chips, could portend well for the latest earnings from the space. “Going into results, we’re going to be ⁠in a ‘show-me’ period, where you have ⁠to actually put up the revenue ​growth to justify the run-up in stocks,” he said. “It’s going to be a period of the haves versus the have-nots, and I personally don’t see Intel being in the haves.” MAG 7 EARNINGS TEST This show-me point will be particularly pertinent for investors next week, with earnings on deck from many of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, including Apple, Tesla ‍and Microsoft. On Friday, most of the megacaps rose, with Microsoft, Meta and Amazon up between 1.7% and 3.3%. Nvidia gained 1.5% after Bloomberg News reported Chinese officials have told Alibaba, Tencent tab and ByteDance they can prepare orders for Nvidia's H200 AI chips. Of the S&P sub-sectors, seven ended in positive territory, led by the 0.9% increase in materials. The energy index rose 0.6% on Friday, ​to its third successive record closing high. It was also the top performing sub-index for the ‍week, while its 10.1% advance so far in 2026 is unmatched. The number of shares changing hands on U.S. exchanges on Friday was 17.34 billion shares, compared with the 17.07 billion average over ​the last 20 trading days.","“Going into results, we’re going to be ⁠in a ‘show-me’ period, where you have ⁠to actually put up the revenue ​growth to justify the run-up in stocks,” he said.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down ​on Friday, while the S&P 500 ended largely unchanged, as investors' risk appetite was dimmed at the end of a topsy-turvy week ‌by Intel's plunge on a downbeat outlook.","He noted that volatility was expected this year, given the midterms later in 2026.","“It’s going to be a period of the haves versus the have-nots, and I personally don’t see Intel being in the haves.” MAG 7 EARNINGS TEST This show-me point will be particularly pertinent for investors next week, with earnings on deck from many of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, including Apple, Tesla ‍and Microsoft.",neutral,0.6888764500617981

Eli Lilly manufactures and supplies the product, while Cipla manages marketing and distribution. Cipla is working on expanding the coverage beyond major cities, with pricing in line with Mounjaro. “Yurpeak is a massive opportunity for us,” Gupta said. “Since we believe that is the best‑in‑class product out there and is under patent for a long time, at the moment we’re focusing maximum energies on that.” In its first month (December 2025), the Yurpeak has recorded sales of Rs.14 crore, performing well in tier-2 and 3 markets. Cipla decision to go slow on semaglutide, contrast with rivals Dr.Reddy's and Sun Pharma, who got regulatory approval in India for launching generic versions of semaglutide. Both companies announced that they will be launching generic Ozempic in March, following the patent expiry of the drug. Analysts expect the generic would be cheaper by 50-60 percent than branded drug. US dragged by lenalidomide cliff, lanreotide supply issues The drugmaker posted a lacklustre performance in its US business due to a sharp drop in anti-cancer generic lenalidomide sales and supply disruptions in lanreotide. Cipla’s North America, which consists largely US, reported around 26% drop YoY to $167 million in Q3FY26, as lenalidomide contributions dwindled sharply and lanreotide supplies were disrupted after an USFDA audit hit its partner Pharmathen. Gupta acknowledged the drag openly. “We had a small contribution from lenalidomide in Q3, and lanreotide faced supply challenges following the USFDA audit of our partner,” he said. “In the meantime, the product will be in limited supplies… but we are working on enabling an alternate site together with the partner.” The supply issues will spill into next quarter as well, the company said. Gupta described US performance as a “temporary” setback that will be offset by upcoming high‑value launches, particularly in respiratory and peptides. “There are two respiratory assets where we believe we could have a sole‑generic opportunity, and these are pretty sizable,” he said. “Our pipeline gives us the confidence to offset lenalidomide and deliver strong growth.” Complex generics over volume play Cipla plans to lean further into complex, high‑margin launches — including long‑acting injectables and peptides — to rebuild momentum in the US. “We focus a lot on the value and complexity of launches rather than the number of filings,” Gupta said. “This will help us make up for the loss.” He reiterated that filgrastim in the US is a “small entry” and more of a capability‑building step in biosimilars.","US dragged by lenalidomide cliff, lanreotide supply issues The drugmaker posted a lacklustre performance in its US business due to a sharp drop in anti-cancer generic lenalidomide sales and supply disruptions in lanreotide.","Cipla Ltd. on Friday said it will take a “wait‑and‑watch” approach on entering the diabetes and weight loss therapy semaglutide market even as rivals prepare for generic launches, as the company prioritises its partnership with Eli Lilly for tirzepatide, which it considers the superior obesity and diabetes therapy.","Cipla’s North America, which consists largely US, reported around 26% drop YoY to $167 million in Q3FY26, as lenalidomide contributions dwindled sharply and lanreotide supplies were disrupted after an USFDA audit hit its partner Pharmathen.","“In the meantime, the product will be in limited supplies… but we are working on enabling an alternate site together with the partner.” The supply issues will spill into next quarter as well, the company said.",neutral,0.6146050691604614

Click to View More Outlook for January 27 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The index remained weak throughout the session as it stayed below the 20 EMA on the hourly chart. In addition, the index has finally slipped below the 200 DMA on a closing basis, suggesting capitulation by the bulls after a futile attempt to defend the crucial long-term moving average. As a result, short- to medium-term sentiment is likely to remain weak as long as the index trades below 25,500. On the downside, the decline could extend toward 24,700 in the short term. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets remained volatile and declined nearly one percent, resuming the prevailing corrective trend. The Nifty index opened in positive territory on easing geopolitical tensions but soon gave up its gains and drifted lower amid persistent selling pressure, eventually settling near the day’s low at 25,048.65. Selling was broad-based, with realty, energy and banking stocks among the key laggards, while only a few defensive and select cyclical names provided limited support. Broader market indices also mirrored the weakness, with midcap and smallcap indices falling close to two percent each, highlighting widespread risk-off positioning and cautious participation. Market sentiment was weighed down by renewed concerns over global trade and geopolitical developments, along with continued foreign institutional selling. Currency weakness further added to the negative bias, as the Indian rupee slipped to fresh lows against the US dollar during the session. In the absence of strong domestic triggers, trading remained largely stock-specific, marked by selective buying and pronounced selling across the broader market. Technically, the Nifty has slipped below its long-term moving average, the 200 DEMA, which signals the possibility of further downside. The 24,750–24,900 zone now emerges as the next key support area, while the 25,300–25,400 zone is likely to act as an immediate hurdle in case of any rebound. That said, select pockets continue to show resilience and are offering buying opportunities. In this environment, participants are advised to maintain a selective and balanced approach, take positions on both sides based on sectoral strength and weakness, and keep a strict check on position sizing. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing a bounce back in the last couple of sessions, Nifty slipped into sharp weakness on Friday and closed the day lower by 241 points. After opening on a positive note, the market was not able to sustain the opening gains and started with weakness since early part of the session. The weakness got intensified in the mid to later part and Nifty finally closed at the lows. A long bear candle was formed on the daily chart which indicates a formation of lower top reversal pattern at the recent swing highs of 25400 levels. Nifty on the weekly chart formed a long bear candle this week after the minor bounce of last week. The overall chart pattern remains negative and one may expect Nifty sliding below the recent low of 24900 by next week. The near-term downside target to be watched around 24600.

Buy Zee Entertainment Enterprises; target of Rs 120: ICICI Securities,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/buy-zee-entertainment-enterprises-target-of-rs-120-icici-securities-13788371.html,"ICICI Securities's research report on Zee Entertainment Enterprises In Q3FY26, subscription revenue grew 7% YoY, driven by Zee5 and the renewal of B2B broadcast contracts. Zee5 turned EBITDA positive this quarter, reporting EBITDA of INR 564mn. Other sales and services grew 6x YoY, driven by distribution income from Kantara 2 and Akhanda 2. TV market share gain of 60bps YoY remained a key positive for the linear TV segment. Advertising revenue declined 9% YoY, primarily due to continued FMCG softness, though it improved 6% QoQ. Management expects advertising recovery to be gradual driven by GST cuts and a pickup in brand-building initiatives by FMCG players. While the stock remains inexpensive at current market prices, we believe a tangible recovery in advertising income is crucial for re-rating. Outlook We maintain BUY with a revised TP of INR 120 (INR 185), based on an 18x one-year forward P/E multiple (FY27E). Key risks: Slower recovery in ad/subscription revenue; and slower execution of cost optimisation measures.
