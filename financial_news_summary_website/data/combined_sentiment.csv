Earlier today, The Economic Times had reported citing people familiar with the development that the pharma company is the frontrunner to acquire Zentiva from Advent International for $5-5.5 billion, or Rs 43,500-47,900 crore. The shares of Aurobindo Pharma recovered from early lows soon after the statement was made public, though still lower by 3 percent in the trading session. ""...at present, no binding agreement or definitive decision has been made by the Board of Directors of the Company in relation to the transaction referred to in the said article(s). Accordingly, the said news item is premature and should not be relied upon,"" the company filing said. Aurobindo Pharma added that it 'regularly explores' various strategic opportunities, including potential acquisitions and partnerships, which can enhance shareholder value. ""In the event of any definitive development requiring disclosure under the SEBI Listing Regulations, the Company will promptly make the necessary and timely announcements to the stock exchanges in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements,"" Aurobindo Pharma added.

""With this partnership, PGEL becomes one of the very few companies in India to manufacture POS devices, further diversifying our portfolio and reinforcing our commitment to scaling EMS in high-growth technology categories,"" Vikas Gupta, Managing Director – Operations, PG Electroplast said. India's digital payments ecosystem has been one of the fastest growing in the world, and this partnership aligns with the Make in India theme. ""Partnering with PG Electroplast allows us to strengthen our presence in India by combining PAX’s technology leadership with PGEL’s proven manufacturing expertise,"" Sanjeev Sandhu, CEO of PAX India said. During the June quarter, PG Electro's net profit fell 21 percent on year to Rs 67 crore as against Rs 85 crore a year ago, as an early arrival of monsoon impacted seasonal sales, prompting it to lower its FY26 growth guidance. Following order cancellations this summer, the AC maker is now sitting on a substantial inventory of air conditioners and raw materials worth Rs 1,300 crore, which has cast a shadow on the full-year guidance. ""...we were confident heading into FY26, and our guidance reflected that optimism. But what changed quite quickly and unexpectedly was the weather. The monsoon arrived earlier than usual, and the room AC season ended abruptly. Sellout in the trade channel was lower than forecasted and inventory levels stayed higher for longer. In hindsight, we were not fully prepared for that kind of shift in this quarter,"" Vishal Gupta, MD (Finance), PG Electroplast had said after the June quarter earnings. The company had invested to set up a new air conditioner compressor plant along with a Chinese partner for internal requirement as well as to supply to other OEMs, which has been delayed to fiscal 2027, adding to the recent sour sentiment. However, Geojit Financial recently issued a Buy call though with a lower price target of Rs 623 per share, stating that all negatives are priced in. Geojit expects PGEL's inventory to be cleared in H2FY26 as seasonal demand picks up, with management looking to diversify to other business verticals like refrigerator, EV and compressor manufacturing. ""...we are planning a lot of diversifications and the results of those will be visible to you in the coming years,"" Pramod Gupta, CFO, PGEL said during the June quarter earnings call. As of FY24, PGEL generated over 60 percent of its revenue from air conditioners, washing machines and air coolers, and has now started to diversify into electronics, printed circuit board assemblies as well as plastic moulding. PGEL has already tied up to make EVs and lithium-ion batteries in partnership with Spiro Mobility (Africa).

The stock has now gained in four out of the last five trading sessions. In the past one week, shares of Ola Electric have surged by 20 percent, compared to a one percent rise in the benchmark Nifty 50 index. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Earlier this week, the stock gained further attention after founder and chairman Bhavish Aggarwal laid out an ambitious growth strategy at the company’s annual Sankalp event. The company is aiming for a 25 to 30 percent share of India’s two-wheeler electric vehicle market, backed by vertical integration and new product launches. “Our target market share for two-wheeler EVs is about 25 to 30 percent with very high margins, so we believe we are on the trajectory again,” Aggarwal said. He added that Ola’s “mojo is still there” despite the challenges faced during its transition phase. Over the past 6 months, Ola Electric phased out its Gen 2 scooters, increased supplies of its Gen 3 models, and rolled out its first electric bike. “It’s been two quarters of transition. Along with product transition, we’ve had a distribution scale-up. You’ll now see, leading into the festive season, the market share volumes starting to inch upwards,” Aggarwal noted. He also stressed that profitability in electric vehicles requires more than just scale. “No one is making money. To make money with EVs, you need vertical integration, you need the technology development, you need the DNA of technology,” Aggarwal said. On the earnings side, Ola Electric reported a weak first quarter compared with the same period last year, though results were better when compared sequentially. Losses narrowed and revenue improved quarter-on-quarter. The company’s gross margin improved by 1,100 basis points sequentially and by 740 basis points compared to last year. Gross margins stood at 26 percent at the end of the June quarter, while the management expects the full-year gross margin to be in the range of 35 to 40 percent.

Aurobindo Pharma shares slide 4% on reports of Zentiva buyout talks,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/aurobindo-pharma-shares-slide-4-on-reports-of-zentiva-buyout-talks-13470262.html,"Aurobindo Pharma shares fell over 4 percent to Rs 1,039 apiece on August 20 after reports suggested that the company has emerged as the front-runner to acquire Prague-based generic drugmaker Zentiva for $5-5.5 billion (Rs 43,500-47,900 crore) from Advent International. If this deal goes through, it will be the largest-ever acquisition by an Indian pharmaceutical company, both domestically and internationally. It would surpass the $3.2 billion acquisition of Daiichi Sankyo’s stake in Ranbaxy in 2014, as well as Biocon Biologics’ $3.3 billion cash-and-stock deal to buy the global biosimilars business of US-based Viatris, the report said. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog According to the report, the deal is expected to strengthen Aurobindo’s footprint in Europe, particularly in Eastern European markets such as the Czech Republic, Romania, and Slovakia. These regions are seen as promising growth areas for biosimilars, especially as patents of major prescription drugs expire. So far in 2025, Aurobindo Pharma’s stock has declined by 21 percent, compared with a 2 percent modest rise in the benchmark Nifty 50 index. On the financial front, the company posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 824 crore in the June 2025 quarter (Q1 FY26), compared with Rs 918 crore in the same quarter of the previous year (Q1 FY25), reflecting a 10.2 percent year-on-year decline. Revenue from operations stood at Rs 7,868 crore in Q1 FY26, up four percent from Rs 7,567 crore in Q1 FY25. Operating EBITDA came in at Rs 1,603 crore in Q1 FY26 compared to Rs 1,619.6 crore in Q1 FY25. The EBITDA margin slipped to 20.4 percent year-on-year from 21.4 percent in the same quarter last year. Aurobindo Pharma’s US formulations revenue fell 1.9 percent year-on-year to Rs 3,488 crore ($408 million). The decline was attributed to destocking and seasonal headwinds. However, the company’s European formulations business remained strong, recording an 18 percent year-on-year growth to Rs 2,338 crore.

President Trump’s tariff stance, seen as arbitrary and unpredictable, could persist, weighing on India in the near term and forcing the market to factor in its impact,"" V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Ltd, said. Experts say FII selling is also a worry for markets. To be sure, Foreign investors (FIIs/FPIs) turned net sellers again on Tuesday, after a day of buying, offloading Indian equities worth Rs 634 crore. Domestic institutional investors (DIIs), meanwhile, sustained their support with net purchases of Rs 2,261 crore, according to provisional exchange data. At the opening bell, sectoral trends were mixed. Nifty Auto, IT and Consumer Durables were largely flat, while FMCG, Pharma, Metal, PSU Bank, Private Bank and Oil & Gas saw mild declines. Banking stocks were under pressure, dragging Nifty Bank down 0.4 percent. On the positive side, Energy, Infra and Realty indices inched higher, even as Media slipped nearly 1 percent. Volatility also edged up, with India VIX rising 0.9 percent. Among individual stocks, state-run defence equipment manufacturer Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (HAL) rose xx percent after CNBC TV-18 reported that the company is likely to receive a big purchase order. The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) has cleared the purchase of 97 Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Mark1A fighter jets worth Rs 62,000 crore from HAL. An official confirmation would mean one of the largest purchase orders for the state-run enterprise, where the fighter jets would be indigenously developed. Shares of online gaming companies, including Delta Corp, Nazara Technologies and OnMobile Global, tumbled up to x percent after the Union Cabinet approved a Bill to regulate the sector. The proposed law prohibits online money gaming and related advertisements, prescribing fines and imprisonment for violators. Phoenix Mills shares jumped x percent after the company said the Competition Commission of India cleared its plan to buy out Canada Pension Plan Investment Board’s 49 percent stake in Island Star Mall Development for Rs 5,449.16 crore, giving PML full ownership and sole control of the subsidiary. Technical View Nifty continues to demonstrate strength while holding above its gap support near 24,800. A sustained breakout above 25,050 could unleash strong bullish momentum, as significant call writers risk being trapped, leading to potential short covering. On the downside, any dip towards the 24,750 zone is likely to be absorbed as an accumulation opportunity. Robust positioning by Put writers at near-the-money strikes further reinforces this constructive view. Only a decisive breach below 24,700 would warrant caution; until then, the bulls are expected to maintain control. For now, a “buy on dips” strategy remains the most prudent approach, with traders closely watching for a decisive breakout to resolve the current consolidation phase. Bharti Airtel, NTPC, Infosys, Eternal, and Hindustan Unilever were the top gainers on the Nifty. Shriram Finance, Bajaj Finance, Jio Financial Services, Hindalco, and Tata Motors were the major laggards.

According to government sources cited by CNBC TV-18, the Cabinet Committee on Security has cleared the acquisition of 97 Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Mark1A fighter jets for about Rs 62,000 crore. A formal announcement would mark a major milestone for HAL, which has been working on the indigenous Tejas programme to replace India’s ageing MiG-21 fleet. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The LCA Mk1A, an upgraded variant of the Tejas, has been designed for enhanced combat capabilities. This will be the second big order for the aircraft after HAL secured a contract in February 2021. Deliveries are expected to kick off this year, with six jets scheduled for FY26, following the resolution of earlier engine supply challenges. UBS has maintained a ‘neutral’ stance on the stock with a target price of Rs 4,900, noting that execution of the new order will add to HAL’s already strong pipeline. Meanwhile, HAL posted a mixed performance in its June quarter results. Net profit declined 3.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,383.8 crore, even as revenue from operations climbed 10.8 percent to Rs 4,819 crore. A healthier product mix and execution of its Rs 1.89 lakh crore order book lifted operating performance — EBITDA rose nearly 30 percent to Rs 1,284 crore, with margins expanding to 26.7 percent from 22.8 percent a year earlier, defying expectations of a contraction. With a robust order pipeline, improving margins and a fresh round of aircraft orders in the offing, HAL remains firmly positioned at the centre of India’s defence manufacturing push. After Q1, Motilal Oswal said that the aircraft deliveries will likely pick up pace as engine supplies from GE ramp up, which should further support revenue visibility. At about 9:20 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 4,560, higher by 2.5 percent from the last close on the NSE.

At 8:20 am, Gift Nifty hinted at a muted open, trading at 24,966, down 45 points or 0.18 percent. Indian equities surged on August 19, notched a fourth straight day of gains on August 19, powered by strong rallies in auto, oil & gas, metal, and FMCG stocks. The cheer spread across the board, with mid and smallcaps stealing the spotlight as they outpaced the frontline indices. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Foreign investors (FIIs/FPIs) turned net sellers again on Tuesday, after a day of buying, offloading Indian equities worth Rs 634 crore. Domestic institutional investors (DIIs), meanwhile, sustained their support with net purchases of Rs 2,261 crore, according to provisional exchange data. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session Nifty continues to demonstrate strength while holding above its gap support near 24,800. A sustained breakout above 25,050 could unleash strong bullish momentum, as significant call writers risk being trapped, leading to potential short covering. On the downside, any dip towards the 24,750 zone is likely to be absorbed as an accumulation opportunity. Robust positioning by Put writers at near-the-money strikes further reinforces this constructive view. Only a decisive breach below 24,700 would warrant caution; until then, the bulls are expected to maintain control. For now, a “buy on dips” strategy remains the most prudent approach, with traders closely watching for a decisive breakout to resolve the current consolidation phase. ""While the Nifty Bank index has managed to sustain higher levels, private sector banks are yet to exhibit decisive strength, leading to choppy momentum. The immediate roadblock remains at 56,000–56,100, and only a breakout above this zone would unleash strong bullish momentum through short-covering activity,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. ""On the downside, dips towards 55,500 remain attractive for accumulation as Put writers continue building positions at near-the-money strikes. A breach below 55,450 would be the first sign of weakness, but until then, bulls are likely to retain control. In the current scenario, a “buy-on-dips” strategy remains prudent, with traders closely monitoring the 56,100 level for a breakout that could potentially resolve the ongoing consolidation phase,"" he added. India VIX fell sharply by 4.46 percent to close at 11.79. Despite lingering global headwinds, volatility remains subdued, reflecting expectations of consolidation rather than a steep correction. This indicates cautious optimism among market participants without evident signs of fear. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) has risen from 0.85 to 1.11, underlining the strengthening grip of put writers at current levels. The increasing PCR, or being higher than 0.7 or surpassing 1, means traders are selling more Put options than Call options, which generally indicates the firming up of a bullish sentiment in the market.

Intel’s $24 billion rally sends valuation to dot-com levels,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/intel-s-24-billion-rally-sends-valuation-to-dot-com-levels-13469435.html,"After months of turbulence, Intel Corp. bulls are finally being rewarded for their patience. But the stock’s sudden rebound comes with a worrying side-effect: a valuation so high its most recent precedent is from the dot-com era more than two decades ago. Shares of the struggling chipmaker have rallied 28% this month, adding about $24 billion in market value, on reports that the US government is in talks for a potential equity stake, as well as plans for a $2 billion investment from Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. The jump has Intel trading at 53 times profits projected over the next 12 months, the highest since early 2002, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “The stock looks incredibly expensive here,” said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services. “That kind of multiple is a bet that the government will push Intel so hard on customers that it becomes a winner.” The surge in Intel this month followed a slump in the wake of a disappointing earnings report on July 24 and criticism of Tan earlier by President Donald Trump, who called for the CEO to step down, citing conflicts of interest. After meeting with Tan on Aug. 11, Trump changed his tune, saying Tan’s “success and rise is an amazing story.” Since then, reports have circulated that the Trump administration is in discussions to take a stake of about 10% in the company. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a CNBC interview on Tuesday that the talks are aimed at converting US grants already made to Intel under the Chips and Science Act into non-voting equity. Of course, the US’s plans regarding Intel haven’t been finalized and could still change. Intel declined to comment on Lutnick’s remarks. For Paul Nolte, market strategist and senior wealth manager at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management, the potential government involvement could benefit Intel in the short-term but may pose a risk in the long term. “This strikes me as an easy road to get onto, but a hard one to get out of,” Nolte said. “At the end of the day, this raises so many more questions than it answers.” Meanwhile, Intel’s premium valuation is largely a reflection of just how much its profitability has collapsed in recent years. Intel is projected to generate more than $1 billion in adjusted profit over the next four quarters, after losing about $1.3 billion in the previous four, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. From 2018 to 2021 the company generated more than $20 billion in annual profits on average. “We have no idea what Intel can deliver in earnings growth since it is so behind on tech and because you can’t cost-cut your way to growth,” said Nancy Tengler, chief executive officer of Laffer Tengler Investments. “It’s hard to have confidence in the estimates, which makes it difficult to assess the valuation. I think it’s overvalued, but I also think the picture is so uncertain that it wouldn’t be attractive at any price.” Wall Street largely echoes her caution. Fewer than 8% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, while nearly 80% have the equivalent of a neutral rating. In addition, at its Tuesday close of $25.31, Intel trades notably above the average price target of about $22, representing the weakest return potential among components of the Nasdaq 100 Index. Still, there is optimism that Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan will be able to turn things around. Much of his focus has been on cost cutting, which has improved Intel’s outlook to return to profitability but raised concerns the chipmaker may be bowing out of the race for technological leadership. Part of his effort has also been centered on a costly build out of its foundry operations undertaken by his predecessor, Pat Gelsinger. “Clearly it’s going to take a number of years for it to really start operating on a smooth basis,” said Gerrit Smit, lead portfolio manager of the Stonehage Fleming Global Best Ideas Equity fund. “We’ve got trust in him, but we think he’s got a long slog ahead.”","Shares of the struggling chipmaker have rallied 28% this month, adding about $24 billion in market value, on reports that the US government is in talks for a potential equity stake, as well as plans for a $2 billion investment from Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp.","Shares of the struggling chipmaker have rallied 28% this month, adding about $24 billion in market value, on reports that the US government is in talks for a potential equity stake, as well as plans for a $2 billion investment from Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp.","Shares of the struggling chipmaker have rallied 28% this month, adding about $24 billion in market value, on reports that the US government is in talks for a potential equity stake, as well as plans for a $2 billion investment from Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp.","“That kind of multiple is a bet that the government will push Intel so hard on customers that it becomes a winner.” The surge in Intel this month followed a slump in the wake of a disappointing earnings report on July 24 and criticism of Tan earlier by President Donald Trump, who called for the CEO to step down, citing conflicts of interest.",negative,0.9453023076057434

"Asian shares, Nasdaq futures fall after tech slide",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-shares-nasdaq-futures-fall-after-tech-slide-13469397.html,"Asian equities fell at the open, mirroring Wall Street’s retreat after a sharp selloff in heavyweight technology shares. Stocks opened lower in Japan, Australia and South Korea while MSCI’s Asia Pacific Index fell 0.3%. Contracts for the Nasdaq 100 index slipped 0.2% after a 1.4% drop Tuesday, the second-worst decline since April’s tariff shock. The slide was driven by a 3.5% slump in Nvidia Corp. as stock rotation hit megacap tech companies. Treasuries steadied in early Asian trading after 10-year yields dropped three basis points to 4.31%. Oil rose 0.4% after declining in the prior session. A gauge of the dollar extended its gains to a third day. Investors pared back positions in technology stocks — the market’s longtime leaders — amid growing concern that the rally since April has advanced too far and too quickly. That momentum will be tested this week as focus turns to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to speak on Friday with traders firming up bets on a September cut. “Wall Street finally hit an air pocket overnight as the US summer lull thins liquidity and weakens the bid for risk assets, especially high flying tech stocks,” wrote Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne. “There’s also a degree of trepidation heading into the Jackson Hole symposium.” Bank of America Corp. strategists led by Michael Hartnett have recently said the rally that’s propelled the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks higher from April lows looks stretched. Hartnett has repeatedly warned of a bubble risk in US shares this year. “It is always easier when the markets are going up,” said Nicholas Bohnsack at Strategas. “It is difficult to poke holes in the bull case; the path of least resistance is likely higher, but we find ourselves increasingly worried that traditional risk assets (stocks and bonds) appear priced to perfection.” Meanwhile, US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem indicated the government will step up scrutiny of imports of steel, copper, lithium and other materials from China to enforce a ban on goods allegedly made with forced labor in the country’s Xinjiang region. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also claimed some of the “richest families in India” benefited from the purchase of Russian crude oil, while reiterating plans to boost tariffs on the South Asian nation. Meantime, traders are gearing up for Powell’s speech with the Treasury market seeing a quarter-point rate cut next month as virtually locked-in and at least one more by year-end. Investors are waiting to see if Powell affirms the market pricing — or pushes back with a reminder that new data arriving before the next policy gathering could change the picture. They’re also looking for clues about the longer-run trajectory of Fed cuts into next year. A couple of weeks ago, when the latest jobs report revealed a slump in hiring, the case for lower rates appeared all but closed. Then came the sharpest spike in US wholesale prices in three years – fuel for the concern about tariff-led inflation that’s kept Fed officials on hold so far this year. “We’ll argue that the biggest risk for Treasuries is if the Fed chief chooses to throw cold water on the widely anticipated September rate cut,” said Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets. While this is not Lyngen’s base-case scenario, he says the front-end of the curve is vulnerable to a correction if Powell doesn’t deliver on the degree of dovishness currently anticipated. Also, President Donald Trump reiterated his criticism of Powell saying the Fed chair is hurting the housing industry by not lowering rates. “There is no inflation, and every sign is pointing to a major rate cut,” Trump posted on Truth Social. On the geopolitical front, Trump urged Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy to show some “flexibility” as the US president accelerates his efforts to end the war in Ukraine and encourages the two leaders to hold a bilateral summit. “While there’s a sense that the path to peace is at least slightly clearer, traders remain wary,” said Fawad Razaqzada at City Index and Forex.com. “And rightly so – the toughest conversations, namely over territory, still lie ahead.”","Meantime, traders are gearing up for Powell’s speech with the Treasury market seeing a quarter-point rate cut next month as virtually locked-in and at least one more by year-end.",Investors pared back positions in technology stocks — the market’s longtime leaders — amid growing concern that the rally since April has advanced too far and too quickly.,"Meantime, traders are gearing up for Powell’s speech with the Treasury market seeing a quarter-point rate cut next month as virtually locked-in and at least one more by year-end.","“It is difficult to poke holes in the bull case; the path of least resistance is likely higher, but we find ourselves increasingly worried that traditional risk assets (stocks and bonds) appear priced to perfection.” Meanwhile, US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem indicated the government will step up scrutiny of imports of steel, copper, lithium and other materials from China to enforce a ban on goods allegedly made with forced labor in the country’s Xinjiang region.",negative,0.6092061400413513
PSU majors drive Q1FY26 defence earnings in a soft quarter but analysts continue to flag high valuations,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/psu-majors-drive-q1fy26-defence-earnings-in-a-soft-quarter-but-analysts-continue-to-flag-high-valuations-13469336.html,"India’s defence companies reported a steady set of earnings for the June quarter, with public-sector undertakings Bharat Electronics Ltd. (BEL), Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (HAL) and Bharat Dynamics Ltd. (BDL) delivering healthy numbers while several private firms struggled. Analysts said the seasonally soft first quarter was satisfactory overall, with PSU order books supporting growth even as valuations remain stretched. During the quarter, PSU major BEL posted a 23 percent rise in net profit to Rs 960.7 crore on revenues of Rs 4,439.7 crore, up 5 percent year-on-year. HAL reported revenue of Rs 4,819 crore against Rs 4,347.5 crore a year earlier, though profit dipped 4 percent to Rs 1,373.5 crore due to higher pension costs. BDL emerged as the standout performer with profit up 154 percent to Rs 18.4 crore on revenue growth of 23 percent to Rs 231.1 crore. “Broadly, Q1 is a seasonally weak quarter, with around 15 percent of annual earnings recorded for defence companies. Shipbuilding companies also reported healthy numbers. Since Q3 and Q4 are usually stronger for defence/PSU engineering companies, Q1 looks satisfactory,” said Amit Anwani, Senior Research Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher. Private versus PSU Among private players, Astra Microwave nearly tripled its profit to Rs 14.7 crore on revenue of Rs 199.7 crore, a 29 percent increase year-on-year, while DCX Systems reported a 61 percent revenue jump to Rs 222.2 crore with profit rising 41 percent to Rs 4.1 crore. Sika Interplant Systems more than doubled revenue to Rs 68 crore and profit to Rs 10.4 crore, a 96 percent increase from last year. But others saw declines. Zen Technologies’ profit fell 33 percent to Rs 53.6 crore as revenue dropped 38 percent to Rs 158.2 crore from Rs 254.6 crore. Ideaforge swung to a loss of Rs 23.6 crore after revenue collapsed 85 percent to Rs 12.8 crore from Rs 86.2 crore a year earlier. “Q1 FY26 revealed a tale of two narratives in Indian defence. Bharat Dynamics emerged as the star performer, delivering a spectacular 157% profit surge while managing 30% revenue growth, showcasing exceptional operational leverage in missile systems. Garden Reach Shipbuilders continued its strong trajectory with 37% profit growth, backed by robust execution of its Rs 22,680 crore order book. Among private players, DCX Systems impressed with 61% revenue acceleration,” said Robin Arya, smallcase Manager and Founder of GoalFi. The disappointments, he noted were equally stark. ""Mazagon Dock's profit collapse of 35% despite decent revenue growth exposed severe margin deterioration from 27.4% to 11.4%, indicating operational inefficiencies. HAL's 4% profit decline was particularly concerning given its market leadership and massive Rs 1.89 lakh crore order book, with higher pension obligations weighing on performance,” Arya added. Anwani, however, added that the numbers don’t necessarily show poor performance for private players compared to PSUS. “The PSU order book was already very strong at the end of FY25 and has multiplied, which is now showing up in execution. For private players like Data Patterns, their order books were already strong in prior years, so relative growth looks weaker, but they still delivered decent results. The base effect also matters as order execution ramps up, growth looks stronger year-on-year for PSUs,” he explained. Order books remain strong HAL highlighted a pipeline of helicopter orders worth about Rs 1 lakh crore and projected an overall order book of Rs 2.5 lakh crore. BEL guided for 17–18% annual growth over the next two to three years, while shipbuilders cited strong government support, including Rs 75,000 crore earmarked for shipbuilding clusters. “The PSU order book was already very strong at the end of FY25 and has multiplied, which is now showing up in execution. For private players like Data Patterns, their order books were already strong in prior years, so relative growth looks weaker, but they still delivered decent results,” Anwani said. Similarly, Arya pointed out that private defence companies delivered much better in operational excellence, highlighting their superior agility and execution capabilities. “This performance gap reflects private companies' ability to adapt quickly to market demands and optimize operations without bureaucratic constraints. However, scale remains with PSUs, who command Rs 8.22 lakh crore in combined market capitalization compared to private players' Rs 20,068 crore,” he said. Valuations remain stretched Despite the robust fundamentals, valuations remain elevated. The Nifty Defence Index is trading at an average forward P/E of 43.7 times, compared with a peak of over 60 times in FY25, and well above long-term market norms. HAL is trading at about 30–33 times forward earnings with a price-to-book multiple of 8.5x, which analysts see as relatively comfortable given its ₹2.5 lakh crore order book. BEL, however, commands a higher premium at 41–44 times earnings and a P/B of 13.9x, reflecting strong growth expectations but limited margin for error. BDL trades at 105 times forward earnings with a P/B of 14.3x, making it one of the most expensive names in the sector despite its recent operational gains. Private defence electronics firms such as Data Patterns and Astra Microwave are valued in the 45–50 times earnings range, while shipbuilders like Mazagon Dock and Garden Reach, though not part of this quarter’s review, trade at 38–40 times forward earnings. “Valuations are stretched. HAL looks relatively comfortable at around 33 times, but BEL and others are trading well above their historical averages. Execution has to be near flawless to justify these multiples,” Anwani said. Arya added: “Large-cap PSUs like HAL and BEL appear relatively reasonable given their order book visibility, while smaller companies reflect high growth expectations that may be difficult to sustain. Execution perfection is already priced in.” Outlook and management commentary Analysts noted that despite some short-term concerns on supply chain and tariffs, most managements remained positive. Anwani noted: “HAL management was confident about LCA deliveries and progress across programs like AMCA and unmanned systems. They highlighted a pipeline of helicopter orders worth about Rs 1 lakh crore. BEL guided for 17–18% growth for the next 2–3 years, and shipbuilding companies cited strong pipelines. The government is investing around Rs 75,000 crore in shipbuilding clusters and focusing on three pillars – indigenous components, R&D for homegrown platforms, and a robust vendor base to support manufacturing and exports.” He added that short-term risks remain supply chain–related, particularly rare-earth materials. “Some companies carry 6–7 months of inventory, so effects may show later. The situation is fluid, but the overall trajectory is positive,” he said. Arya added that his outlook remains constructively optimistic on structural tailwinds while becoming more selective on execution capabilities. “ICRA's 15–17% FY26 revenue growth projection appears achievable given order book strength, but increasing execution differentiation favors established players with proven delivery capabilities. Current valuations demand a more nuanced approach, favoring quality franchises over broad-based exposure,” he said.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Lodha Developers, Marico, Axis Bank, KIMS, Tube Investments of India, L&T Finance, and others on August 20?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-lodha-developers-marico-axis-bank-kims-tube-investments-of-india-l-t-finance-and-others-on-august-20-13469345.html,"Bulls retained their dominance, helping the benchmark indices post over 0.4 percent gains on August 19. The market breadth remained positive, with about 1,862 shares advancing compared to 862 declining shares on the NSE. The trend is expected to remain favourable for bulls despite a possible immediate consolidation following the recent rally. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities Lodha Developers | CMP: Rs 1,257.8 After a short-term correction from higher levels, the downward momentum in Lodha Developers has halted, and the stock has consolidated over the past few sessions. On the daily charts, the counter has formed a rounding bottom chart formation and reversed its trend from an important demand zone. The structure suggests a revival of the uptrend from the current levels in the near future. For traders, Rs 1,210 would be the key support level to watch. Sustaining above this level, the uptrend structure could continue toward Rs 1,350. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,350 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,210 Marico | CMP: Rs 728 Marico has shown a robust rally from lower levels in recent sessions. Additionally, it is continuously trading in an ascending triangle chart formation. This overall structure indicates a likely breakout for a new leg of an up move from current levels. For positional traders, Rs 695 would be the decisive level. Trading above this level, the uptrend could continue toward Rs 775. However, if it closes below Rs 695, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 775 Stop-Loss: Rs 695 Axis Bank | CMP: Rs 1,083.2 Following a decline from higher levels, Axis Bank has rebounded from its retracement zone and witnessed a steady recovery. Additionally, on the daily charts, the counter has given a breakout from its rangebound formation. The recent up move suggests a new leg of bullish trend. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,040 could act as the trend-decider level. If it sustains above this, a further uptrend toward Rs 1,160 can be expected. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,160 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,040 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences | CMP: Rs 769.15 The stock has been moving up, forming higher highs and higher lows, which keeps the daily trend bullish as per Dow Theory. On August 11, prices found support at the upward-sloping trendline and saw an exponential rise of over 11%. Since then, not a single candle has closed below the prior day’s low, keeping the daily bias positive. Despite the sharp rally, the daily RSI is at a comfortable 60 level, giving enough room for further upside. Follow-up buying can potentially lift prices toward the swing high near Rs 800. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 800, Rs 835 Stop-Loss: Rs 750 L&T Finance | CMP: Rs 217 In the previous session, L&T Finance made a lifetime high at Rs 217.65, outperforming its peers. Prices also broke above the previous swing high near Rs 215 with a gain of over 3%, indicating growing bullish momentum. The stock has broken out of the upper Bollinger Band with rising volumes over the past two sessions, confirming strength. Additionally, the MACD has recently given a bullish crossover, offering double confirmation. Given the sharp nature of the rise, dips should be used as buying opportunities rather than trying to catch the top. Targets are seen at Rs 222, followed by Rs 230. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 222, Rs 230 Stop-Loss: Rs 208 Tube Investments of India | CMP: Rs 3,152.4 The stock has been forming a classic rounding bottom pattern on the daily chart since July 2025. In the previous session, it surged over 3% and closed above the neckline near Rs 3,140, signaling a breakout. For upward momentum to sustain, acceptance above Rs 3,175 is required.Furthermore, the 15-period EMA and 30-period EMA have recently shown a bullish crossover, reinforcing a positive outlook. Over the past six trading sessions, prices have consistently protected the previous candle’s low on a closing basis, showing strength. A breakout above Rs 3,175 could trigger a fresh rally. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,300, Rs 3,420 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,050 Vinay Rajani, Senior Technical and Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities Nippon India ETF Nifty Infrastructure BeES | CMP: Rs 945.65 After six weeks of decline, the Infra index appears to have resumed its primary uptrend. The ETF has reclaimed levels above the 50 DEMA and broken out from a bullish “Flag” pattern on the weekly chart, indicating a continuation of the long-term bullish trend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 910 Groww Nifty India Railways PSU ETF | CMP: Rs 35.01 Most railway stocks seem to have bottomed out, as oscillators have exited the oversold zone. The ETF has formed a strong base near Rs 34 over the past five trading sessions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 37.50 Stop-Loss: Rs 33.5 Edelweiss BSE Capital Markets & Insurance ETF | CMP: Rs 23.68 Capital Markets, AMC, and insurance themes appear to have gathered bullish momentum on the charts, which could benefit the Ecapinsure ETF.

However, blended marketing margin stood 25% above estimate at INR8.3/litre (up 75% YoY). Refining throughput and marketing volumes came in line with estimates. The Union Cabinet has approved INR300b in LPG compensation to OMCs, which will be paid in 12 tranches. While the disbursement timeline remains undisclosed, we estimate BPCL to receive ~INR37.5b in both FY26/FY27 (25% of total compensation). This will result in a ~5% increase in BPCL’s FY27E BVPS. Outlook While valuation appears reasonable and strong marketing performance continues, a muted medium-term refining outlook (our FY26/FY27 PAT estimates are 17%/18% sensitive to every USD1/bbl change in GRM) and the commencement of a new capex cycle emerge as key concerns.

"RIL's rating could be upgraded over next 12 months, says S&P",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ril-s-rating-could-be-upgraded-over-next-12-months-says-s-p-13467569.html,"Rating agency S&P said Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) could be in line for a rating upgrade over the next 12 months, citing the company’s growing presence in digital services as a driver of stronger earnings and a shield against volatile global macroeconomic conditions. ""We expect the share of earnings from Reliance Industries' domestically-centred businesses such as digital services and retail to rise to about 60 percent by the end of fiscal 2026 (ending March 31, 2026), from about 45 percent in fiscal 2022. These businesses tend to have more predictable performances than the company’s cyclical oil and gas-related businesses,"" S&P said in its report. RIL reported an EBITDA of Rs 58,000 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, beating S&P’s expectations. The performance was driven by strong growth in digital services through Reliance Jio Infocomm, resilient earnings in the oil-to-chemicals (O2C) segment, and a one-time gain of Rs 8,900 crore from the sale of a minority stake in Asian Paints Ltd during the quarter. S&P said earnings from the O2C segment are expected to remain resilient owing to RIL’s complex processing facilities and strong domestic energy market presence. For fiscal 2025, the O2C EBITDA declined by only 12 percent compared with a 20-45 percent fall for other Asian refining and petrochemical companies. The segment is projected to see a modest 3-5 percent decline this fiscal year despite global volatility. Reliance Jio is expected to benefit from higher tariffs and a growing subscriber base. S&P estimated the unit’s EBITDA will rise 15-17 percent in fiscal 2026, aided by the full-year impact of a 12.5-27 percent increase in mobile tariffs effective July 3, 2024. Overall, RIL’s earnings are projected to grow 6-8 percent to Rs 1.8 lakh crore in fiscal 2026, with its debt-to-EBITDA ratio seen stable at 1.5x-1.7x. The report noted that RIL continues to pursue growth plans, including investments in its JioStar media business acquired in November 2024 and expansion in renewable energy. Annual operating cash flows of Rs 1.3-1.4 lakh crore are expected to largely fund capital expenditure of about Rs 1.4 lakh crore over the next two years. S&P said the company has adequate headroom to fund growth aspirations and withstand earnings volatility from its energy segments. RIL’s leverage was about 0.64x over the past two fiscal years, compared with S&P Global Ratings’ adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.6x-1.8x.","The performance was driven by strong growth in digital services through Reliance Jio Infocomm, resilient earnings in the oil-to-chemicals (O2C) segment, and a one-time gain of Rs 8,900 crore from the sale of a minority stake in Asian Paints Ltd during the quarter.","Rating agency S&P said Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) could be in line for a rating upgrade over the next 12 months, citing the company’s growing presence in digital services as a driver of stronger earnings and a shield against volatile global macroeconomic conditions.",S&P said the company has adequate headroom to fund growth aspirations and withstand earnings volatility from its energy segments.,"The performance was driven by strong growth in digital services through Reliance Jio Infocomm, resilient earnings in the oil-to-chemicals (O2C) segment, and a one-time gain of Rs 8,900 crore from the sale of a minority stake in Asian Paints Ltd during the quarter.",positive,0.9526180624961853

Click to View More Outlook for August 20 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty remained in strength following a positive start. On the higher end, it reached 25000 where it found an initial level of resistance. The RSI indicator is in a classic bullish crossover, indicating strong positive momentum. Going forward, the index might remain strong; the strength increases above 25000. On the lower end, support is placed at 24800. Positive sentiment remains intact as long as it remains above. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After witnessing a sharp upside breakout on Monday, Nifty continued with follow-through upmove amidst range bound action on Tuesday and closed the day higher by 103 points. After opening with a positive note, the market moved up further in the early to mid-part of the session. However, the psychological hurdle of 25K mark was not taken out and Nifty finally closed below the said mark. A reasonable positive candle was formed on the daily chart with minor upper shadow that placed beside the red candle of Monday. This market action signals a range bound action below the hurdle of 25000 levels. The sharp opening upside gap of Monday remains intact two sessions after its formation. This gap could now be considered as a bullish breakaway gap, which is normally formed at the important bottom reversal. Hence, one may expect Nifty to move up further in the short term and could reach to the upside target of 25300 in the near term. Immediate support is placed at 24850.

But a sustained rally will only come once there are clear signs of an earnings revival,"" V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited, said. ""It would be premature to expect positive responses from the Trump administration given the strain in India–US ties, even as India makes tactical efforts to improve relations with China while reinforcing its strong ties with Russia,"" he added. Sectoral indices were largely trading in the green, led by Nifty Oil & Gas which rose 1.66 percent, followed by Auto up 1.32 percent, Media up 1.19 percent, and FMCG and Infra which gained nearly 1 percent each. Energy, Metals, Realty, Consumer Durables and IT also saw modest advances. Bank indices were mixed with Nifty Bank up 0.18 percent, PSU Bank gaining 0.76 percent and Private Bank adding 0.39 percent. On the broader market front, the Nifty Midcap 100 was up 1 percent and the Smallcap 100 rose 0.7 percent. Pharma was the sole laggard, slipping 0.34 percent, while India VIX dropped over 4 percent to 11.79, reflecting easing volatility. Among movers in today's session, auto stocks were the bright sparks in today's session and rallied up to 6 percent after fresh signals out of New Delhi. According to CNBC TV-18, China’s foreign minister, currently in India for meetings, has assured that Beijing will address key concerns flagged by New Delhi, including the supply of rare earth magnets — a critical input for automakers — and tunnel boring machines. Ola Electric and Tata Motors were the top gainers. Reliance Industries shares rose more than 2 percent in Tuesday’s trade after its Jio telecom unit announced changes in its prepaid tariffs. The gains were supported by upbeat brokerage commentary. Reliance Jio has discontinued its entry-level 1GB per day prepaid packs priced at Rs 209 for 22 days and Rs 249 for 28 days. Brokerage IIFL said the Rs 249 pack contributed less than 10 percent to Jio’s mobile revenues, and the 20 percent hike could directly lift overall revenue by under 2 percent. Axis Capital, however, expects the tariff changes to boost Jio’s FY26E revenue.

"Sebi mulls double-edged move: Higher intraday limits, with expiry-day clampdown and penalties for breach",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mc-exclusive-sebi-s-mulls-double-edged-move-higher-intraday-limits-with-expiry-day-clampdown-and-penalties-for-breach-13467177.html,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is weighing a review of intraday position limits in index options, especially with a focus on reining in excessive trading on expiry days, Moneycontrol has learnt from people familiar with development who requested not to be named. At present, there is no limit for intraday positions, however, exchanges monitor intraday limits at the same thresholds as end-of-day for index options, Rs 1,500 crore on a net delta (futures-equivalent) basis and Rs 10,000 crore on a gross basis. However, Sebi’s examination of recent expiry-day data in Nifty and Sensex contracts showed that positions routinely breached these levels during intraday trade. On the August 7 expiry, for example, the top net long and short positions in Nifty touched Rs 4,245 crore and Rs 5,409 crore, respectively, while gross positions exceeded Rs 10192 crore (long) and Rs 11,777 crore (short). Similarly, on August 5 Sensex expiry day, the top net long position was Rs 2249 crore and top net short position was Rs 3055 crore. Top gross long position was Rs 11,831 crore and top gross short position was Rs 9647 crore. In this backdrop, Sebi is considering increasing the intraday monitoring threshold to Rs 5,000 crore, while keeping the Rs 10,000-crore gross ceiling unchanged. The move follows the regulator’s February 2025 consultation paper that had proposed higher intraday thresholds but was withdrawn in favour of tighter surveillance. Sebi noted that since positions expiring on expiry day do not reflect in end-of-day (EoD) data, intraday monitoring becomes crucial to detect oversized exposures. “The regulatory intent of rationalizing expiry-day hyperactivity while limiting risks associated with large, outsized positions favours stipulating limits for intraday index options positions,” the regulator observed. Though regulator has clarified that additional positions backed by cash, cash equivalents, or securities holdings will be permitted. Also Read: Sebi panel on Takeover Regulations reviews definition of control, no tweaks to open offer and creeping acquisition threshold The latest framework proposes distinguishing between expiry and non-expiry days. On non-expiry days, breaches would only trigger exchange-level scrutiny. On expiry days, however, violations would attract penalties. Exchanges will also be required to monitor intraday positions at four random intervals daily, with at least one check close to market close. Also Read: Sebi proposes less stake dilution, more timeline for public shareholding compliance for large IPOs The issue has been actively discussed with stock exchanges, brokers, and other market participants. SEBI’s proposal seeks to strike a balance between maintaining market integrity and ensuring that liquidity providers and market makers—who often square off intraday positions—are not unduly constrained. Sebi had earlier prescribed a glide path for position limits in index options up to December 5, 2025, allowing participants time to build delta-monitoring systems. With systems expected to be in place by December 6, Sebi plans to operationalize the intraday monitoring framework from that date. By reintroducing intraday limits with sharper surveillance, Sebi aims to address systemic risks, safeguard market integrity, and rein in volatility, particularly on expiry days when speculative activity often peaks. An email seeking comments from Sebi on proposed move did not elicit any response.","At present, there is no limit for intraday positions, however, exchanges monitor intraday limits at the same thresholds as end-of-day for index options, Rs 1,500 crore on a net delta (futures-equivalent) basis and Rs 10,000 crore on a gross basis.","On the August 7 expiry, for example, the top net long and short positions in Nifty touched Rs 4,245 crore and Rs 5,409 crore, respectively, while gross positions exceeded Rs 10192 crore (long) and Rs 11,777 crore (short).","By reintroducing intraday limits with sharper surveillance, Sebi aims to address systemic risks, safeguard market integrity, and rein in volatility, particularly on expiry days when speculative activity often peaks.","On the August 7 expiry, for example, the top net long and short positions in Nifty touched Rs 4,245 crore and Rs 5,409 crore, respectively, while gross positions exceeded Rs 10192 crore (long) and Rs 11,777 crore (short).",neutral,0.7320172190666199

Auto stocks were the bright sparks in today's session and rallied up to 6 percent after fresh signals out of New Delhi.

Ola Electric and Tata Motors were the top gainers.

The gains were supported by upbeat brokerage commentary. Reliance Jio has discontinued its entry-level 1GB per day prepaid packs priced at Rs 209 for 22 days and Rs 249 for 28 days. Brokerage IIFL said the Rs 249 pack contributed less than 10 percent to Jio’s mobile revenues, and the 20 percent hike could directly lift overall revenue by under 2 percent. Axis Capital, however, expects the tariff changes to boost Jio’s FY26E revenue. Shares of Inox Wind rose as much as 6 percent after the company said it had divested a stake worth about Rs 175 crore in its subsidiary Inox Renewable Solutions Ltd. (IRSL). The company disclosed in a regulatory filing that it has signed agreements, last executed on August 18, to sell 49.6 lakh equity shares of IRSL, each with a face value of Rs 10. The transaction values the subsidiary at around Rs 7,400 crore, with the sale expected to be completed within the next seven days.

Cement stocks may be on fire in FY26; GST rate cut buzz fuels fresh rally hopes,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/cement-stocks-may-be-on-fire-in-fy26-gst-rate-cut-buzz-fuels-fresh-rally-hopes-13466098.html,"Cement stocks are having a solid run in FY26 — and the momentum may just be getting started. A mix of steady price hikes, strong Q1 volumes, and earnings beats has already lit up the sector. Now, chatter around a possible GST rate cut from 28 percent to 18 percent has thrown in a new catalyst, stoking bullish bets that the cement rally could shift into an even higher gear. Analysts said lower taxes could drive up demand, expand margins, and even trigger a sector re-rating at a time when consolidation and M&A activity are altering the industry dynamic. In a market that is starved of potential re-rating candidate because of elevated valuations, analysts said the boring cement sector could actually turn out to be the exciting performer. Why GST relief matters Analysts at ICICI Securities said that if the GST rate on cement is reduced from the existing 28 percent to 18 percent, the impact on profitability could be meaningful. They estimated every 1 percent change in realisation can translate into a 3-5 percent impact on EBITDA, providing a significant cushion to margins across the industry. ""The industry will have to pass on the rate cut benefit to consumers but overtime the prices are expected to inch up due to changing market dynamics,"" they added, citing Ultratech Cement as their preferred pick from the space. Since the inception of the GST regime, cement has been placed in the highest tax slab of 28 percent, unlike other construction inputs such as metals, tiles, and sanitary ware, which are taxed at a relatively lower rate of 18 percent. Analysts at Choice Broking explained that moving cement into the 18 percent bracket could trigger a dual advantage. First, it would help boost consumption and, second, it would gradually improve capacity utilisation and pricing power of manufacturers. They projected industry demand, which has historically been in the range of 6-8 percent for FY27/FY28E, could rise to 8-10 percent under an 18 percent GST rate scenario. Additionally, they foresee a pricing tailwind of Rs 60-100 per tonne for FY27/28E. The brokerage also expects EBITDA per tonne to improve meaningfully. They estimated gains in the range of 15-25 percent for FY27/28E, with ACC, Birla Corporation, and JK Lakshmi Cement likely to emerge as the biggest beneficiaries, potentially offering an upside of as much as 30 percent in these counters. Stocks, MFs join the party In terms of stock performance, cement stocks have been among the top gainers of FY26. JK Cement has led the pack with a robust 50 percent rally, followed by Nuvoco Vistas, Star Cement, India Cements, and Ramco Cements, which gained between 20 percent and 45 percent. Among the larger players, however, performance was mixed: Ambuja Cements delivered a modest 8 percent return, while ACC slipped 6 percent. The sector has also drawn strong interest from domestic mutual funds. Data showed that 8 out of the top 10 cement companies saw an increase in mutual fund holdings during the June quarter compared with the same period last year, underlining institutional confidence in the space. Q1 performance gives cement its backbone The strength of the June quarter earnings has provided further validation. Nuvoco Vistas reported a stunning 4,589 percent year-on-year jump in PAT, reaching Rs 133 crore, driven by improved operational efficiencies and better price realisations. Star Cement delivered a 217 percent surge in profit. Ambuja Cements maintained its solid footing with 22.6 percent sales growth and 24 percent profit growth, while JK Cement continued its strong performance with 19.4 percent sales growth and an impressive 75 percent rise in PAT. At the top of the table, Ultratech Cement, the industry leader, posted the highest revenue at Rs 21,275 crore, with sales growth of 13 percent and a 49 percent jump in PAT to Rs 2,225 crore.

"As 'fairly valued' JSW Cement leverages group’s steel output, Motilal Oswal initiates coverage",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/as-fairly-valued-jsw-cement-leverages-group-s-steel-output-motilal-oswal-initiates-coverage-13466222.html,"Shares of recently-listed JSW Cement are higher by over 3 percent on August 19, with brokerage Motilal Oswal initiating coverage with a 'Neutral' rating with a target price of Rs 163 per share, calling the stock 'fairly valued'. The note projects an FY26 profit of around Rs 300 crore for JSW Cement, with a revenue CAGR of 19 percent over FY25-28, and EBITDA CAGR of 31 percent for the same period. Unlike other cement players that have dominance in the grey cement category, JSW Cement has a higher concentration of revenue and profit from ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), which is manufactured from slag, and is a byproduct of the steel-making process. Leveraging JSW Group’s presence in steel manufacturing, JSW Cement has emerged as the largest manufacturer of GGBS in India with a market share of close to 84 percent. Motilal Oswal said JSW Cement is 'well-positioned' to capitalize on the rising demand for GGBS, and is supported by long-term supply agreements for blast furnace slag. According to the MOSL note, GGBS made up around 34 percent of JSW Cement's total revenue for FY25, and its share in EBITDA was higher at 76 percent for FY25. The ongoing expansion plans at JSW Cement will soon see the company foray into the North region, where MOSL said profitability is 'better' compared to South India. ""It will also help JSW Cement reduce its capacity concentration in the South region to around 41 percent by FY28e from around 53 percent in FY25,"" said MOSL. However, this capex will keep the debt levels at JSW Cement elevated, said the note. ""We estimate a capex of Rs 5,600 crore during FY26-28e, which would be mainly for the Rajasthan integrated unit. The remaining capex will be used for a grinding unit of Shiva Cement, a greenfield unit in Punjab and brownfield capacity expansion in the south region,"" MOSL said. JSW Cement could see an improvement in its clinker-to-cement conversion for existing plants, along with higher-than-estimated GGBS volumes and better utilization for the North India plant, said MOSL, while pointing at a downside risk of lower trade volume, pricing pressure in South and delays in capacity commissioning in North India.

The Nifty Auto index advanced 1 percent, buiglding on Monday’s near 5 percent jump after reports that the government may cut GST on vehicles to spur demand. The rally also found support from fresh signals out of New Delhi. According to CNBC TV-18, China’s foreign minister, currently in India for meetings, has assured that Beijing will address key concerns flagged by New Delhi, including the supply of rare earth magnets — a critical input for automakers — and tunnel boring machines. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates For auto manufacturers, the rare earth issue has been particularly acute. China accounts for about 90 percent of global production and supply, and shortages have already disrupted output. Bajaj Auto slashed production of its electric two-wheelers by as much as 50 percent in July, warning that volumes in August and September will also remain constrained. Hero MotoCorp, on its Q1FY26 earnings call, admitted the shortage is an industry-wide challenge but said it has secured enough supplies to cover both its internal combustion engine and electric vehicle models through the second quarter of FY26. The company added that key components such as EV motors and engine and wheel sensors, which rely heavily on rare earth magnets, are covered for now, while it continues to explore long-term alternatives. Tata Motors, India’s largest EV player, has also flagged rare earth magnets as a potential choke point. While its production has not been hit yet, the company is already working on alternative supply options to secure future operations. If Beijing’s assurances materialise, automakers could find much-needed relief from supply disruptions that have threatened production schedules, even as domestic demand prospects brighten with talk of a potential GST cut. At about 10:55 am, the Nifty Auto index was up 1 percent, with the top gainers being Ola Electric, Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, Eicher Motors, Hyundai Motor India, and TVS Motor Company. The Nifty Auto index is up 11.21 percent since the beginning of the year.

During what is his first visit to India in three years, Wang Yi assured External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar that China is addressing India's needs related to fertilisers, CNBC-TV18 reported citing people familiar with the matter. He further assured that the Xi Jinping-led country will address India's concerns around rare earth magnets and tunnel boring machines, the report added. Another report said that China has already informed India that it is lifting export restrictions on fertilizers, rare earth magnets and tunnel boring machines. According to Economic Times, Yi told Jaishankar that the Chinese officials are working to remove the restrictions. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the reports. Agro Phos India shares jumped 5 percent to hit the upper circuit at Rs 38.92 apiece. Southern Petrochemicals and Zuari Agro Chemicals shares gained around 4 percent each.

India reportedly imports nearly 80 percent of its specialty fertilisers, such as water-soluble nutrients, liquid foliar feeds, slow- and controlled-release variants, and bio-stimulants, from China. The two foreign ministers met on August 18 in New Delhi, ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheduled visit to China to attend the annual summit of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). A statement by the Chinese foreign ministry said the country is ready to uphold the principle of cordiality and mutual benefit with India. Wang will also meet Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval to discuss the two countries’ border dispute before calling on Prime Minister Narendra Modi later on August 19.

"Reliance shares rise nearly 3% on Jio tariff changes, positive brokerage calls",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/reliance-shares-rise-over-2-on-tariff-changes-positive-brokerage-calls-13465905.html,"Reliance Industries shares rose nearly 3 percent in Tuesday’s trade after its Jio telecom unit announced changes in its prepaid tariffs. The gains were supported by upbeat brokerage commentary. On the NSE, RIL stock rose as much as 2.84 percent to Rs 1,421, extending gains into a second straight session. Reliance Jio has discontinued its entry-level 1GB per day prepaid packs priced at Rs 209 for 22 days and Rs 249 for 28 days. Following the revision, the effective entry plan now begins at Rs 299 for 1.5GB per day for 28 days, up from Rs 249 earlier. The move aligns Jio’s pricing with Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which already charge Rs 299 for similar 28-day plans. Brokerage IIFL said the Rs 249 pack contributed less than 10 percent to Jio’s mobile revenues, and the 20 percent hike could directly lift overall revenue by under 2 percent. Axis Capital, however, expects the tariff changes to boost Jio’s FY26E revenue and average revenue per user (ARPU) by 4-5 percent, reported CNBC-TV18. Morgan Stanley said that Jio has removed its popular Rs 249 plan (1GB per day for 28 days) and Rs 199 plan (1.5GB per day for 18 days). With this, the lowest-priced daily data option for 28 days now starts at Rs 299. Domestic brokerages reiterated a ‘Buy’ rating on Reliance with a target price of Rs 1,690. Citi said the SEBI proposal on large IPOs could have meaningful positive implications for a potential Jio listing. Jefferies maintained its ‘Buy’ call with a target price of Rs 1,670, citing improving cash flows in Jio, steady growth in retail and continued investments in renewables in the oil-to-chemicals business. As of 10:30 am, 2.21 lakh shares of Reliance Industries worth Rs 31.06 crore changed hands on the BSE. On the NSE, more than 45 lakh shares were traded till the time of publishing. The company’s market value stood at more than Rs 19.1 lakh crore, according to BSE data. Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

"Vardhman Textiles, Ambika Cotton Mills & other cotton stocks rally as Centre scraps import duty",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vardhman-textiles-ambika-cotton-mills-other-cotton-stocks-rally-as-centre-scraps-import-duty-13465764.html,"Shares of cotton-related companies such as Vardhman Textiles, Gokaldas Exports, Ambika Cotton Mills, and Welspun Living rallied in the range of 1 percent to 8 percent on August 19 after the Centre removed the 11 percent import duty on raw cotton till September 30. The Finance Ministry issued a notification through the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), removing both the basic customs duty and the Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess on cotton imports. The decision offers temporary relief to the textile and garment industry, which has been facing challenges amid concerns related to the Trump tariffs. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog This development comes after months of back-and-forth between the two countries. India has stood firm on sensitive sectors such as agriculture and dairy during bilateral trade talks. By easing duty on cotton, New Delhi is signaling some flexibility without giving up its core red lines. The government’s move is aimed at mitigating the pressure of a larger tariff of 50 percent imposed by the US government on Indian exports, the deadline for which is August 27. The exemption is expected to benefit the entire textile chain including yarn, fabric, garments, and made-ups. Meanwhile, the US negotiating team, which was scheduled to visit New Delhi for the sixth round of trade talks on August 25, has cancelled its visit. No fresh date has been announced so far. The move also reflects India’s domestic supply concerns. Cotton availability in the local market has been tight, with industry associations repeatedly warning about the risk of higher yarn prices and downstream cost pressures in textiles. By allowing duty-free imports, the government aims to ease raw material costs ahead of the festival season, a period when demand for garments typically rises.

The note, however, added that a trade deal between US and India could reduce these risks, even as India stares at an additional 25 percent levy over its oil imports from Russia, effective from August 27. For Indian pharma companies, US is a key export market, and tariff risk on these items is not yet fully factored in, said Fitch, and could pose downside risks to these businesses. The note cited Biocon's example, which derives around 40 percent of its sales from US through products mostly manufactured in India and Malaysia. ""The competitive industry landscape could limit Biocon’s ability to pass on higher costs, despite the non-discretionary demand for its products,"" Fitch said. For crop production chemical producer UPL, US buyers make up for 10-12 percent of total revenue, and any tariff on its products could potentially affect its competitiveness in the American market. However, UPL still has 'significant' geographical and product diversification, Fitch added, which could mean the company will still be able to meet EBITDA growth guidance of 10-14 percent in constant currency terms, though the risk remains. ""...we see limited risk to our EBITDA growth estimate of 11 percent (in US dollar terms) and leverage forecast for the financial year ending March 2026,"" Fitch added. While India's direct exports of automotives to the US are limited, America still accounts for close to 20 percent of sales for auto supplier Samvardhana Motherson (SAMIL). These are supplied mostly from US production bases or from Mexico, which has secured a tariff exemption under an agreement. Still, Fitch had revised its Outlook on SAMIL to Stable from Positive in May 2025. Fitch said it expects a weak global auto sector outlook owing to tariff-related uncertainty. Fitch has assumed a very minimal direct tariff impact on Indian IT services, along with those companies that are domestically focused. Oil and gas, cement, engineering and construction, telecom and utilities are at lower risk of a direct impact. Though if US tariffs stay significantly higher than Asian peers, Fitch said it sees a moderate downside risk to India's growth forecast for FY26, which would weigh on the operating performance of India Inc. ""India’s corporates could also be affected if US tariffs divert supply to other markets, including India, as this could present downside risks to our domestic price assumptions for some products, such as steel and chemicals,"" the note added.

Inox Wind shares gain 6% on Rs 175 crore stake sale in EPC subsidiary,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/inox-wind-shares-gains-6-on-rs-175-crore-stake-sale-in-epc-subsidiary-13465789.html,"Shares of Inox Wind rose as much as 6 percent to Rs 147.80 in morning deals on Tuesday after the company said it had divested a stake worth about Rs 175 crore in its subsidiary Inox Renewable Solutions Ltd. (IRSL). The company disclosed in a regulatory filing that it has signed agreements, last executed on August 18, to sell 49.6 lakh equity shares of IRSL, each with a face value of Rs 10. The transaction values the subsidiary at around Rs 7,400 crore, with the sale expected to be completed within the next seven days. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates IRSL, formerly known as Resco Global Wind Services, reported revenue of Rs 217.98 crore in FY25, contributing about 6 percent to Inox Wind’s consolidated revenue. Its net worth stood at Rs 935 crore, accounting for 14 percent of the parent’s consolidated net worth. Inox Wind’s consolidated profit after tax surged to Rs 105.8 crore in the June quarter, up from Rs 10.3 crore a year earlier, aided by higher other income and lower finance costs. Other income rose to Rs 36.3 crore from Rs 15.1 crore, while finance costs declined to Rs 33.8 crore from Rs 55.8 crore in the same period last year. Revenue for the quarter increased 29.2 percent to Rs 826.3 crore compared with Rs 639.6 crore in the year-ago period. The company’s EBITDA margin expanded to 22.2 percent from 21.1 percent a year earlier. Inox Wind also took a deferred tax charge of Rs 40 crore, with reversal of deferred tax assets already recognised in earlier years. Following Q1, Nuvama Institutional Equities cut its price target on the stock by 19 percent to Rs 190 from Rs 236. The brokerage, however, maintained its “buy” rating, noting that the revised target still implies an upside of around 39 percent from current levels. Nuvama highlighted that Inox Wind reported modest execution in the June quarter at 146 megawatts (MW) versus consensus estimates of 180 MW. Order intake during the quarter was soft at 51 MW, taking the order book to 3.1 GW with an execution horizon of more than 24 months. The brokerage has trimmed its FY26 and FY27 execution estimates to 1.1 GW and 1.8 GW, down from earlier projections of 1.2 GW and 2 GW, respectively. At about 10:10 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 146, higher by 5.6 percent from the last close on the NSE. Inox Wind shares are down 18.5 percent since the beginning of the year.

"Commercial vehicle outlook set to improve if GST, credit measures come through: Ashok Leyland",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/commercial-vehicle-outlook-set-to-improve-if-gst-credit-measures-come-through-ashok-leyland-13465599.html,"India’s commercial vehicle industry could be on the cusp of a turnaround if two policy measures fall into place — a reduction in Goods and Services Tax (GST) and easier access to credit. For Shenu Agarwal, managing director and chief executive of Ashok Leyland, these changes would not just lift sentiment but also trigger a sharp revival in demand, reshaping the growth path for FY26 and FY27. At present, commercial vehicles are taxed at 28 percent, among the highest rates in the GST structure. A cut to 18 percent, Agarwal told CNBC TV-18, would be a landmark shift. Lowering the tax burden would immediately reduce acquisition costs, encourage consumption, and ultimately generate more freight for the vehicles to carry. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The other critical piece, he added, lies in financing. With more than 90 percent of CV purchases funded by loans, industry participants are watching for Reserve Bank of India measures that could ease credit flow to the sector. A combination of these two steps, Agarwal believes, would provide an instant boost to demand by addressing the twin hurdles of high upfront costs and tight financing. Ashok Leyland’s own performance in the June quarter reflected resilience in a testing environment. The company expanded its market share across key categories, gaining 1.3 percent in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle segment, led by a 1.8 percent rise in trucks. The bus business, however, ceded ground as demand shifted towards fully built vehicles. In the light commercial vehicle category, too, Ashok Leyland added 1.2 percent market share. Exports jumped 29 percent year-on-year, but despite the strong start, Agarwal has kept the FY26 growth target unchanged at 20–25 percent, pointing out that the company’s key overseas markets have remained insulated from global disruptions. Looking to the second quarter, Agarwal expects support from a low base to lift performance. On the electric mobility front, he said operations at Switch India have been stabilised, putting the unit on course to turn PAT positive by the end of FY26 — a milestone in the group’s EV journey.

Agarwal expects the vertical to deliver 25–30 percent topline growth this fiscal, backed by both fresh and repeat demand. Following Q1, UBS reiterated a “buy” call on the stock with a target price of Rs 150, highlighting that the company delivered a margin beat on the back of operational discipline. The brokerage noted that medium and heavy commercial vehicle (MHCV) growth is expected in mid-single digits, while light commercial vehicle (LCV) growth could be slightly better. At about 9:25 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 128, lower by 3 percent as investors booked profit after a massive 7 percent rally in the previous session. Ashok Leyland shares are up 16 percent since the beginning of the year.
