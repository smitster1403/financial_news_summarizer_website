Buy Tata Consultancy Services; target of Rs 3880: LKP Research,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-tata-consultancy-services-target-of-rs-3880-lkp-research-13775344.html,"LKP Research's research report on Tata Consultancy Services Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) reported topline growth of +0.8% QoQ / -2.6% YoY CC, broadly in line with the historical trend of a seasonally weak Q3 due to furloughs and lower utilization. Performance was supported by international operations (+0.4% QoQ CC), primarily driven by strong growth in Latin America (+4.6% QoQ CC) and MEA (+3.2% QoQ CC). On the vertical front, Life Sciences & Healthcare (+0.9% QoQ CC) and CBG (+1.3% QoQ CC) maintained steady momentum, with CBG benefiting from strength in retail, travel, and hospitality across the Americas, Europe, and APA, notwithstanding continued softness in the UK. Manufacturing (+0.2% QoQ CC) posted marginal growth, as weakness in automotive was partially offset by improvement in other sub-segments. BFSI witnessed Q3 seasonalityled softness due to furloughs; however, management remains confident of a recovery, underpinned by healthy underlying deal traction. Outlook With the impact of the labour code largely behind, international business trends remaining stable, and a USD 1 bn equity partnership with TPG for AI data center infrastructure enhancing future deal visibility, we remain confident in TCS’s long-term fundamentals. Accordingly, we assign a BUY rating on TCS with a TP of ₹3,880, based on a valuation of 22x FY28E EPS.

Q3 results impact: Angel One shares jump 9% on strong sequential performance; Groww rises up to 9%,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/q3-results-impact-angel-one-shares-jump-9-on-strong-sequential-performance-groww-rises-up-to-9-13775236.html,"Angel One shares rose more than 8 percent on Friday, tracking the company’s strong sequential performance for the December quarter. On the National Stock Exchange (NSE), the stock climbed 8.16 percent to an intraday high of Rs 2,731.70. It opened the session with a gap-up gain of 2.48 percent. The stock has advanced for four consecutive sessions and is up nearly 17 percent over the period. The rally came after the company reported an 11 percent sequential increase in revenue, while net profit rose 27 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 269 crore. Broking orders during the quarter grew 6 percent quarter-on-quarter to 380 million, while revenue per broking order increased 5 percent to Rs 16. EBITDA margin stood at 39 percent, supporting broking revenues, JM Financial said in a note. While the period-end client funding book remained flat, the average client funding book grew 11 percent quarter-on-quarter, leading to strong interest income, the brokerage added. Angel One maintained its sequential growth momentum during the quarter, with a recovery in futures and options activity and a sharp rise in commodity trading offsetting the impact of market volatility on retail cash activity, according to Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited (MOFSL). Meanwhile, shares of Billionbrains Garage Ventures, the parent company of stockbroking platform Groww, rose as much as 9.4 percent to an intraday high of Rs 179.78. The stock has gained for the past two sessions and is up nearly 10 percent over the period. MOFSL said it has raised its FY27 and FY28 earnings per share estimates by 2 percent each, citing strong expansion in the margin trading facility book and a better-than-expected launch of the commodities segment. The brokerage maintained its ‘Buy’ rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 190. On a sequential basis, profit after tax grew 16 percent from Rs 471 crore reported in the September quarter. The year-on-year decline was largely due to a one-time post-tax gain of Rs 315 crore recorded in the year-ago period. Excluding this exceptional item, operating profit after tax rose 24 percent year-on-year to Rs 442 crore.

"LTIMindtree shares jump over 4% today after Rs 3,000-crore CBDT order win for AI-powered tax programme",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/ltimindtree-shares-jump-over-4-today-after-rs-3-000-crore-cbdt-order-win-for-ai-powered-tax-programme-13775251.html,"Shares of LTIMindtree rallied sharply on Friday, climbing more than 4 percent to hit the day’s high after the IT services company announced a large, long-tenure government order linked to India’s tax administration modernisation programme. LTIMindtree stock surged to a high of around Rs 6,290 in late-morning deals, up about 4.3 percent for the day. The rally pushed the stock to its session high and came amid strong volumes in the IT pack. At current levels, LTIMindtree commands a market capitalisation of about Rs 1.86 lakh crore. Even after Friday’s surge, the stock is up just under 5 percent over the past one year. It has underperforming the Nifty 50, which has gained around 11 percent over the same period. In a press release filed with the stock exchanges, the company said it has been awarded the Insight 2.0 project by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to build an AI-powered programme for the modernisation of India’s national tax analytics platform. The mandate is valued at around Rs 3,000 crore and spans seven years, providing long-term revenue visibility. The project will focus on deploying advanced digital architecture and data analytics. Investors appeared to react positively to both the size and duration of the deal, with the order reinforcing LTIMindtree’s credentials in the public sector. The long contract tenor was also seen as supportive for medium-term earnings visibility. Friday’s move in LTIMindtree also played out against a stronger backdrop for IT stocks more broadly. Buying interest picked up across the sector after Infosys stock surged more than 5 percent, its biggest single-day gain in about four months, following its Q3 FY26 results and an upward revision in revenue growth guidance. The improved sentiment triggered both fresh buying and short-covering in several IT names, lending additional support to LTIMindtree’s rally. From a valuation standpoint, LTIMindtree trades at a TTM price-to-earnings multiple of about 38.2, with a dividend yield of roughly 1 percent, metrics that have kept the stock in focus for investors assessing risk-reward after a period of relative underperformance versus the broader market.

L&T stock was trading 1.02 percent higher at Rs 3,905.4 in morning trade on NSE. At current levels, the stock is up about 11.3 percent over the past one year, broadly in line with the Nifty 50’s gains. The company commands a market capitalisation of around Rs 5.36 lakh crore. L&T stock trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of about 32.7 times. In an exchange filing on Friday, L&T said its hydrocarbon onshore business vertical has secured a large order from Petronet LNG, a joint venture promoted by ONGC, Indian Oil, GAIL and BPCL. The project will be executed on a lump-sum turnkey basis and involves engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning of LNG/ethane and propane double-wall storage tanks at the Dahej petrochemical complex in Gujarat. The scope of work includes a 170,000 cubic metre LNG/ethane storage tank and a 140,000 cubic metre propane storage tank, along with ethane and propane handling and despatch facilities to support the downstream propane dehydrogenation and polypropylene plant. L&T classified the contract as a ‘large’ order, implying a value in the range of Rs 2,500 crore to Rs 5,000 crore. The project forms part of India’s first petrochemical complex integrating cold energy utilisation from an LNG terminal and is aimed at strengthening domestic petrochemical manufacturing capacity. Friday’s order announcement comes after L&T earlier this week sought to reassure investors over reports related to possible cancellation of oil project tenders in Kuwait. The company had clarified that the projects referred to in those media reports were not part of its order book, following which the stock had pared intraday losses. L&T has also remained in focus in recent sessions after announcing another ‘large’ order earlier this week for its heavy civil infrastructure business, involving the construction of India’s largest pumped storage project in Maharashtra.

"Cipla stock crashes over 3% as brokerages cut targets on Lanreotide disruption, FY27 risks",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/cipla-stock-crashes-over-3-as-brokerages-cut-targets-on-lanreotide-disruption-fy27-risks-13775001.html,"Shares of Cipla Ltd fell sharply on Friday and extended recent weakness, after a series of cautious brokerage notes flagged earnings risks from supply disruptions in its key US product Lanreotide and intensifying competition in other generics. Cipla stock dropped 3.48 percent to Rs 1,384.6 in early trade. The stock is now down about 4 percent over the past one year, sharply underperforming the Nifty 50, which has risen over 10 percent during the same period. The decline comes after Cipla disclosed that manufacturing of Lanreotide has been temporarily paused to support USFDA remediation at its European contract manufacturing partner. Lanreotide is among Cipla’s top three products in the US and accounts for about $150 million in annual revenue, with the company holding a 22 percent market share in the product. Morgan Stanley maintained its Underweight stance on the stock and cut its target price to Rs 1,292 per share. The brokerage warned that the phase-out of gRevlimid and supply disruptions in Lanreotide are likely to weigh on performance, particularly in Q4 FY26. It trimmed earnings estimates by 2 percent for FY26 and 1 percent for FY27, cautioning that any prolonged disruption could result in market share loss and downside risk to FY27 and FY28 earnings. Nuvama also turned more cautious, downgrading Cipla to Reduce and lowering its target price to Rs 1,360 per share. Nuvama said the expiry of gRevlimid exclusivity, uncertainty around Lanreotide supplies, and rising competition for Cipla’s proposed generic Advair following a recent approval for Lannett pose an earnings challenge for FY27. The brokerage noted that Cipla’s European contract manufacturer Pharmathen has temporarily paused production for remediation, with manufacturing expected to restart only in the first half of FY27, adding near-term uncertainty. Cipla has said that the Lanreotide manufacturing halt is linked to remediation efforts following a US Food and Drug Administration inspection at Pharmathen’s Rodopi facility in Greece, which resulted in nine observations. The company has indicated that resupply of Lanreotide is expected to resume in the first half of FY27 and that it is closely monitoring supply levels. Not all brokerages are bearish. Nomura believes the potential loss of Lanreotide sales has largely been priced in, noting that the stock is already down about 6.5 percent since the issue first came to light earlier this month. Nomura has maintained a Buy rating with a target price of Rs 1,770. However, the dominant tone around Cipla remains cautious.

Infosys stock climbed 5.14 percent to a high or Rs 1,682.1 in early trade, marking a firm rebound after the company’s earnings announcement earlier this week. The stock had ended the previous session at Rs 1,608.9 on the NSE. The buying interest comes despite Infosys reporting a 2.2 percent year-on-year decline in consolidated net profit for the fiscal third quarter, which was weighed down by a one-time labour code-related charge. Investors appeared to look past the headline profit miss, focusing instead on steady constant-currency revenue growth, resilient adjusted margins, and robust large-deal momentum. Infosys raised its FY26 revenue growth guidance to 3-3.5 percent in constant currency terms, citing improving demand visibility and strong execution, while maintaining its operating margin outlook. Large deal wins stood at $4.8 billion during the quarter, including two mega deals, supporting medium-term revenue visibility. Sentiment was also supported by a sharp rally in Infosys’ American Depository Receipts, which jumped about 8 percent over two US trading sessions following the results, signalling a positive offshore investor response. Brokerages reiterated bullish views on the stock after the earnings announcement. CLSA maintained an ‘Outperform’ rating on Infosys with a target price of Rs 1,779 per share, while HSBC reiterated its ‘Buy’ call with a higher target price of Rs 1,870 per share, citing improving demand commentary, greater clarity on AI-led spending, and stabilising US corporate sentiment. Despite Friday’s sharp rebound, Infosys shares remain down about 13 percent over the past one year, underperforming the Nifty 50, which has risen more than 10 percent over the same period. Brokerages say that this has kept the stock firmly on investors' radar for a potential re-rating.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Hindustan Zinc, Punjab National Bank, Tata Steel, MCX India, Laurus Labs, and others on January 16?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-hindustan-zinc-punjab-national-bank-tata-steel-mcx-inida-laurus-labs-and-others-on-january-16-13774581.html,"Equity benchmarks recorded a one-third percent loss, continuing the downtrend for the second consecutive session on January 14, with moderately weakening market breadth. A total of 1,498 shares saw selling pressure compared to 1,385 shares that gained on the NSE. The market may remain range-bound until it decisively breaks the current week’s high–low range. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Nilesh Jain, Head – Technical and Derivatives Research Analyst (Equity Research) at Centrum Broking Hindustan Zinc | CMP: Rs 654.2 Hindustan Zinc continues to remain in a strong uptrend, consistently forming higher tops and higher bottoms. It is trading well above both short-term and long-term moving averages, indicating sustained strength. After witnessing consolidation over the past couple of weeks, the stock has now delivered a fresh breakout, which is supported by higher-than-average volumes, reinforcing the bullish outlook. From a derivatives perspective, the addition of fresh long positions further strengthens the positive bias. Considering the overall technical setup, the stock appears well-positioned to move towards the Rs 700 level in the near term, while crucial support is placed at Rs 621. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 700 Stop-Loss: Rs 621 Punjab National Bank | CMP: Rs 128.68 Punjab National Bank gave a fresh breakout from an ascending triangle pattern on the daily chart. It surpassed double-top resistance and ended at 52-week highs. The sharp price up-move is backed by significantly higher volumes, which validates the bullish setup. Momentum indicators are also supportive, with the RSI moving above the 65 mark and the MACD generating a bullish crossover, indicating improving upward momentum. Overall, the technical structure suggests the stock is well placed to move towards the Rs 140 level in the near term, while immediate support is seen near Rs 123. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 140 Stop-Loss: Rs 123 Polycab India | CMP: Rs 7,323.5 Polycab India earlier formed a double-top pattern and has since been making lower highs and lower lows, indicating a weakening price structure. It has also slipped below all its key short-term moving averages, reinforcing the bearish bias. Currently, the stock is on the verge of breaking down from its rising trendline, with immediate support placed near Rs 7,250. A decisive breach below this level could accelerate selling pressure and drag the stock towards the Rs 6,800 zone. The bearish outlook would be invalidated only if the stock manages to sustain a move above Rs 7,560 on the upside. From a derivatives perspective, the presence of fresh short build-up further supports the negative view. Considering the overall technical setup, the stock appears poised for a breakdown and is likely to drift towards the Rs 6,800 level in the near term. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 6,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 7,560 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities Tata Steel | CMP: Rs 189.25 The Nifty Metal index has been outperforming the frontline indices for the past few sessions, driven by strong buying interest in metal stocks. Tata Steel has delivered a significant technical breakout, forming a Cup and Handle pattern on the daily chart, which is considered a bullish continuation signal. This breakout is validated by robust volumes, adding conviction to the move. Currently, the stock is trading at an all-time high, and all major moving averages are positively aligned, reinforcing the bullish trend. Momentum indicators are also supportive, with the daily and weekly RSI firmly positioned in the super-bullish zone. The MACD remains above its zero line and signal line, while the histogram indicates strengthening upside momentum. Based on these technical factors, the stock is expected to maintain its upward trajectory. Accumulation is advised in the Rs 190–188 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 205 Stop-Loss: Rs 182 Bank of India | CMP: Rs 152.87 The Nifty PSU Bank index has shown remarkable strength, taking support near its 20-day EMA before staging a sharp rally. On Wednesday, the index marked a fresh all-time high, significantly outperforming the benchmark indices. Bank of India mirrored this strength, finding support in the Rs 143–142 zone, which coincides with the 34-day EMA and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of its prior rally. This confluence acted as a strong base, triggering a sharp rebound accompanied by higher volumes. The stock now trades above all key moving averages, and the daily RSI is firmly in the bullish zone, signalling strong momentum. These technical factors suggest continued upside potential. Accumulation is recommended in the Rs 153–151 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 163 Stop-Loss: Rs 147 Multi Commodity Exchange of India | CMP: Rs 2,417 MCX has been a consistent outperformer over the past few months, maintaining a clear uptrend characterized by a series of higher highs and higher lows. Technical indicators confirm strong trend strength, with the Average Directional Index (ADX) reading at 36.79 on the daily chart and 39.43 on the weekly chart, well above the 25 threshold, which signals a robust trend. The Directional Movement Index also supports the bullish outlook, while price action remains firmly above all key moving averages. These factors indicate that the stock is in a powerful uptrend with strong momentum. Accumulation is suggested in the Rs 2,420–2,400 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,590 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,330 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Laurus Labs | CMP: Rs 1,090.5 Laurus Labs has moved up over the last two trading sessions following the formation of a tweezers bottom reversal pattern on the daily timeframe. Additionally, the higher-top higher-bottom structure appears to be intact. The RSI is in a bullish crossover and is trending higher. The stock is likely to continue its recovery in the coming days. A stop-loss can be placed below Rs 1,060, while a long position may be considered with potential upside towards Rs 1,160. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,160 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,060 KEI Industries | CMP: Rs 4,384.6 Following a correction, KEI Industries has formed a bullish engulfing pattern on the daily chart, indicating a potential bullish reversal in price. Additionally, the stock has moved above the 20 EMA. Sentiment around the stock appears attractive after the recent decline. A long position can be considered with a stop-loss placed at Rs 4,270. On the higher end, a target can be set at Rs 4,700.

"Vishal Sikka warns of AI valuation gap, urges Indian IT to evolve",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/vishal-sikka-warns-of-ai-valuation-gap-urges-indian-it-to-evolve-alpha-article-13773914.html,"The current valuations in the artificial intelligence sector do not add up, creating a significant gap between capital expenditure and revenue generation, according to Vishal Sikka, founder and CEO of Vianai Systems. In an interview with CNBC TV18, Sikka -- former CEO of Infosys -- warned of a hype cycle, noting that the economics of the massive spending on AI infrastructure are not currently supported by revenues. Sikka explained the discrepancy by breaking down the numbers. He pointed out that while a company like Nvidia generates approximately $250 billion annually from its GPU sales, the total ecosystem spending, including CPUs, memory, and networking, swells this figure to about $750-$800 billion a year. To justify this expenditure over a four-year amortisation period, the industry would need to generate around $200 billion in new revenue. ""Where is the 200 billion? There is no 200 billion. OpenAI's revenue is 15 billion, something like that. And so there is a huge gap,"" Sikka stated. He questioned how long this gap would be funded, acknowledging that while one could call it a bubble, the current reality is that the economics ""don't add up to what has been spent."" Addressing the impact on India's information technology services sector, Sikka asserted that AI is already capable of effectively automating well-defined, structured activities such as software development, maintenance, and business process execution. This means a much smaller team equipped with AI can perform the work previously done by a larger group. He urged Indian IT companies to embrace this transformation, even if it leads to lower short-term economic gains. The key to navigating this shift, he advised, is for these firms to become software companies in addition to being services companies. ""It has to be your own software,"" he emphasized. By developing proprietary AI platforms, IT firms can retain value even as the number of billable hours for projects decreases. This necessitates a business model adjustment away from purely people-based pricing towards fixed-fee, outcome-based approaches that account for the value of the software itself. Looking at India's position in the global AI race, Sikka expressed strong optimism, citing the nation's ""demographic dividend."" He described AI as a powerful tool, much like others invented throughout human history, that can empower India's large, young, and educated population. ""The great mandate for us is how do we make all our people able to use these tools to build amazing things for themselves, for our country, but also for the world,"" he said. Sikka believes that if India can successfully equip its billion-strong population to use AI effectively, the country will thrive. Furthermore, Sikka called for greater participation in building foundational AI technologies within India. Dismissing the notion that the country has missed its opportunity, he compared the current stage of AI development to being in the ""first over of a T20 match."" He expressed a desire to see a great foundation model built in India and highlighted immense opportunities for innovation. Future advancements, according to Sikka, lie in creating vertical foundation models for specific industries like healthcare, models trained on India's diverse local languages, and sophisticated ""world models"" that can understand the physical world and activities specific to the Indian context, such as traffic patterns and infrastructure.","The current valuations in the artificial intelligence sector do not add up, creating a significant gap between capital expenditure and revenue generation, according to Vishal Sikka, founder and CEO of Vianai Systems.","Future advancements, according to Sikka, lie in creating vertical foundation models for specific industries like healthcare, models trained on India's diverse local languages, and sophisticated ""world models"" that can understand the physical world and activities specific to the Indian context, such as traffic patterns and infrastructure.","Addressing the impact on India's information technology services sector, Sikka asserted that AI is already capable of effectively automating well-defined, structured activities such as software development, maintenance, and business process execution.","Dismissing the notion that the country has missed its opportunity, he compared the current stage of AI development to being in the ""first over of a T20 match.""",negative,0.5167262554168701
"India must build its own AI foundational models, says Vishal Sikka",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/india-must-build-its-own-ai-foundational-models-says-vishal-sikka-alpha-article-13773915.html,"Vishal Sikka, founder & CEO of Vianai Systems, has called for India to urgently develop its own foundational artificial intelligence models to avoid becoming a passive consumer of technology built elsewhere. In an interview with CNBC TV18, Sikka -- former CEO of Infosys -- emphasised that India is too large and the stakes too high for the nation to be absent from any layer of the AI ecosystem. ""We have to be central to AI ... at every layer, in every aspect of AI,"" Sikka stated, ahead of the India AI impact summit scheduled for next month. He argued that India possesses the capability to use and deliver AI at scale and should showcase its innovation and entrepreneurial spirit to the world. He said India must build its own foundation models, develop tools and applications on top, and enable hundreds of millions to deploy them, which are the core underpinning for platforms like ChatGPT. The former Infosys CEO highlighted a critical skill gap as a major challenge, describing the current global situation as a ""tale of two cities."" He noted that out of eight billion people worldwide, only about two million can build AI applications. The number shrinks dramatically to a few hundred thousand who can deploy AI in production, and fewer than 25,000 people on the entire planet possess the skills to create a frontier-level foundational model. ""These are not skills that are pre-ordained by God for a chosen few people… we have to really make these skills much more pervasive,"" he said. To address this, Sikka, who is on the board of Stanford's AI center, revealed that the upcoming summit will feature faculty from the university who will teach attendees how to build their own foundational models, aiming to proliferate the skill of building foundation models, which he argued can be learned. Sikka outlined a twofold concern regarding India's AI readiness. The first is the urgency to expand the skill base of people who understand AI's capabilities and limitations. The second is the imminent disruptive effect on key industries, particularly the IT services sector. He pointed out that Large Language Models (LLMs) are ""unreasonably effective at writing software,"" posing a direct challenge to traditional software development and maintenance roles. ""We have a short window of time in which to transform from the previous way of doing things to an AI-led way of doing things,"" Sikka warned, framing it as the most important equation for the times ahead. He stressed that the disruption is not a future event but is already happening. To illustrate the magnitude of the shift, he shared an anecdote of a complex system that took 15 experts nine months to build being replicated by a single person in just 14 days using modern AI tools. ""It is not a matter of when is it coming. It is here already,"" he asserted. Reflecting on his early decision to back OpenAI with a donation in 2015, he recalled that allocating resources to high-reward, unconventional ideas like these often seem ‘crazy’ at first. He urged a focus on the future, questioning what current opportunities might be missed today that will seem obvious in 2035. For him, the most significant imminent transformation lies in the complete overhaul of the IT landscape driven by AI.","He said India must build its own foundation models, develop tools and applications on top, and enable hundreds of millions to deploy them, which are the core underpinning for platforms like ChatGPT.","To address this, Sikka, who is on the board of Stanford's AI center, revealed that the upcoming summit will feature faculty from the university who will teach attendees how to build their own foundational models, aiming to proliferate the skill of building foundation models, which he argued can be learned.","He urged a focus on the future, questioning what current opportunities might be missed today that will seem obvious in 2035.","To address this, Sikka, who is on the board of Stanford's AI center, revealed that the upcoming summit will feature faculty from the university who will teach attendees how to build their own foundational models, aiming to proliferate the skill of building foundation models, which he argued can be learned.",neutral,0.8189577460289001

"Chartist Talk: Ashish Kyal shares outlook for Vedanta, Union Bank, NALCO, MCX, Hindustan Copper, IndusInd Bank after sharp rally",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/chartist-talk-ashish-kyal-shares-outlook-for-vedanta-union-bank-nalco-mcx-hindustan-copper-indusind-bank-after-sharp-rally-13773715.html,"According to Ashish Kyal, the CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors, Hindustan Copper is currently approaching prior swing high of Rs 575 after taking a short breather. “Break above Rs 575 can extend the rally further towards Rs 600-650 levels,” he said in an interview to Moneycontrol. On NALCO, which gained 4.5% in last session, he is of view that as long as the stock does not see a close below prior day’s low, upside momentum is expected to continue with the upside targets of Rs 400 level or higher. He also shared his technical outlook on Union Ban of India, Vedanta, IndusInd Bank and MCX India after their strong rally in the recent session. On the Nifty 50, he feels Friday closing will decide trend for coming week and key levels to watch out for are 25,470 – 25,850 levels. Do you expect the Nifty 50 to break out of the 25,600–25,900 range of the past four days on the upside? Nifty since past 7 days has been failing to give a positive close above prior day’s high. Prices are witnessing selling pressure on upside and not able to cross above 25,850 on closing basis which is also high volume profile area. It will be important to see a close above this level by end of day on Friday which is next working day for upside breakout. On downside, any close below 25,470 by day-end will be sign of concern. Friday closing will decide trend for coming week and key levels to watch out for are 25,470 – 25,850 levels. The Bank Nifty has hovered around short-term moving averages over the last few days. Do you see the possibility of the banking index moving toward record highs rather than witnessing sharp selling pressure? Bank Nifty is holding 50 period EMA (Exponential moving average) and index is currently consolidating near the EMA support in between a range of 58,800-59,800. Consistent rally in PSU banks have limited downside movement in the Index. A break above 59,800 level can open doors for the targets of 60,400 followed by 61,000 levels. While a close below 58,800 can suggest that short term top has formed. Do you expect the record-high rally to continue in Vedanta, Union Bank of India, and MCX India? Vedanta has hit record highs on strong rise in commodity prices. However, after a 13% rally since January 2026, RSI is overbought, so dips can be used to buy as long as there is no close below the prior day’s low, with upside targets of Rs 730 or higher over the coming months. PSU banks continued to outperform. In the previous session, Union Bank of India surged nearly 8% post good quarterly results, forming a strong bullish candle for the first time in months. As long as the stock holds above Rs 165 level, the bias remains positive for upside targets of Rs 190 level or higher. Since September, Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX India) has been protecting prior week’s low on closing basis keeping bigger trend on sides of bulls. So, as long as key support of Rs 2,180 level remains protected on the downside one can use every decline to buy with the upside target of Rs 2,600 followed by Rs 2,800 level. Are you super bullish on Hindustan Copper and NALCO? Global uncertainties have caused huge rally in commodities such as gold, silver, aluminium, and copper to reach all-time high levels. Hindustan copper and NALCO which are directly linked to these metals, so both companies are directly benefitting from this rally. Hindustan Copper is currently approaching prior swing high of Rs 575 after taking a short breather and now a break above the same can extend the rally further towards Rs 600-650 levels with Rs 540 followed Rs 520 as immediate support levels. While NALCO is currently trading at the uncharted territory and has shown a sharp rally of nearly 13% within past one week. For now, as long as we do not see a close below prior day’s low, upside momentum is expected to continue with the upside targets of Rs 400 level or higher. On the downside, Rs 350 can act as an immediate support. Any break below it can result into short term profit booking. Do you think the Nifty Auto index is done with its correction and is expected to resume its upward journey soon? Nifty Auto index has lost most of its gains from recent rally and continued to drift lower by protecting prior day’s high on closing basis. The sector is currently standing at 50 EMA support of 27,700 level. A close below the same can accelerate further selling pressure towards 27,480 followed by 27,180 level. On the upside, a break above 28,180 can trigger short covering. Do you see a cup-and-handle pattern breakout in IndusInd Bank? If yes, does it indicate that the rally will continue? Yes, on the daily chart, IndusInd Bank has confirmed a breakout from a cup-and-handle pattern, followed by a successful retest, and has also moved above its prior swing high. Notably, volumes have picked up sharply for the first time since November 12, 2025, indicating strong participation and conviction in the ongoing move. As long as Rs 890 level remains protected on the downside, the rally is likely to extend further towards Rs 1,000 or higher. Do you expect the record-high rally to continue in the Nifty PSU Bank index? Since past one year, PSU Bank index has shown a clear outperformance as compared to Private Bank as it has surged by 30% in one year and continued to trade in a uncharted territory. This strong relative momentum suggests that the outperformance trend is likely to persist. On the upside, the index has the potential to move towards 9,000, followed by 9,200 levels, while 8,650 level remains a crucial support to watch.",Hindustan Copper is currently approaching prior swing high of Rs 575 after taking a short breather and now a break above the same can extend the rally further towards Rs 600-650 levels with Rs 540 followed Rs 520 as immediate support levels.,"On NALCO, which gained 4.5% in last session, he is of view that as long as the stock does not see a close below prior day’s low, upside momentum is expected to continue with the upside targets of Rs 400 level or higher.",Nifty Auto index has lost most of its gains from recent rally and continued to drift lower by protecting prior day’s high on closing basis.,"On NALCO, which gained 4.5% in last session, he is of view that as long as the stock does not see a close below prior day’s low, upside momentum is expected to continue with the upside targets of Rs 400 level or higher.",positive,0.9047977328300476

The Nifty ended 67 points lower, while the Sensex was down by 245 points. Among sectors, Metal and PSU Bank indices rallied over 2 percent, whereas the IT index lost the most, shedding over 1 percent. Technically, after a muted open, the market registered narrow-range activity. On the lower side, it found support near 25,600/83200, while intraday profit booking was seen near 25,800/83800. We are of the view that the intraday market texture is non-directional; perhaps traders are waiting for either side to breakout. On the higher side, above 25,800/83800, the market could move up to 25,880-25,900/84000-84200. On the flip side, below 25,600/83200, selling pressure is likely to accelerate. If it falls below this level, it could retest the levels of 25,500-25,450/83000-82800. Gaurav Garg, Lemonn Markets Desk The benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty witnessed sharp intraday volatility on Wednesday as caution prevailed amid sustained foreign fund outflows and global tariff-related concerns. After slipping to early lows, domestic markets pared most of their losses on the back of selective value buying and traded largely flat by mid-afternoon. The Sensex fell to a low of 83,185.20 before recovering nearly 350 points to trade at 83,505.56, down 0.15 percent, while the Nifty hovered near the 25,700 level at 25,692.30, lower by 0.16 percent. Buying interest emerged in pockets such as metals, oil and gas, and consumer durables, helping limit the downside after recent corrections. Market sentiment remains fragile, with both indices having declined in six of the last seven sessions amid concerns over US tariff measures, geopolitical tensions and persistent foreign portfolio outflows. FPIs have sold nearly ₹16,600 crore worth of equities so far in January, following heavy outflows in 2025. Additional volatility was driven by the advancement of the weekly derivatives expiry to Wednesday, while positive cues from Asian markets provided some support. From a technical perspective, the Nifty managed to hold above the 25,620–25,715 support zone. A sustained move above 25,715 could trigger a recovery towards 26,020, while a break below 25,600 may open the downside towards 25,300.

L&T shares extend fall as JM Financial trims firm's order inflow forecast on $8.7-bn Kuwait tender uncertainty,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/l-t-shares-extend-fall-as-jm-financial-trims-firm-s-order-inflow-forecast-on-8-7-bn-kuwait-tender-uncertainty-13772675.html,"JM Financial issued a cautious note for Larsen & Toubro (L&T), stating that the uncertainty around Kuwait reportedly cancelling a few tenders can cloud order inflow visibility for the engineering major. The shares of the company extended decline for the fifth consecutive session on January 14. Kuwait mulls cancellation of oil project tenders worth $8.7 bn, says report: Kuwait is discussing plans to cancel oil project tenders worth $8.7 billion, media company MEED reported citing people familiar with the matter. It added that Kuwait's discussions come after bids for several contracts came in well above the budget, raising concerns over cost efficiency and fiscal impact. According to analysts quoted by CNBC-TV18, L&T was the lowest bidder in tenders worth more than $4.5 billion. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. L&T clarifies: The company clarified that the said that the projects referred to in the media reports were not part of the company’s order book. ""Further, the Company can’t comment on the status of tenders or commercial decisions of its Clients,"" it added. JM Financial on L&T: In its note, JM Financial said it has noted earlier that L&T is well-placed in $5-billion worth of tenders in Kuwait. Thus, any potential delay or cancellation of these bids may adversely impact its order inflows, the domestic brokerage said. It still expects L&T to meet its FY26 order inflow growth guidance of 10 percent YoY due to the firm’s April-December order inflows of Rs 3.2 trillion and strong prospects for Q4 FY26. However, it cut its core order inflow estimates by 5-6 percent for FY26-28 to account for possible delay/cancellation in the Kuwait tenders. “This leads to ~3% cut in our core FY28E EBITDA; thus, a 3% fall in the stock price on 13th Jan’26 largely factors in such a deferral,” the brokerage said. Notably, the stock fell as much as 4.5 percent on November 13, before recovering some losses. JM Financial maintained its ‘Buy’ rating for the stock with a target price of Rs 4,500 per share, implying an upside potential of nearly 16 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. L&T share price: L&T shares fell 0.6 percent to trade at Rs 3,863.90 apiece, as seen at 1.20 pm. The stock has fallen around 7 percent in the past five days, and nearly 6 percent in the past one month. It however increased 11 percent in the past six months, and 12 percent in the past one year.

Real estate stocks fall for 7th straight day: Analysts say D-Street is factoring in a likely slump due to IT layoffs,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/real-estate-stocks-fall-for-7th-straight-day-analysts-say-d-street-is-factoring-in-a-slump-due-to-it-layoffs-13772416.html,"The shares of real estate companies dropped in trade on January 14, recording a decline for the seventh consecutive session. Analysts have collectively highlighted how sustained IT layoffs may continue to impact the sector, and what lies ahead. The sharp fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty Realty index down around 1.7 percent to hit a near nine-month low of 843.60 in the morning trading hours of Wednesday. The sectoral index fell a combined 8% in the last seven trading sessions. Top realty losers today: Signatureglobal (India) shares dropped over 2 percent, while Prestige Estates shares fell around 2 percent. Macrotech Developers (Lodha), Brigade Enterprises and Phoenix Mills shares fell more than 1 percent each on January 14. Anant Raj and Godrej Properties shares fell around 1 percent each, while Sobha shares were down in the red with marginal losses. Bucking the trend, Oberoi Realty and DLF shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. Are IT layoffs behind the downturn? Indian IT sector has seen mass layoffs last year, which have now spilled over to this year. In July last year, Moneycontrol exclusively reported that the IT behemoth Tata Consultancy Services will be letting go of 2 percent of its workforce, or roughly over 12,000 employees, over 2026, in a bid to become more agile and future-ready amid rapid disruptions in technology. India’s largest IT services company on January 12 said that it has released 6,000 employees in Q2, and around 1,800 employees in December quarter. HCLTech, which also released its Q3 results on January 12, reported a net reduction of 261 employees during the quarter, taking its total employee base to 2,26,379 at the end of the December. However, the company didn't mention how many of these employees voluntarily exited and how many were laid off. According to analysts, the IT layoffs have impacted housing demand in key areas, thereby impacting the stocks. IT layoffs are likely to be the major reason for the low demand in the luxury segment of urban centers like Bangalore and Hyderabad as they will be discouraging the high-income buyers, said Shashank Gupta, Director, RPS Group. He added that mid-to-premium housing sales, which have already dropped 15 percent year-on-year, will continue to be affected negatively as the professionals will not be willing to upgrade, opting instead to rent amid such job uncertainties. ""The market has whispered to the executives with Nifty Realty down by 20% from the peaks and talking about the disruption posed by the AI, which also indicates that 30% of the IT jobs that are luxury demand would get stifled due to the automation by 2027. The stock corrections that are expected to be around 5-7% are dependent on the RBI rate cuts and policy revamps that could fuel the market by the second quarter of 2026,"" the analyst said. Keshav Mangla, GM Business Development at Forteasia Realty, cited Anarock data to explain that financial tech layoffs of more than 1 lakh since 2024 have already resulted in a 12 percent drop in the demand for Tier-1 cities, thus resulting in developers' difficulties in managing cash flows and having to sell off their inventory. 'A double-edged sword for real estate stocks': ""The stock market does not seem to be giving enough attention to the AI threat; the tools for generative AI are expected to take away 20-25% of the coding jobs which can bring down the HNI investments that are responsible for 30% of luxury property launches,"" Mangla said. The continuous IT layoffs, which are expected to reach 2,00,000 by FY27, are a double-edged sword for real estate stocks which are currently at multi-month lows, said Anurag Goel, Director, Goel Ganga Developments. He explained that this was because the IT layoffs will cause a further reduction in purchasing power in the markets relying mostly on IT where 35 percent of home loans are taken out. What is in store for the future? ""The lowest ever prices for Brigade and Sobha indicate the investors' fears about the prolonged sales stagnation, as the number of launches in Q3 2025 has declined by 18%. The stock market is taking into account the AI risks only to a certain extent since companies like Infosys that are hyperscalers are moving towards automating and thus, displacing the mid-level talent and consequently, the demand for flats costing Rs 10 lakh-Rs 30 lakh is being affected,"" Goel said. ""A slight hopefulness,"" said Goel while speaking about what lies ahead. However, he expects the real estate stocks to decline by another 8 to 10 percent more in the absence of a stimulus. Is there a silver lining? While headlines around IT layoffs and AI-led efficiency gains have raised concerns, the market is already discounting a slowdown in incremental office demand rather than a collapse, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head, INVasset PMS. ""AI is more a productivity lever than a demand destroyer at this stage. It may change how space is used, but it does not eliminate the need for physical offices, especially in collaborative and client-facing roles,"" Dasani explained. He added that residential demand remains supported by stable employment outside pure tech, improving balance sheets, and low speculative supply. ""Near-term consolidation is possible, but structurally, the sector is adjusting—not breaking,"" the analyst said.

The sharp uptick in Transportation is a combination of ramp up in anchor account along with a spending recovery in strategic top accounts, ex-top 10 accounts declined 7.5% in USD. The OEMs’ participation is inclined towards costs savings instead of focusing on the innovation and growth areas. The M&C and H&L performance was discouraging and reported third consecutive quarters of decline. We believe the underlying spending pattern within M&C and H&L is sporadic, attributed to the structural issues, and would require couple of more quarters to achieve a steady state. The management was confident of reviving growth within these two verticals on the back of new logo additions and few closures that concluded in Q3. On margin, it exceeded our estimate by 140bps QoQ. At the current margin, the utilization stood at ~75%, it aspires to achieve 85% utilization with a combination of deploying automation and AI.

Did Kotak Mahindra Bank stock really crash 80 percent today? Here’s why investors must not worry,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/did-kotak-mahindra-bank-stock-really-crash-80-percent-today-here-s-why-investors-must-not-worry-13772245.html,"Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank appeared to plunge more than 80 percent on Wednesday, January 14. However, the dramatic fall is entirely optical and linked to the bank’s 5:1 stock split, which came into effect today. Kotak Mahindra Bank shares are trading ex-split today, with the face value reduced to Re 1 per share from Rs 5. As part of the corporate action, one existing equity share has been sub-divided into five equity shares, with the stock price adjusting proportionately. Why Kotak Mahindra Bank stock shows 80 percent fall, and where it really stands On platforms that do not automatically adjust historical prices for the split, the stock appears to be down nearly 80 percent. This is simply the mathematical adjustment from the pre-split price to the post-split price, not a sell-off. Once adjusted for the split, Kotak Mahindra Bank stock was trading around Rs 419-420, down about 1.6 percent on the day. On a split-adjusted basis, Kotak Mahindra Bank shares are trading comfortably within their recent range, with a 52-week low of about Rs 346 and a high near Rs 460. The bank’s market capitalisation, adjusted for the split, is around Rs 83,500 crore, and the stock is up over 9 percent over the past one year. What happens to investors’ shares in their demat accounts For shareholders, the split does not change the value of their investment. Instead, it changes the number of shares held and the price per share. If an investor held 1 share of Kotak Mahindra Bank before the split, that holding automatically becomes 5 shares in the demat account after the record date. Correspondingly, the share price adjusts to roughly one-fifth of the earlier level. The total investment value remains the same, barring normal market fluctuations. No action is required from investors. The additional shares are credited automatically to demat accounts, and the revised quantity becomes visible once the corporate action is fully processed by the depositories. The split is primarily aimed at improving liquidity and affordability, making the stock more accessible to a wider set of retail investors without altering fundamentals. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s stock split history This is not the first time the lender has split its shares: January 14, 2026: Face value reduced from Rs 5 to Re 1 (5:1 split)September 13, 2010: Face value reduced from Rs 10 to Rs 5 (2:1 split) In both instances, the objective was to enhance trading liquidity and broaden investor participation, without impacting the underlying valuation. Kotak Mahindra Bank stock call: ‘Buy’ Separately, brokerage commentary on Kotak Mahindra Bank shares continues to be driven by medium-term fundamentals rather than today’s corporate action. An HDFC Securities institutional research report this week maintained a constructive view on the lender’s stock. The report pointed to steady growth prospects, improving deposit quality, and resilient profitability, even as the bank navigates trade-offs between growth, margins, and asset quality. The brokerage reiterated a ‘Buy’ stance with a sum-of-the-parts target price of Rs 2,500 (pre-split), reflecting confidence in the franchise despite sector-wide challenges.

"Asian shares post small gain, Yen weakens past 159",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-shares-post-small-gain-yen-weakens-past-159-13771713.html,"Asian shares posted a modest gain at the open, while Japanese equities extended their record-breaking run fueled by a weaker yen. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average advanced 0.9%, with the Japanese currency slipping past the 159-per-dollar level to the weakest since July 2024. Stocks in the country have jumped and the currency fallen amid reports of a snap election. Shares in South Korea edged up, having posted a gain on every trading day of 2026. In Tuesday’s US session, the S&P 500 fell from an all-time high, as JPMorgan Chase & Co. led a slide in lenders after its investment-banking fees missed guidance. US benchmarks dropped after December inflation data did little to dent expectations that the Federal Reserve will pause interest-rate cuts. Traders are going into Wednesday awaiting a possible US Supreme Court ruling on President Donald Trump’s global tariffs that were announced in April. Meanwhile, the cooler-than-expected US consumer price index reading reinforced bond traders’ expectations that the Fed will wait until mid-year to cut rates. Even after Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his board lowered the benchmark three times last year, money markets have continued to project the next reduction only in mid-2026. “The initial excitement sparked by a cooler-than-anticipated core CPI was short-lived,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers. “The reversal was influenced, in part, by the report’s failure to pull forward the next expected rate reduction from June to April, as fixed-income watchers project Powell’s December cut will be his last at the helm.” Following JPMorgan’s results Tuesday, earnings from megabank rivals Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are slated for Wednesday and Thursday. The group is expected to post its second-highest annual profit ever, boosted by Trump’s policy changes. Traders also are mindful of the potential for a US Supreme Court ruling Wednesday on tariffs the White House has been enforcing. An adverse ruling could draw a negative market reaction, even as the administration has alternative legal avenues for most of the levies. Elsewhere, Brent crude notched its biggest four-day gain since June as Trump ramped up rhetoric on Iran, while silver also extended its recent rally to cap its best three-day streak on record. Attention in Asia will once again be on Japan, where Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s reported plan for a snap election fueled a rally in stocks while pushing down bonds and driving the yen deeper into the intervention-risk zone. Japanese five-year yields rose to 1.615%, the highest since the tenor’s 2000 debut. Success at the polls for Takaichi, who ascended to the premiership in October, would provide a mandate for her to continue hawkish diplomacy and pro-stimulus policies. Back to the US inflation data, the December core CPI, excluding the often volatile food and energy categories, increased 0.2% from November. On an annual basis, it advanced 2.6%, matching a four-year low. The reading is perhaps a more convincing sign that inflation is on a downward path, since a number of caveats in November’s report contributed to a significant pullback in the annual core CPI. “Given the quirks of November’s dual-month report, it’s surprising not to see more numerous large month-over-month readjustments,” said Stephen Kates at Bankrate. “Consumers can breathe a sigh of relief that we didn’t snap back to the 3% annual inflation rate. Although today’s reading doesn’t demonstrate additional progress for inflation, it doesn’t take a step backwards either.”","“The reversal was influenced, in part, by the report’s failure to pull forward the next expected rate reduction from June to April, as fixed-income watchers project Powell’s December cut will be his last at the helm.” Following JPMorgan’s results Tuesday, earnings from megabank rivals Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are slated for Wednesday and Thursday.","“The reversal was influenced, in part, by the report’s failure to pull forward the next expected rate reduction from June to April, as fixed-income watchers project Powell’s December cut will be his last at the helm.” Following JPMorgan’s results Tuesday, earnings from megabank rivals Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are slated for Wednesday and Thursday.",Traders are going into Wednesday awaiting a possible US Supreme Court ruling on President Donald Trump’s global tariffs that were announced in April.,"“The reversal was influenced, in part, by the report’s failure to pull forward the next expected rate reduction from June to April, as fixed-income watchers project Powell’s December cut will be his last at the helm.” Following JPMorgan’s results Tuesday, earnings from megabank rivals Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are slated for Wednesday and Thursday.",negative,0.9414217472076416
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade TVS Motor, Union Bank of India, Dredging Corporation, Tech Mahindra, ICICI Bank, and others on January 14?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-tvs-motor-union-bank-of-india-dredging-corporation-tech-mahindra-icici-bank-and-others-on-january-14-13771690.html,"The benchmark indices gave up some of the previous day’s gains, with the Nifty 50 declining 0.22 percent on January 13. Market breadth was moderately weak, with about 1,491 shares declining against 1,370 advancing shares on the NSE. The market may see consolidation as long as it trades below the midline of the Bollinger Bands. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities TVS Motor Company | CMP: Rs 3,755.4 After declining from higher levels, TVS Motor rebounded from its retracement zone and witnessed a robust recovery. Additionally, on the intraday charts, the stock has given a breakout from its sloping trendline. The upward move in the stock suggests a new leg of a bullish trend from current levels. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 3,620 could be the trend-decider level for bulls. If the stock sustains above this level, a further uptrend towards Rs 4,010 can be expected. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,010 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,620 Jindal Steel | CMP: Rs 1,010.8 After a remarkable up move on the daily chart, Jindal Steel witnessed profit booking at higher levels. Following the recent sell-off, the downward momentum in the stock has stalled. Moreover, the stock has found support near its demand zone. This formation suggests a revival of the uptrend from current levels in the near future. For positional traders, Rs 980 would be the decisive level. If the stock trades above this level, the uptrend is likely to continue towards Rs 1,080. However, if it closes below Rs 980, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,080 Stop-Loss: Rs 980 Union Bank of India | CMP: Rs 166.19 Following its strong up move and a brief consolidation over the last few sessions, Union Bank of India is gaining further traction for a fresh up move. The chart structure indicates a bullish continuation pattern, which is likely to persist in the near term. As long as the stock trades above Rs 161, the bullish bias is likely to continue, with an upside target of Rs 178. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 178 Stop-Loss: Rs 161 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO at Waves Strategy Advisors Dredging Corporation of India | CMP: Rs 1,105 On the daily chart, Dredging Corporation of India has been trading in a broad consolidation range of Rs 892–1,071 over the past few weeks, indicating an accumulation phase. In the previous session, the stock finally gave a range breakout and managed to close above the range at Rs 1,105. This move was supported by a strong rise in volumes, adding credibility to the breakout. Additionally, the MACD has witnessed a bullish crossover for the first time since December 2025, which is a positive sign. For now, any dips towards Rs 1,070–1,075 can be considered a buying opportunity for an upside move towards Rs 1,150. On the downside, the Rs 1,020 level is expected to act as a crucial support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,150 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,020 Tech Mahindra | CMP: 1,614.8 On the daily chart, Tech Mahindra has been moving within a larger triangle pattern since the beginning of December 2024 and is now trading close to the trendline resistance. At the start of this week, the stock found support at the 50-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and witnessed a sharp rebound, forming higher highs and higher lows, which signals an improving price structure. For now, a break above Rs 1,635 can confirm a breakout from the triangle pattern, potentially resulting in a fresh rally towards Rs 1,750–1,800, as long as the EMA support near Rs 1,558 remains protected on the downside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,750, Rs 1,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,558 ICICI Bank | CMP: Rs 1,437 At the start of the month, ICICI Bank confirmed a breakout from a double-bottom pattern and has successfully retested the breakout zone. The stock is now trading near its prior swing high of Rs 1,442, indicating sustained strength. Over the past two sessions, prices have consistently protected the previous day’s low on a closing basis, which is a positive sign. Additionally, the Know Sure Thing (KST) indicator has already given a bullish crossover and is now trading above the zero line, suggesting that positive momentum is likely to continue. A decisive break above the Rs 1,442 level is required for bullish momentum to extend, which could push prices higher towards Rs 1,540, while Rs 1,390 is expected to act as the nearest support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,540 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,390","A decisive break above the Rs 1,442 level is required for bullish momentum to extend, which could push prices higher towards Rs 1,540, while Rs 1,390 is expected to act as the nearest support.","Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,080 Stop-Loss: Rs 980 Union Bank of India | CMP: Rs 166.19 Following its strong up move and a brief consolidation over the last few sessions, Union Bank of India is gaining further traction for a fresh up move.","Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities TVS Motor Company | CMP: Rs 3,755.4 After declining from higher levels, TVS Motor rebounded from its retracement zone and witnessed a robust recovery.","Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,750, Rs 1,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,558 ICICI Bank | CMP: Rs 1,437 At the start of the month, ICICI Bank confirmed a breakout from a double-bottom pattern and has successfully retested the breakout zone.",positive,0.912490963935852

The rare, fatal genetic disorder affects copper absorption and transport, leaving patients with severe neurological symptoms and a life expectancy of less than three years without treatment. The approval marks a milestone for Zydus Lifesciences, positioning the group in the rare disease space with a therapy that addresses a critical unmet need. “For the first time, patients have access to an approved therapy, offering hope where no options existed,” said Dr. Sharvil Patel, Managing Director of Zydus Lifesciences. ZYCUBO, a subcutaneous injectable formulation, restores copper homeostasis in pediatric patients. Clinical trials showed early treatment reduced the risk of death by nearly 80 percent compared to untreated controls, with median overall survival reaching 177 months versus 17.6 months for untreated patients. The USFDA granted ZYCUBO multiple designations, including breakthrough therapy, Fast Track, and Orphan Drug status. Sentynl acquired the asset from Cyprium Therapeutics in 2023 and advanced it through pivotal studies. The therapy also holds Orphan Designation in Europe. What is Menkes disease? Menkes disease, an X-linked recessive disorder caused by ATP7A gene mutations, has an estimated birth prevalence as high as 1 in 8,664 live male births. Untreated patients typically die by age three. ZYCUBO is not indicated for Occipital Horn Syndrome. The approval underscores Zydus Lifesciences’ push into innovation-led therapies beyond its generics base. The company employs 29,000 globally and aims to expand its rare disease portfolio through Sentynl’s U.S. platform.","Sentynl Therapeutics, a U.S.-based subsidiary of Zydus Lifesciences, has secured USFDA approval for ZYCUBO (copper histidinate), the first and only treatment for Menkes disease in the United States.","Sentynl Therapeutics, a U.S.-based subsidiary of Zydus Lifesciences, has secured USFDA approval for ZYCUBO (copper histidinate), the first and only treatment for Menkes disease in the United States.","“For the first time, patients have access to an approved therapy, offering hope where no options existed,” said Dr. Sharvil Patel, Managing Director of Zydus Lifesciences.","Sentynl Therapeutics, a U.S.-based subsidiary of Zydus Lifesciences, has secured USFDA approval for ZYCUBO (copper histidinate), the first and only treatment for Menkes disease in the United States.",positive,0.9139304161071777
'President Trump doesn’t impact my investing cycle': Raamdeo Agrawal explains why,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/president-trump-doesn-t-impact-my-investing-cycle-raamdeo-agrawal-explains-why-13771306.html,"As Donald Trump's incessant tariff flipflops continue to impact markets globally, ace market expert and Motilal Oswal Group Chairman Raamdeo Agrawal said that the US President's decisions don't impact his investments. While speaking at CNBC TV18 Market Forum event ""The Alpha Generators for 2026"", Agrawal acknowledged that Trump's decisions do have an impact on the world because the world has become very interdependent due to the multi-lateral globalisation. ""On one side Trump is happening, and on the other side, AI is happening. I don't know how to figure out which one will impact how much. So, I am very happy that I am in India. I do things that I understand, and you need to have a view on four-five things and find ideas out of it,"" he said. Entrepreneurs or magicians? On being asked if such macro uncertainties can pose a threat to valuation, Agrawal said equity is a very ""exotic"" asset class. ""Equity has a huge power to take in a lot of uncertainty, and yet, there are few entrepreneurs who can act like a magician and navigate all kinds of risks. We have to find them, who can navigate such hard times and deliver earnings,"" the market analyst added. Agrawal further said that AI may have reduced the terminal value of Indian IT sector from what it was five year back. However, the analyst took the example of Yoga to explain the fast adoption of AI in India. “Yoga was discovered in India. However, people in US and other countries practice it more than us now. Similarly, AI was established in US or China, but we are the fastest and biggest adopter of AI,” he said, adding that Indian IT services companies will deliver the highest number of AI agents. How will markets perform in 2026? After nearly muted returns in 2025, the market expert expects 2026 to see better performance from the markets as the earnings cycle is turning after a brief lull over the past four-five quarters. He noted that the government is also trying its best to support the economy through various measures, including GST rationalization. Agrawal sees GDP recovery over the next 12 months, which in turn will boost earnings and subsequently markets. Which sectors will outperform? ""Large caps have better chances to perform well in the markets, than midcaps and smallcaps. PSUs still have lot of steam. They are much more reasonably valued than the private sector, and earnings growth is almost 2x higher than the private sector,"" the analyst said. He was also very optimistic about the auto sector, and said investors should buy auto ETFs. Also read: Will markets see a pre-Budget rally?

After closing 2024 at 23,644.80, Nifty 50 hit the month's high at 23,689.50 on January 9, 2025, marking only a marginal increase from December 31, 2024 closing level. Overall, the index ended January 2025 with slight losses before Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented Union Budget 2025 on February 1. Sensex too more or less mirrored Nifty’s performance during the month, falling 0.8 percent in January 2025 before the Budget presentation. ""Historical trends indicate that the Indian market typically underperforms in January preceding a budget, with the Nifty falling in four of the last five years due to profit-booking and policy uncertainty. Current indicators reinforce this cautious outlook,” said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart. Will markets rally ahead of Budget 2026? The pre-Budget periods are characterised by higher levels of market volatility and not the usual straight-line move to the higher side, as the market tries to price in its views on fiscal spending, said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara. Swapnil Aggarwal, Director at VSRK Capital, also said that investors can expect some degree of pre-Budget positioning in the markets, though it is likely to be selective rather than a broad-based rally. However, Maurya said there could be bouts of buying in selected sectors, identified with the focus area of the Government, such as infrastructure, manufacturing, and consumption. He added that one cannot expect a broad-based move purely on expectation. ""The market shall have to await the Budget measures to ensure that concerns on growth are dealt with and fiscal discipline is seen,"" he concluded. Aggarwal meanwhile said that the sentiment typically improves on expectations of growth-supportive measures, especially around capital expenditure, infrastructure push, and incentives for emerging sectors as the Union Budget approaches. Cautious optimism: ""Recent market action suggests cautious optimism, with participants closely tracking macro signals, global cues, and fiscal discipline. While volatility may persist in the near term, incremental buying could emerge in pockets where policy continuity and earnings visibility are expected,"" the analyst said. That said, markets are unlikely to price in aggressive outcomes ahead of the Budget, and any upside may remain measured until there is clarity on actual announcements, Aggarwal said, adding that the near-term trend points towards consolidation with intermittent rallies, as investors balance Budget optimism with valuation concerns and global uncertainties. Which sectors will likely benefit? Ahead of the Union Budget 2026, the market focus is sharpening on sectors likely to benefit from a government push for economic growth, particularly through capital expenditure and rural revival, said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart. Infrastructire and defence: According to Meena, investors should look closely at infrastructure and defence, where expectations for sustained high allocation remain strong to support 'Make in India' initiatives. In the infrastructure space, companies like HG Infra Engineering and Larsen & Toubro (L&T) are top picks due to strong order books, while the defence sector offers opportunities in Bharat Electronics (BEL), Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), and Mazagon Dock as they benefit from localization policies. Renewables and critical minerals: Additionally, renewables and critical minerals are gaining traction, with stocks like National Aluminium Company (NALCO), Tata Power and GMDC in focus due to the global shift toward green energy and energy security. Consumption and agriculture: The consumption and agriculture sectors are critical themes this year, driven by expectations of fiscal stimulus to address rural distress, Meena said. “The market anticipates measures such as enhanced subsidies or tax relief to boost disposable income, which would directly benefit the rural economy. Consequently, agricultural inputs are a key area to watch, with stocks like UPL, Dhanuka Agritech, Fertilisers And Chemicals Travancore (FACT) and Coromandel International positioned to gain from farm support schemes,” according to the analyst. This rural recovery narrative extends to broader consumption plays - FMCG giants like Hindustan Unilever (HUL) and ITC are defensive bets, while Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) serves as a strong proxy for both auto and rural demand. Banks: Financials, particularly State Bank of India (SBI) and HDFC Bank, remain foundational holdings to play the overall credit growth story, according to Meena. ""While a sharp, broad-based rally ahead of the Budget appears unlikely, selective upside cannot be ruled out in budget-sensitive sectors. Any pre-Budget rally is likely to be narrow, stock-specific and driven by expectations around capex, defence spending and rural support rather than a sustained market-wide move,"" the analyst concluded. Investors may thus see pockets of rally, particularly in sectors linked to capital expenditure, infrastructure, manufacturing, defence, and rural consumption, as traders position themselves ahead of favourable policy cues, said Karthik Narayan, Vice President – Title, Tax & Transition, Stellar Innovations. However, a broad-based and sustained rally will depend upon how far the Budget can balance growth stimulus with fiscal discipline, the analyst said. What should investors do? Narender Agarwal, Founder & CEO at Wealth1, also noted that any rally ahead of the Budget is likely to be measured rather than euphoric, and investors should avoid aggressive positioning purely on expectations, focusing instead on fundamentally strong businesses. “For investors, the Budget should be seen as an opportunity to align portfolios with India’s long-term growth themes rather than focus solely on short-term volatility. A growth-oriented Budget, backed by strong economic momentum, can support broader market participation and set the stage for sustained returns beyond the Budget event,” said Tushar Badjate, Director of Badjate Stock & Shares.","Infrastructire and defence: According to Meena, investors should look closely at infrastructure and defence, where expectations for sustained high allocation remain strong to support 'Make in India' initiatives.","Ahead of the Union Budget 2026, the market focus is sharpening on sectors likely to benefit from a government push for economic growth, particularly through capital expenditure and rural revival, said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart.","Swapnil Aggarwal, Director at VSRK Capital, also said that investors can expect some degree of pre-Budget positioning in the markets, though it is likely to be selective rather than a broad-based rally.","That said, markets are unlikely to price in aggressive outcomes ahead of the Budget, and any upside may remain measured until there is clarity on actual announcements, Aggarwal said, adding that the near-term trend points towards consolidation with intermittent rallies, as investors balance Budget optimism with valuation concerns and global uncertainties.",positive,0.9075394868850708

Amid positive global cues, domestic indices opened on a strong note, extending the previous session’s sharp recovery. However, the benchmarks failed to sustain early gains and remained largely rangebound through the day, eventually closing with modest losses. At close, the Sensex was down 250.48 points or 0.30 percent at 83,627.69, and the Nifty was down 57.95 points or 0.22 percent at 25,732.30. Mixed performance was seen among the broader indices, with the BSE Midcap index declining 0.2 percent, while the Smallcap index rose 0.5 percent.

Click to View More Outlook for January 14 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets remained volatile on the weekly expiry day and ended marginally lower amid mixed cues. After an initial uptick, the Nifty 50 drifted lower for most of the session, though a rebound in the final hour trimmed some losses and helped it settle at 25,732.30. Sectoral trends were mixed, keeping participants engaged, with IT and metal stocks among the gainers, while realty and pharma remained subdued and closed in the red. The midcap and smallcap segments witnessed selective participation, with smallcaps showing modest resilience even as overall market breadth stayed moderate. Market action reflects the interplay between earnings-related reactions and global uncertainty. Early optimism was supported by encouraging IT earnings and signs of progress in India–U.S. trade discussions, which lifted sentiment in the first half. However, the lack of follow-through and fresh selling in heavyweights across sectors capped the upside. Ongoing geopolitical and global trade concerns also continued to weigh on risk appetite, keeping trading largely stock-specific. We maintain a cautious view on the Nifty and suggest continuing with a sell-on-rise approach until the index decisively reclaims the 26,000 level. A decisive breach of medium-term 100-day EMA, placed near 25,600, could accelerate the decline toward the 25,400 zone. Given the earnings season and fluctuating global cues, it is prudent to stay light and wait for clearer confirmation of the next directional move. Participants should focus on stock-specific opportunities and prefer a hedged approach amid the prevailing choppiness. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After witnessing an excellent upside recovery from the lows on Monday, Nifty slipped into weakness from the highs on Tuesday and closed the day's lower amidst recovery note. After opening on an upside gap, Nifty failed to sustain the highs and slipped into weakness in the early-mid part of the session. Smart recovery has emerged from near the lows of 25600 and Nifty finally closed off the lows. The opening upside gap has been filled completely. A long bear candle was formed on the daily chart with long lower shadow. Technically, this market action indicates presence of crucial overhead resistance around 25900-26000 levels. But the buying has started to emerge from near the lower supports. This is positive signal and hints at the possibility of eventual breakout in the short term. The underlying short-term trend of Nifty remains positive. The formation of higher bottom reversal pattern on intraday chart (60 min) indicates that the market could move up from here and surpass the hurdle of 25900-26000 levels in the next few sessions. Immediate support is placed at 25600 levels. Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The brokerage played down investor concerns around deposit growth and the elevated loan-to-deposit ratio. HDFC Bank stock was last seen at Rs 936.5 in afternoon trade, little changed on the day, after touching an intraday high of Rs 947.7 in the morning, when it was up about 1.1 percent. The stock remains up around 15 percent over the past year, outperforming the Nifty 50’s roughly 11 percent gain over the same period.

Will Trump's 25% tariff on countries doing business with Iran be a negative for Indian markets? Here's what analysts say,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/will-trump-s-25-tariff-on-countries-doing-business-with-iran-be-a-negative-for-indian-markets-here-s-what-analysts-say-13770512.html,"US President Donald Trump has announced that any country engaging in business with Iran will face 25 percent tariff on any trade with US. Analysts have suggested what this can mean for Indian stock markets. Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty have seen some pressure last year amid Trump’s tariff flipflops. The almost muted annual returns in 2025 came as Trump increased tariffs on Indian exports to US to 50 percent, citing New Delhi’s continued purchase of Russian oil. Amid Iran's biggest anti-government protests in years, Trump took to Truth Social to announce his new round of tariffs. ""Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America,"" he wrote. ""This Order is final and conclusive,"" Trump said without providing any further detail. No official documentation from the White House on the new round of tariffs has yet been released. Iran, a member of the OPEC oil producing group, has been heavily sanctioned by Washington for years. It exports much of its oil to China, with Turkey, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and India among its other top trading partners. Sensex dropped more than 545 points (0.65 percent) to 83,328, while Nifty 50 fell 157 points (0.61 percent) to 25,632.90, as seen at 1 pm on Tuesday. Fresh pressure on India? Trump’s decision to impose a 25 percent tariff on countries trading with Iran adds fresh pressure on India, which is already facing tariffs of up to 50 percent on several exports to the US. Together, this creates a potential tariff burden of as much as 75 percent on certain Indian goods. India–Iran trade stood at $1.68 billion in FY25, and mainly comprised exports of rice, food products, medicines, tea, and spices to Iran, while imports include chemicals and dry fruits, said Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza. He noted that while the trade size is modest, the concern is that the US tariff applies broadly to countries doing business with Iran, not just to Iran related goods. “A key strategic risk is the Chabahar Port project in Iran, which is vital for India’s access to Central Asia. While the project currently has a US sanctions waiver valid until April 2026, there is uncertainty over whether it will remain protected,” the analyst further said. 'A key macro overhang for Indian markets, but...' The renewed threat of a 25 percent tariff by former US President Donald Trump has resurfaced as a key macro overhang for Indian markets, but its actual economic impact needs to be viewed with perspective rather than panic, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS. He noted that while headlines suggest a broad-based disruption, India's direct export exposure to the US remains concentrated in select segments such as textiles, gems and jewellery, leather goods and certain engineering products. Impact on Rupee? A potential 25 percent tariff threat on exports to the US is already being felt as it adds to trade tensions, which affect rupee weakness, especially in sectors that are more sensitive to exports, said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara. “Although the Indian economy is more domestically oriented, stock markets related to exports can suffer short-term turbulence in stock markets due to the potential growth impact from tariffs. Investors will watch to what level of diversification can happen to avoid the negative impact due to tariffs,” he said. “For markets, the immediate reaction has been driven more by sentiment than fundamentals. Export-linked stocks may witness near-term volatility, but India’s broader market construct today is far more domestically anchored than in previous tariff cycles. Consumption, financials, infrastructure and services continue to be driven by internal demand rather than US trade flows,” Dasani said, adding that this phase will let investors distinguish headline risk from earnings reality. In the near term, the impact should be manageable due to low Iran trade exposure and ongoing India–US negotiations, and over the medium term, a negotiated settlement remains the most likely outcome, which would limit market damage and reduce long term risks, said Tiwari from Bonanza.

"Jefferies says new labour codes may add to margin pressures for IT companies, sees lower wage hikes at senior level",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jefferies-says-new-labour-codes-may-add-to-margin-pressures-for-it-companies-sees-lower-wage-hikes-at-senior-level-13770233.html,"Global brokerage firm Jefferies on Monday said India’s new labour codes are likely to add to margin pressures for information technology (IT) firms and could lead to lower wage hikes, particularly at the senior level. The labour codes, which came into effect in November, mandate that employee wages must be at least 50 percent of cost to company (CTC), with benefits such as provident fund and gratuity to be calculated on wages. This is expected to raise recurring employee costs for IT companies and also result in a large one-time financial impact. ""New labour codes will add to the margin pressures from slower revenue growth, AI-led business mix change and potentially higher onsite wage hikes in FY27 and FY28 due to changes in H-1B visa norms,"" Jefferies said in a note. It added that a 2 percent increase in Indian employee costs could reduce FY27 earnings estimates by 2-4 percent for IT companies. Firms are likely to offset part of the impact through lower wage hikes, especially at senior levels. IT services firm HCLTech reported an 11.2 percent decline in consolidated net profit to Rs 4,076 crore for the October-December quarter of FY26, mainly due to a one-time provision of Rs 719 crore linked to the implementation of the new labour codes. The Noida-based company had posted a net profit of Rs 4,591 crore in the same quarter last year. Excluding the one-time impact, HCLTech said net profit would have stood at Rs 4,795 crore. Regulatory filings showed that the impact on earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) was Rs 956 crore. HCLTech said the one-time impact under the labour code amounted to about Rs 900 crore, and that this would not affect its hiring plans. Chief People Officer Ram Sundararajan said the company has factored in all required provisions in the current quarter’s pay changes and does not expect any further significant incremental costs related to the new rules. Country’s largest IT services exporter Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) also reported a 13.91 percent decline in profit for the December quarter at Rs 10,657 crore, largely due to the one-time impact of the labour codes. The company said the implementation of the new labour codes during the quarter led to a statutory impact of Rs 2,128 crore. Excluding this, profit would have grown 8.5 percent to Rs 13,438 crore.

"Auto stocks decline for fifth straight session: Analysts say overall outlook is positive, cite multiple tailwinds",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/auto-stocks-decline-for-fifth-straight-session-analysts-say-overall-outlook-is-positive-cite-multiple-tailwinds-13770407.html,"The shares of automakers and auto-parts makers dropped in trade on January 13, extending losses for the fifth consecutive session. Analysts have however expressed optimism, and what investment strategy investors should take after the consolidation. The fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty Auto index down around 0.7 percent to 27,817, as seen at 12.15 pm on Tuesday. The index has fallen more than 3 percent in the past five days. Top auto losers today: Tube Investments of India shares were the top loser on the index, falling around 2 percent to trade at Rs 2,367 apiece. Exide Industries, Uno Minda, Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) and TVS Motor Company shares meanwhile fell more than 1 percent each. Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Hero MotoCorp shares fell nearly 1 percent each, while Ashok Leyland and Eicher Motors shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. Bucking the trend, Sona BLW Precision Forgings, Bosch, Bajaj Auto, Bharat Forge and Samvardhana Motherson International shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. Here's what analysts say: The recent fall in the auto stocks reflects near-term profit booking and demand concerns, rather than a structural breakdown of the sector, said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara. Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS, also said that the recent correction in Nifty Auto should be viewed more as a phase of consolidation than a breakdown in the sector’s fundamentals. ""Auto stocks have delivered strong returns over the last year, and some near-term profit booking was inevitable, especially amid broader market volatility. Importantly, the medium-term outlook for the auto sector remains constructive, supported by multiple policy and demand tailwinds,"" he said. From the March 2025 low of 19,300, the Nifty Auto index has rallied nearly 40 percent to 27,555, indicating that a lot of optimism is already priced in, said Tushar Badjate, Director of Badjate Stock & Shares. He noted that the recent correction reflects valuation rationalisation rather than demand stress. What lies ahead? Going forward, a rebound in demand indicators, stability in macros, and clarity in policies might help the auto names stabilize, Maurya said. However, he cautioned that till the time clear triggers on consumer demand or sector-specific catalysts emerge, volatility and range-bound action are likely to persist in the near term. Dasani noted that the potential GST rationalisation on automobiles, expectations of interest rate cuts, and income tax relief aimed at boosting disposable income can meaningfully support vehicle demand across segments. Lower financing costs tend to have a direct and visible impact on auto sales, particularly in passenger vehicles and two-wheelers. In addition, government focus on manufacturing, EV adoption, and infrastructure continues to support long-term volume growth, the analyst said. Will Trump's 500% tariff threat impact auto stocks? Concerns around the proposed 500 percent US tariff should not materially alter the outlook for Indian auto manufacturers, as India’s direct auto exports to the US are limited, Dasani highlighted. The impact, if any, is more likely to be felt by select auto ancillary players supplying components to global OEMs, rather than domestic auto makers themselves. Is this correction a buying opportunity? ""Overall, the recent correction offers an opportunity to recalibrate positions in a sector where structural drivers remain firmly intact and visibility on demand recovery continues to improve,"" Dasani concluded. Badjate said that going ahead, growth is likely to be more selective—led by OEMs with strong product pipelines, export visibility and rising EV penetration, which is gradually emerging as a structural growth driver for the sector. ""While near-term volatility may persist amid the ongoing Q3 earnings season, the broader structural outlook for the sector remains intact. The current correction could offer a buying opportunity for long-term investors, supported by healthy fundamentals and the Government’s continued focus on incentives for electric vehicles and hybrid mobility. Investors should maintain a selective approach, with a preference for sector leaders that have strong EV exposure,"" said Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, AVP -Research & Advisory at Master Capital Services. Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking, said that with the earnings season underway, volatility is likely to persist, driven by stock-specific results. ""While most stocks in the sector are participating in the move, Bajaj Auto, Eicher Motors, TVS Motor, M&M, and Maruti are displaying relative strength and can be considered for accumulation on declines,"" he said.

The recovery in the IT majors' shares also followed a reversal in broader markets, with BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty erasing morning losses to edge into the green. TCS stock was trading at Rs 3,258.1 around noon, up 0.6 percent, reversing losses seen in early trade amid concerns around limited growth visibility. The recovery followed a firm 1.1 percent rise in the previous session ahead of the earnings announcement -- this suggests that some investors may have used early weakness to selectively add positions.

The stock had fallen more than 2 percent in the morning trade after its Q3 results, despite a strong operational performance and a guidance upgrade, as brokerages flagged constraints on near-term upside. The intraday rebound in both stocks points to stabilising sentiment after initial post-results selling. In both cases, analysts broadly acknowledged steady execution, healthy deal pipelines, and resilient margins. However, enthusiasm remained tempered by broader concerns around growth sustainability and near-term earnings momentum. Also read | HCL Tech Q3 results review: Fundamentals improve, but brokerages cautious on near-term stock outlook For TCS, brokerages highlighted muted international business trends, modest forward indicators, and limited clarity on a sharp growth acceleration, keeping most houses in neutral or cautious territory despite operational stability. For HCL Tech, analysts pointed to seasonality risks -- especially in the products business -- along with valuation comfort and historical post-results performance patterns as factors restraining near-term optimism. Despite the midday recovery, both stocks remain under pressure on a longer-term basis. TCS is still down over 24 percent over the past year, while HCL Tech has fallen more than 16 percent over the same period. The investor focus remains firmly on whether deal execution, demand momentum, and AI-led initiatives can translate into a more durable growth recovery.

"Capital One, Amex shares sink on Trump's credit-card threat",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/capital-one-amex-shares-sink-on-trump-s-credit-card-threat-13770303.html,"Shares of Capital One Financial Corp., American Express Co. and other US banks sank after President Donald Trump called on credit-card companies to cap interest rates at 10% for a year, a move that could wipe out billions in profits for one of the banking industry’s biggest businesses. Capital One, the largest US card issuer, tumbled 6.4% in New York, the biggest decline in nine months, after the president surprised the industry with a move he said could go into effect next week. American Express dropped 4.3% and JPMorgan Chase & Co., No. 2 in the card rankings, slid 1.4%. Card interest rates, which have been hovering above 20% in recent years, have been a target of US lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, with bills popping up proposing similar caps and meeting stiff resistance from the industry. Trump, speaking Sunday to reporters, set a Jan. 20 deadline for companies to comply or risk being “in violation of the law.” The cap proposed by the president “could wipe out earnings from cards for a year,” Mike Mayo, an analyst at Wells Fargo & Co., said in a note. The idea “would ruin card economics (eliminate most of card earnings today) and incentives would be to stop lending,” Mayo said. Citigroup Inc. dropped 3%, while Wells Fargo slipped 1% and Synchrony Financial lost 8.4% on Monday. Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. also fell. While those companies aren’t issuers of credit cards, they rely on fees generated when consumers use their products. Despite the political appeal of Trump’s proposal, several analysts questioned whether approval of a rate cap was likely, given the strength of the banking industry’s pull in Congress and limited legislative momentum. “Given how severe it is, it is hard to imagine it moving forward,” Brian Foran, an analyst at Truist Financial Corp., wrote in a note. In response to Trump’s call, industry groups including the Bank Policy Institute and Consumer Bankers Association struck a measured tone. “We share the president’s goal of helping Americans access more affordable credit,” the groups said in a joint statement late Friday. “At the same time, evidence shows that a 10% interest rate cap would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small-business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help.” Should the idea take effect, fallout would probably affect lower-income consumers the most as banks restrict their access to loans, according to several analysts. “As credit availability is curtailed, consumers will have to rely on alternate sources of consumer lending,” KBW Inc. analyst Sanjay Sakhrani wrote in a note, adding that those alternatives are “significantly more expensive” for borrowers. Barclays Plc, the British lender that relies on credit cards as a key part of its US consumer banking business, slumped 2.4% in London, the firm’s biggest loss since Nov. 18. What Bloomberg Intelligence Says: Any US cap or restriction on credit card rates would hit Barclays hardest among European banks. The lender’s US consumer bank is expected to generate £3.6 billion revenue in 2025 (12% of group total), but 5% of pretax profit, with credit cards a key element. Though President Donald Trump’s demand that credit card interest rates are capped at 10% might not be enforced in full given the strength of US bank lobby groups. — Phil Richards, BI banking analyst There could be a few winners as well. Wells Fargo’s Mayo said that if general availability of traditional credit card loans is reduced due to rate caps, the attractiveness of buy-now, pay-later firms such as Klarna Group Plc and Affirm Holdings Inc. could increase. Shares of Klarna fell 2.7% and Affirm lost 6.6%. Airlines, which generate substantial profits from credit-card partnerships, also took a hit on Monday. Delta Air Lines Inc. shares fell 1.8%, United Airlines Holdings Inc. dropped 1.7% and Southwest Airlines Co. slipped 1.5%. Retailers with substantive credit-card portfolios also took a hit. Macy’s Inc. fell 5.4% on Monday and Kohl’s Corp. shares were down 3.9%.

Services business performance was also strong (+1.8% QoQ CC) defying the furloughs and holidays impact. The service business growth was majorly led by ER&D segment that reported another quarter of strong growth (+3.1% QoQ CC vs 2.2% QoQ CC LQ). The service-led growth was largely aided by extop 20 accounts (+2.3% QoQ), which implies the decision making and execution cycle remains strong at the lower-end of the pyramid. Again, the advanced AI revenue growth (19.9% QoQ CC) is largely a component of short-burst deals that further validates the velocity of smaller deal remains strong. The new deal TCV reported at USD3.0b, which includes one of the mega deals (USD473m) of five-year strategic engagement. We believe the service-led growth should continue its momentum in FY27/FY28 on the back of strong order wins and growing AI revenue stream. Hence, we are revising the topline CC growth upward by 30bps/20bps to 7.0% and 7.7% for FY27E/FY28E. Despite the beat on margins in Q3, we expect Q4 will see some normalization, while additional new labour code would also keep the margin in check.

HCL Tech stock was trading 2.37 percent lower at Rs 1,628 around 10 am, hovering near the day’s low, underperforming a firmer broader market. The stock has now given up its pre-results gains and remains over 16 percent lower over the past year. That was also a key factor tempering sentiment even after a strong operational quarter. Broader market sentiment was positive, with benchmark indices NSE Nifty and BSE Sensex seeing moderate gains. Brokerages broadly acknowledged HCL Tech’s strong Q3 delivery, marked by robust deal wins, stable margins, and a guidance upgrade that places the company at the top end of the peer growth range. However, most analysts stopped short of turning bullish on the stock, flagging seasonality risks, valuation comfort, and historical return patterns as constraints on near-term performance. Citi maintained a Neutral rating with a target price of Rs 1,700, noting that while HCL Tech’s forward indicators and deal pipeline are stronger than peers, the current valuation leaves little room for sharp upside. HSBC and CLSA reiterated Hold calls, with CLSA highlighting that Q4 growth could turn sequentially negative due to seasonal weakness in the products business, a phase during which the stock has historically underperformed.

TCS shares slip in early trade as cautious brokerage views weigh after Q3 results,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/tcs-shares-slip-in-early-trade-as-cautious-brokerage-views-weigh-after-q3-results-13769817.html,"Shares of Tata Consultancy Services edged lower in early trade on Tuesday, as investors weighed the company’s Q3 FY26 results against a largely cautious brokerage outlook that flagged limited visibility on a sustained growth recovery. TCS stock slipped to Rs 3,220.4 in the opening minutes, down 0.6 percent, reversing part of the 1.1 percent rise in the previous session ahead of the earnings announcement. Broader market sentiment was marginally positive, with benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty trading slightly higher in early deals. The early weakness reflects subdued investor sentiment following the results, despite analysts broadly agreeing that TCS delivered an in-line operational quarter excluding exceptional items and maintained stable margins. However, the absence of a clear acceleration in demand has kept expectations in check, particularly for the company’s international business, which remains a key driver of overall growth. Most brokerages stopped short of turning positive on the stock, citing muted international growth trends, modest deal momentum, and limited evidence of growth leadership returning in the near term. Forward indicators such as deal conversion and headcount trends were also seen as offering little immediate comfort. Several brokerages retained ‘neutral’ or ‘hold’ ratings, signalling a cautious stance on near-term prospects. Citi remained bearish on the stock, while CLSA stood out as the only brokerage with a clearly constructive view, pointing to stable margins, a sharp rise in AI-led revenue, and management’s confidence in stronger growth in CY26. TCS had reported a 14 percent year-on-year decline in reported Q3 net profit, largely due to hefty exceptional charges linked to restructuring, statutory impacts, and a legal provision. Excluding these one-offs, profit rose 8.5 percent, highlighting operational stability. The company also announced a Rs 57 per share dividend, including a special payout. With the stock now down over 24 percent over the past year, investors remain focused on whether demand momentum and deal activity can improve meaningfully in the coming quarters to support a sustained re-rating.

Shares of HCL Tech closed marginally higher at Rs 1,667 on Monday, up 0.34 percent, ahead of the results. The stock remains down over 16 percent over the past year, underperforming the broader market. That is also a key reason brokerages are tempering enthusiasm even after a strong quarter. Brokerage commentary broadly agreed that the business is executing well, but valuations and seasonal risks cap upside, advising against aggressive buying at current levels. What worked: Deal wins, guidance upgrade, margins HCL Tech delivered a strong operational quarter, marked by a 43 percent year-on-year jump in trailing twelve-month deal TCV, improved margins, and a guidance upgrade. Services revenue growth guidance for FY26 was raised to 4.75-5.25 percent in constant currency, placing HCL Tech at the upper end of the peer group. Citi issued a Neutral rating with a target price of Rs 1,700, noting that HCL Tech’s forward indicators are better than peers, aided by rising headcount and management focus on identifying new spend areas. Citi also raised FY27-FY28 earnings estimates by 2 percent. HSBC gave a Hold call with a target of Rs 1,815, highlighting that HCL Tech has sustained Q2 momentum into Q3 and now sits at the top end of the peer growth range. HSBC sees operating margins trending towards 18-19 percent in FY27, with a 5-6 percent medium-term revenue CAGR appearing achievable. Why caution persists despite a strong quarter Despite the upbeat fundamentals, brokerages remain wary of near-term performance of HCL Tech shares, citing seasonality, valuation comfort, and historical return patterns. CLSA kept a Hold rating with a target of Rs 1,661, pointing out that even at the upper end of guidance, Q4 implies negative sequential growth in constant currency, largely due to seasonal weakness in the products business. CLSA also flagged that historically, HCL Tech stock has delivered weak returns between Q4 and Q2, compared with strong gains in the Q2-Q3 period. The bullish pocket: AI-led services strategy The one clear positive differentiator is HCL Tech’s AI-focused, services-led growth strategy, which is gaining traction. Nomura stood out with a Buy rating and a target price of Rs 1,810, implying an upside of nearly 9 percent. It cited a clear earnings beat, guidance lift, and margin resilience. Nomura views the company’s asset-light, services-centric AI push as structurally positive, while expecting margins to normalise favourably in FY27.

Most brokerages stopped short of a bullish stance and flagged limited growth visibility, muted international momentum, and constrained margin upside despite an in-line operational quarter. TCS shares had risen a firm 1.1 percent on Monday to close at Rs 3,243 on the NSE ahead of the earnings announcement. Even so, the stock remains down more than 24 percent over the past year, with investors watching whether growth momentum can revive in CY26. Citi struck a bearish note with a ‘Sell’ call on TCS stock and a target price of Rs 3,020 per share. While it acknowledged that Q3 performance was in line excluding exceptional items, Citi flagged weak forward indicators -- that includes just a 1.5 percent year-on-year growth in trailing twelve-month total contract value, and a 4 percent YoY decline in headcount. The brokerage warned that muted international business growth could disappoint. It noted that nearly half of the quarter-on-quarter revenue growth was driven by equipment and software, rather than core services. Nomura maintained a ‘Neutral’ rating with a target price of Rs 3,300, describing the quarter as a modest beat on revenue and margins. However, it said visibility on TCS’ growth leadership remains limited. While management expects CY26 to outperform CY25, Nomura cautioned that meaningful margin expansion in FY27 appears unlikely without a stronger and broader-based growth recovery. HSBC also remained cautious, retaining a ‘Hold’ rating and a target price of Rs 3,450. The brokerage said Q3 reflected a largely status quo quarter, with no material change in growth trends. While margins were solid and demand commentary was positive, HSBC said the stock’s risk-reward appears balanced at current levels. CLSA offered a clearly positive stance, with an ‘Outperform’ call and a target price of Rs 3,593, implying an upside of about 11 percent on TCS share price. CLSA highlighted TCS’ 0.8 percent constant-currency sequential revenue growth in Q3 FY26 and management’s confidence in stronger CY26 growth. It also pointed to the sharp rise in annualised AI revenue to $1.8 billion, up 17.3 percent quarter-on-quarter, as a key positive. However, it noted that the order book declined 7 percent sequentially to $9.3 billion. EBIT margin stood at 25.2 percent, up 70 basis points year-on-year despite wage hikes. TCS had reported a 14 percent year-on-year fall in reported Q3 net profit due to large exceptional charges, even as profit excluding one-offs rose 8.5 percent. The company also announced a Rs 57 per share dividend, including a special payout.

"MidCap, SmallCap inflows in 2025 hit record high despite scheme delivers muted returns",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mutual-funds/midcap-smallcap-inflows-in-2025-hit-record-high-despite-scheme-delivers-muted-returns-13769363.html,"Inflows into mid-cap and small-cap mutual fund schemes touched record levels in 2025 despite sharp volatility in broader markets, the absence of foreign investors from these segments, stretched valuations, and muted earnings. AMFI data showed that mid-cap schemes received Rs 49,939 crore during the year, up 46 percent from a year earlier, while small-cap schemes attracted Rs 52,321 crore, an increase of 53 percent. Market performance remained mixed during the period. The BSE MidCap index rose 1.1 percent in 2025, while the BSE SmallCap index declined 6.6 percent. In comparison, the Sensex and Nifty gained nearly 9 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively. Axis Securities’ Rajesh Palviya said the inflows were supported by steady SIP investments and investors continuing to add to their mutual fund holdings, based on the strong three-year and five-year outperformance of mid-cap and small-cap stocks over large-cap shares. Market breadth stayed weak. Of the 140 stocks in the BSE MidCap index, 86 ended the year with negative returns, while in the BSE SmallCap index, 871 of the 1,186 stocks were in the red. In the BSE100 index, 61 stocks posted gains and 39 recorded losses. Palviya said investors have been using market declines to average their investments, as SIP inflows into mid-cap and small-cap schemes continue on a regular basis. Domestic investors have been the main source of net inflows over the past two years and have preferred mid-cap and small-cap schemes over large-cap funds. Foreign investors have largely stayed away from these segments and have mainly been selling large-cap stocks, which has further concentrated domestic flows into mid-cap and small-cap schemes. The share of mid-cap and small-cap schemes in total equity inflows also increased during the year. Mid-cap funds accounted for a record 14.26 percent of total equity inflows, up from 8.7 percent in 2024 and 14.18 percent in 2023. Small-cap funds also saw their share rise to a two-year high of 14.26 percent, compared with 8.68 percent in 2024 and 25.4 percent in 2023. Total equity inflows for the year stood at Rs 3.51 lakh crore, down 11.19 percent from Rs 3.94 lakh crore in 2024 and Rs 1.62 lakh crore in 2023. Analysts said the absence of outflows despite nearly 16 months of muted returns indicates continued investor commitment. They said many investors remain focused on a three- to four-year horizon, even as near-term returns have been weak, while investment in assets such as gold and silver at current elevated prices is harder to justify for long-term allocations. Independent research analyst Ambreesh Baliga said inflows into mutual funds are likely to continue going ahead as mid-cap and small-cap funds have delivered better results than individual portfolios. While many individual portfolios are down 20 percent to 30 percent or more, he said even the worst-performing mid-cap and small-cap funds were down only about 5 percent to 6 percent as of the end of December. Baliga said investor interest remains as long as losses are limited. He added that when losses become large, investors stop averaging, liquidity in the secondary market declines, selling pressure rises, and stocks can fall further, sometimes leading to margin calls.","While many individual portfolios are down 20 percent to 30 percent or more, he said even the worst-performing mid-cap and small-cap funds were down only about 5 percent to 6 percent as of the end of December.","Of the 140 stocks in the BSE MidCap index, 86 ended the year with negative returns, while in the BSE SmallCap index, 871 of the 1,186 stocks were in the red.","He added that when losses become large, investors stop averaging, liquidity in the secondary market declines, selling pressure rises, and stocks can fall further, sometimes leading to margin calls.","Of the 140 stocks in the BSE MidCap index, 86 ended the year with negative returns, while in the BSE SmallCap index, 871 of the 1,186 stocks were in the red.",negative,0.9681528806686401
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade JSW Energy, SJVN, Alkem Labs, BSE, State Bank of India, and others on January 13?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-jsw-energy-sjvn-alkem-labs-bse-state-bank-of-india-and-others-on-january-13-13769531.html,"Equity benchmarks bounced back with 0.4 percent gains on January 12, but market breadth remained weak, with 1,866 shares declining against 1,044 advancing shares on the NSE. The market may extend its upward journey, but sustainability remains the key factor to watch. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi SJVN | CMP: Rs 80.53 SJVN registered a decisive breakout on January 2 above the Rs 76.5 level, supported by a strong surge in volumes, confirming the strength of the move. Over the last 2–3 sessions, the stock witnessed a healthy pullback towards the breakout zone, accompanied by declining volumes, indicating a classic low-volume retest. Currently, price action has reversed from this support area, suggesting renewed buying interest. On the hourly chart, the DMI has generated a bullish crossover, while the ADX is placed well above the threshold of 20, currently around 32.5, highlighting strong trend momentum. This combination of price, volume, and momentum signals strengthens the bullish outlook. Hence, SJVN is expected to witness a fresh bullish move in the coming few sessions, with the breakout zone now acting as a strong support base. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 81–79 zone, with a target of Rs 86. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 86 Stop-Loss: Rs 76 JSW Energy | CMP: Rs 498.8 JSW Energy has recently confirmed a bullish breakout from an inverse Head and Shoulder pattern, supported by a strong surge in volumes, which validates the reliability of the formation. This breakout indicates a clear shift from a corrective phase to a potential trend reversal on the upside. The stock is currently reversing after witnessing a mild pullback, but the decline is accompanied by relatively low volumes, suggesting that selling pressure is weak and the move is more of a healthy retest rather than a breakdown. Importantly, the weekly pivot support is closely aligned with the neckline of the pattern, strengthening the support zone. This confluence enhances the probability of a fresh upward move from current levels. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 500–490 zone, with a target of Rs 550. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 550 Stop-Loss: Rs 475 Rail Vikas Nigam | CMP: Rs 331.65 RVNL has witnessed a sharp correction after a strong up-move and is now approaching a crucial support zone in the Rs 330–320 range. This zone coincides with prior consolidation and visible demand on the chart, indicating that accumulation interest is likely to emerge at lower levels. On the daily timeframe, the stock has slipped back into the Ichimoku cloud after facing rejection near the upper band. This suggests a transition from a strong bullish phase to a corrective or consolidation phase. However, as long as Rs 303 is protected on a closing basis, the broader price structure remains intact and supportive of a potential trend resumption. Momentum indicators also reflect a healthy reset. The RSI has cooled off from overbought levels and is currently hovering near 45, indicating normalization rather than weakness. Overall, the setup favours a pullback-led rebound once stability is established near the support zone. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 333–327 zone, with a target of Rs 364. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 364 Stop-Loss: Rs 303 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Alkem Laboratories | CMP: Rs 5,867 Alkem Labs has witnessed some long additions amid its recent uptrend, and the stock has also provided a breakout from the falling trendline. During the recent market correction, the stock did not correct and instead consolidated within a range of Rs 5,600–5,800, and now appears ready for an upside breakout. The stock has the highest Call open interest at Rs 6,000 and faces no major resistance ahead. Hence, the short-term target is Rs 6,000, and beyond that Rs 6,100, while immediate support is seen at Rs 5,750 levels. Buy Alkem Labs Futures in the range of Rs 5,850–5,970. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,000, Rs 6,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,750 Hindustan Zinc | CMP: Rs 628.25 Hindustan Zinc has corrected in the short term; however, this was mainly on account of profit booking. Hence, dips should be utilised as a buying opportunity. The stock appears to have consolidated within a short-term range of Rs 650–590 and now has significant support in the Rs 590–600 zone, while on the upside, Rs 660 is the minimum target. Although there is huge Call open interest at higher levels, there was significant Call unwinding in the last trading session, indicating that as long as the stock is trading well above its maximum pain level of Rs 620, the short-term trend remains positive. Buy Hindustan Zinc Futures in the range of Rs 625–630. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 650, Rs 660 Stop-Loss: Rs 615 Info Edge India | CMP: Rs 1,312.9 Info Edge had been consolidating within a range of Rs 1,400–1,300 for quite some time, and the breakdown below this range, along with an increase in open interest, indicates short build-up. Earlier, the stock had fallen due to long unwinding; however, it now appears that short positions are being added, which is a negative sign for the stock going ahead. There have been significant Call additions in the Rs 1,320–1,400 strikes, which is a negative indicator. However, the Rs 1,260–1,280 strikes have seen good Put additions as well, so a break below those levels could lead to a major sell-off. Until then, the stock may consolidate for some time, but eventually it looks relatively weak. The stock is now trading below its maximum pain as well as VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price), both of which will act as crucial resistances in the near term. Sell Info Edge Futures in the range of Rs 1,320–1,300. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 1,250, Rs 1,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,365 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital Ramco Cements | CMP: Rs 1,083.5 Ramco Cements is showing a positive multi-timeframe setup. On the monthly chart, the stock has posted three consecutive bullish mean reversions from the 12-month EMA and is holding above the previous month’s high, indicating strengthening momentum. On the weekly scale, it is building a base near the 50% Fibonacci retracement and the 50-week EMA, supported by a pickup in volumes above the 20-week average. A bullish MACD crossover further reinforces the constructive outlook and signals potential continuation of the uptrend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,170 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,040 BSE | CMP: Rs 2,790.6 BSE continues to exhibit strong relative strength on the weekly chart, trading in a tight range around the 12-week EMA despite heightened market volatility. On the daily timeframe, volumes have expanded above the 20-day average while the stock sustains above the 26-DEMA, indicating active participation and trend support. The weekly RSI near 60 further confirms sustained bullish momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,096 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,678 State Bank of India | CMP: Rs 1,015.15 SBI has been exhibiting a strong and orderly uptrend since February 2025, marked by a gradual rise and a robust price structure. The stock remains well placed above its key 12- and 26-week EMAs, indicating healthy trend strength. On the daily chart, SBI has shown a bullish mean reversion from the 12-DEMA, while the RSI continues to hold above 60 across timeframes, confirming sustained bullish momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,086 Stop-Loss: Rs 975 SBI Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 2,098 SBI Life Insurance continues to trade within a well-defined long-term rising channel since 2021, reflecting a strong structural uptrend. The stock remains comfortably placed above its 12- and 26-week EMAs, while the daily chart highlights notable resilience amid broader market volatility. Momentum remains firmly supportive, with the RSI holding above 60 on both the weekly and daily timeframes, confirming a well-established uptrend backed by strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,308 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,014","The stock appears to have consolidated within a short-term range of Rs 650–590 and now has significant support in the Rs 590–600 zone, while on the upside, Rs 660 is the minimum target.","Although there is huge Call open interest at higher levels, there was significant Call unwinding in the last trading session, indicating that as long as the stock is trading well above its maximum pain level of Rs 620, the short-term trend remains positive.","This zone coincides with prior consolidation and visible demand on the chart, indicating that accumulation interest is likely to emerge at lower levels.","The stock appears to have consolidated within a short-term range of Rs 650–590 and now has significant support in the Rs 590–600 zone, while on the upside, Rs 660 is the minimum target.",positive,0.9212843179702759

The Metropolitan Stock Exchange (MSE) is set to begin its operations and trading is expected to begin on the new exchange within the next two weeks, CNBC-Awaaz reported citing sources. As liquidity remains a concern around a new stock exchange, MSE has planned a comprehensive liquidity enhancement scheme under which it will appoint market makers to provide liquidity support for approximately 130 stocks, the channel added. MSE has raised Rs 1,240 crore in two tranches in December 2024 and August 2025, which saw participation from major brokerage houses Groww and Zerodha. However, analysts said that breaking the NSE-BSE duopoly may not be easy as they hold strong market shares, the channel added. According to data cited by the report, NSE holds approximately 90-92 percent share, while BSE holds 8-10 percent share in the cash segment. In stock futures and options (F&O), NSE holds around 95 percent share, while BSE holds around 5 percent share. In index F&O, NSE holds nearly 80 percent share, and BSE holds approximately 20 percent share. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. Notably, market regulator SEBI in 2025 introduced new rules to allow only two weekly equity derivatives expiries in any segment during the week. Currently, NSE has Nifty 50 expiry on Tuesdays, while BSE has Sensex expiry on Thursdays. A new stock exchange on the market may face competition and the risk of low liquidity as a result of this. Earlier, MSE had introduced a Liquidity Enhancement Scheme (LES) in its Equity and Equity Derivatives segments. Then known as MCX Stock Exchange, it had introduced the scheme in 2013 in order to encourage participation in these segments. ""The MCX-SX Liquidity Enhancement Scheme will appoint 3 market makers for futures contract in 50 liquid scrips. These market makers are incentivized to ensure that quotes and depth is available. For other stock futures, options and equity cash, all participants are incentivized to maintain passive orders which will help in building depth,"" it had said.","Earlier, MSE had introduced a Liquidity Enhancement Scheme (LES) in its Equity and Equity Derivatives segments.","As liquidity remains a concern around a new stock exchange, MSE has planned a comprehensive liquidity enhancement scheme under which it will appoint market makers to provide liquidity support for approximately 130 stocks, the channel added.","For other stock futures, options and equity cash, all participants are incentivized to maintain passive orders which will help in building depth,"" it had said.","The Metropolitan Stock Exchange (MSE) is set to begin its operations and trading is expected to begin on the new exchange within the next two weeks, CNBC-Awaaz reported citing sources.",neutral,0.9380932450294495

Click to View More Outlook for January 13 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing sharp weakness in the last few sessions, Nifty witnessed an excellent bounce back from the lows on Monday and closed the day with decent gains of around 106 points. After opening on a weak note, Nifty slipped into weakness in the early part of the session. A sharp recovery has emerged from the lows of 25473 levels and the market sustained the gains till the end. A long bull candle has been formed on the daily chart with long lower shadow. Technically, this market action is indicating significant turnaround in the market for the short term. This is positive indication one may expect further upside in the short term. The underlying trend of Nifty seems to have turned up post sharp weakness of last week. Having recovered from the key lower levels decisively, Nifty could advance towards the next hurdle of 26000-26100 levels in the next few sessions. Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities Today, the benchmark indices witnessed a sharp recovery from the lower levels. The Nifty ended 107 points higher, while the Sensex was up by 302 points. Among sectors, the Metal Index outperformed today, rallying over 2 percent, whereas the Realty and Media indices shed over 1 percent. Technically, after an early morning intraday sharp selloff, the market took support near 25,500/82,700 and bounced back sharply. From the day's lowest point, the market bounced back over 300/1,200 points, which is largely positive. We are of the view that the intraday market texture is positive, but buy on dips and sell on rallies would be the ideal strategy for day traders. On the downside, 25,650/83,500 and 25,600/83,300 would act as key support zones, while 25,900-25,950/84,300-84,500 could serve as immediate resistance areas for the bulls. However, below 25,600/83,300, sentiment could change. If that happens, traders may consider exiting their long positions.

Analysts had noted that markets may see some rally in case of any positive news around this front. Sergio also referred to strategic initiatives like Pax Silica, calling it a US-led framework with India as a key partner. “Both sides continue to actively engage.

He added that below this mark, the correction wave is likely to continue until 58,800–58,500. Conversely, above 59,500, it could bounce back up to 59,800–59,000, the analyst added. Choice Broking meanwhile saw immediate support near 59,000, and said that a breakdown could open the door toward 58,900–58,800. On the upside, 59,500–59,600 remains a strong resistance band, and only a decisive move above this zone would revive bullish sentiment, it added.

The relief measures are a significant positive for Vi, with the NPV of AGR dues cut by ~73% to ~INR240b, on our estimates, with potential for further relief on the base AGR dues. This should enable Vi’s long-pending debt raise and increase capex over the medium term. However, Vi still owes ~INR1.23t to GoI toward deferred spectrum liabilities, with large ~INR62b/INR166b/INR270b annual repayments over FY27/FY28/FY29-32, and obtaining a similar relief (interest waiver, further deadline extensions) on the same would not be straightforward. Further, despite a potential increase in capex, regaining/retaining market share would remain a tall ask, given Vi’s competitors’ superior offerings and FCF generation. Outlook We reiterate Neutral on Vi with an unchanged TP of INR11/share, premised on 14x FY28 reported EV/EBITDA (implies ~22x FY28 pre-INDAS EV/EBITDA), a significant premium to larger peers.

He further added that both the countries continue to engage actively, and the next call on the much-awaited trade deal will take place tomorrow. ""President TRUMP will be visiting India in next 1-2 years hopefully,"" he added. While assuming charge in New Delhi on Monday, Gor said that Trump had conveyed his best wishes to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, referring to the relationship between the two leaders as genuine. ""Real friends can disagree, but resolve the difference,"" Gor said, framing current trade negotiations as part of a broader, resilient partnership. Notably, India-US trade deal has seen significant delays, putting pressure on markets for most of 2025 on the back of rising Trump tariffs. Analysts had noted that markets may see some rally in case of any positive news around this front. Sergio also referred to strategic initiatives like Pax Silica, calling it a US-led framework with India as a key partner. “Both sides continue to actively engage. Not an easy to cross the finish line, but determined,” he said, underscoring the challenges and commitment in ongoing talks. Senator Marco Rubio added, “This year will be a year of reciprocity,” highlighting the mutual intent to enhance cooperation across trade and strategic sectors.

The 5,000 m3 /hour green hydrogen plant was commissioned in Nov’25 for captive consumption of JSW Group’s steel plant, which is located at an adjacent site. Green hydrogen’s economics remain challenging vs. conventional fuels, and current costs continue to hover around USD3.5-4/Kg vs. the USD 2-2.5/Kg level required to achieve mass-scale commercialization. The floating solar plant with a capacity of 20 MW was commissioned in Sep’25 and is a novel concept, which eliminates land acquisition requirement, provides natural cooling (thus boosting generation by slowing down module degradation), though IRRs are broadly similar to ground-mounted solar plants. JSWE has nearly doubled its operational installed capacity from 7.2GW in FY24 end to 13.2GW as of 2QFY26, underscoring strong execution capabilities. The reduction in merchant exposure to ~5% of the installed base significantly enhances its cash flow stability.

DMart stock climbed 2.4 percent to Rs 3,892.6, after touching an intra-day high of Rs 3,918.6 (up 3.1 percent). At current levels, Avenue Supermarts commands a market capitalisation of about Rs 2.53 lakh crore and is up around 11 percent over the past year. The buying interest follows a margin-led earnings beat in the October-December quarter. Avenue Supermarts, which operates the DMart retail chain, reported a 17 percent year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 856 crore, while revenue grew 13.3 percent to Rs 18,101 crore. EBITDA rose over 20 percent, with margins expanding to 8.1 percent, aided by lower discounting after GST changes and favourable category mix. The rally in DMart stock has played out ahead of brokerage comfort. Post-quarterly results notes from Citi, Jefferies and Nuvama flagged muted same-store (LFL) growth of 5.6 percent and raised concerns around the sustainability of margin gains, particularly amid intensifying competition from quick-commerce platforms. Citi has a ‘Sell’ call on the stock, while Jefferies and Nuvama are at ‘Hold’. In contrast, Motilal Oswal has reiterated a ‘Buy’ rating with a target price of Rs 4,600, implying about 21 percent upside from current levels. The brokerage cited the profitability beat and gross-margin recovery, while also flagging pricing competition from quick commerce as a key near-term risk. Brokerages have also pointed to subdued like-for-like growth trends and the upcoming CEO transition as factors that could keep sentiment guarded despite the recent stock move.

Lemon Tree Hotels shares jump today on Warburg-led restructuring; brokerages see value unlocking,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/lemon-tree-hotels-shares-jump-today-on-warburg-led-restructuring-brokerages-see-value-unlocking-13767843.html,"Shares of Lemon Tree Hotels Ltd rose nearly 2 percent on Monday, extending recent gains. Investors reacted positively to the company’s sweeping restructuring plan, the entry of private equity major Warburg Pincus, and bullish brokerage commentary pointing to value unlocking and balance-sheet deleveraging. Lemon Tree Hotels stock was trading at Rs 152.8 at about 9:50 am, up 2 percent, after hitting an intraday high of Rs 155.99. Lemon Tree shares are up 11.6 percent over the past one year, valuing the company at under Rs 12,100 crore. The proposed scheme of arrangement will split the group into two focused platforms -- an asset-light hotel management and brand entity under Lemon Tree Hotels; and an asset-heavy ownership and development platform under Fleur Hotels. As part of the transaction, Warburg Pincus will acquire APG’s entire 41.09 percent stake in Fleur Hotels and has committed to invest Rs 960 crore in Fleur in tranches to support future expansion. Post-restructuring, Lemon Tree Hotels shareholders will directly own 32.96 percent of Fleur Hotels, with Lemon Tree itself holding 41.03 percent and Warburg Pincus owning the remaining 26.01 percent. Fleur Hotels will own 41 hotels with 5,813 keys, while Lemon Tree Hotels will manage 89 hotels with 6,011 keys under an asset-light model. Brokerages remain constructive on the stock, citing sharper business focus, improved capital structure and clearer valuation discovery. Nuvama has issued a ‘Buy’ rating on Lemon Tree Hotels with a target price of Rs 178 per share. The brokerage said the composite reorganisation and Warburg’s entry as a strategic investor in Fleur Hotels meaningfully strengthens the group’s long-term profile. Nuvama added that Warburg’s buyout of APG’s stake effectively reintroduces the global private equity firm to the capital table and de-risks future large-scale capital expenditure at Fleur. Investec, which has a ‘Buy’ rating and a higher target price of Rs 187, said the long-awaited Fleur demerger should unlock value in Lemon Tree’s high-growth, high return on capital employed, asset-light business. The brokerage expects Lemon Tree to emerge as a zero-debt platform, free from a leveraged ownership structure, while Warburg’s Rs 960 crore committed infusion is seen as a key driver of Fleur’s growth. Investec also said that management’s reaffirmation of its growth strategy adds comfort for shareholders. Lemon Tree Hotels' management has indicated that Fleur Hotels will be listed as a separate entity within the next 12 to 15 months, and that Lemon Tree will announce a dividend distribution policy after the scheme is completed.

Hindustan Zinc shares jump 3% as silver futures hit fresh record high of nearly Rs 2.64 lakh/kg; silver ETFs rise 4%,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hindustan-zinc-shares-jump-3-as-silver-futures-hit-fresh-record-high-of-nearly-rs-2-64-lakh-kg-silver-etfs-rise-4-13767830.html,"The shares of Hindustan Zinc jumped more than 3 percent on January 12 as silver prices rebounded after a sharp plunge earlier last week. Silver ETFs also mirrored the sharp rise in silver prices, jumping around 3 percent each. Hindustan Zinc shares rose to Rs 625 apiece in the early trading hours of Monday. The company is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity. Silver prices hit fresh lifetime highs: Silver futures with March expiry on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) jumped around 5 percent to a fresh lifetime high of Rs 2,63,996 per kilogram. This marks a jump of Rs 11,271 per kg in just one session. The future contracts with May expiry jumped more than 4 percent to an all-time high of Rs 2,70,054 per kg, while those with July expiry rose nearly 4 percent to a lifetime high of Rs 2,77,924 per kg. Spot silver meanwhile soared to a fresh lifetime high of $83.96 per ounce. Fresh geopolitical tensions, tariff threats and a criminal probe into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may have boosted the appeal of the safe-haven assets like precious metals. Unrest in Iran has killed more than 500 people, a rights group said on Sunday, as Tehran threatened to target US military bases if President Donald Trump carries out his renewed threats to strike the country on behalf of protesters. Fed Chair Powell meanwhile said on Sunday that the Trump administration had threatened him with a criminal indictment over Congressional testimony, an action Powell called a ""pretext"" aimed at putting further pressure on the central bank to lower rates. Investors currently expect at least two Fed rate cuts this year. Non-yielding assets tend to do well in a low-interest-rate environment and during geopolitical or economic uncertainties. Silver ETFs: Silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) mirrored the rise in silver prices. Zerodha Silver ETF jumped more than 4 percent, while UTI Silver ETF, DSP Silver ETF, Axis Silver ETF, ICICI Pru Silver ETF, Nippon Silver ETF, Motilal Oswal Silver ETF, SBI Silver ETF, Mirae Asset Silver ETF, Tata Silver ETF, HDFC Silver ETF, and others gained nearly 4 percent each. These ETFs have delivered returns of up to 176 percent over the past one year as silver prices skyrocketed in 2025. Hindustan Zinc share price: Hindustan Zinc shares fell more than 3 percent in the past five days as silver prices saw some profit booking last week. The stock is however up around 10 percent in the past one month, and over 41 percent in the past six months. The stock has jumped over 125 percent in the past five years. Its P/E ratio currently stands at more than 24. The company has a market capitalization of Rs 2,60,871 crore. What lies ahead? US President Donald Trump is considering imposing steep tariffs, potentially as high as 500 percent, on countries that continue to buy Russian oil. Senator Lindsey Graham said the sanctions would give Trump leverage over major buyers such as China, India, and Brazil, pressuring them to halt purchases of discounted Russian crude that helps finance the war in Ukraine. Given the potential impact on key Russian energy customers, the move could escalate US–China trade tensions, supporting safe-haven demand for gold and silver, said Kaynat Chainwala, AVP Commodity Research, Kotak Securities. Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead at VT Markets however advised caution. ""Industrial demand, especially from green technologies, underpins long-term fundamentals in silver’s high pricing. Short-term rallies often attract rapid inflows that can reverse quickly, leading to sharp pullbacks. If bullish speculative sentiment fades or macro risk appetite returns, silver could correct significantly. A period of volatility is likely, with sharp swings possible. Whilst a prolonged crash isn’t inevitable, we would need to see broader market sentiment turn decisively risk-on,"" he said.

DMart stock outlook turns cautious after Q3 results: Brokerages offer guarded calls despite margin beat,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/dmart-stock-outlook-turns-cautious-after-q3-results-brokerages-offer-guarded-calls-despite-margin-beat-13767653.html,"Brokerages are largely cautious to bearish on Avenue Supermarts (DMart) after its Q3 FY26 results. Citi advised investors to ‘sell’ on slowing same-store growth and fragile margin drivers, while Jefferies and Nuvama recommend to ‘hold’ DMart shares, signalling limited upside despite an earnings beat driven by a sharp margin expansion. DMart stock ended Friday at Rs 3,807, up 0.45 percent ahead of results, valuing the company at about Rs 2.48 lakh crore. Over the past year, the shares have gained around 8.5 percent. Q3 snapshot: margins lift earnings, growth stays muted For the October-December quarter, DMart reported 17 percent year-on-year growth in net profit to Rs 856 crore and 13.3 percent revenue growth to Rs 18,101 crore. EBITDA rose 20.2 percent to Rs 1,463 crore, with margins improving to 8.1 percent from 7.7 percent a year ago. However, same-store (LFL) growth slowed to 5.6 percent, a key concern across brokerages. Citi: ‘Sell’ on growth slowdown and margin risk Citi has a ‘Sell’ rating on DMart with a target price of Rs 3,150 per share. It said same-store growth slowed to 5.6 percent, driving 13 percent year-on-year revenue growth that came in below its estimates, with staples deflation partly weighing on revenue growth. While it acknowledged that EBITDA and profit rose 20 percent and 18 percent year-on-year and slightly beat estimates, Citi cautioned that margin sustainability remains a risk. It argued that gross margin expansion could be a one-off, linked to FMCG discounts or lower discounting post GST changes. Citi also pointed to a pattern where profit growth lagged revenue growth in 10 of the last 12 quarters, attributing pressure to quick commerce competition and cost inflation. Jefferies, Nuvama: ‘Hold’ calls reflect caution, not comfort Jefferies maintained a ‘Hold’ rating with a target of Rs 4,050, acknowledging the margin-led earnings surprise but underlining moderating revenue growth and subdued LFL trends. It also pointed to execution risks around store additions and the upcoming CEO transition. Nuvama retained a Hold with a target of Rs 4,351, saying profit growth was largely margin-driven, helped by reduced discounting. While it flagged a revival in DMart Ready growth, it tweaked FY26-27 estimates to reflect slower growth and a sharper margin focus.

Bloomberg’s gauge of the US currency dropped as much as 0.2% as Powell said the central bank had been served grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department threatening a criminal indictment over renovations of the Fed’s headquarters. Gold gained as much as 2%, while the Swiss franc, seen as a haven, rose as much as 0.5%. US equity futures fell. “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions — or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,” Powell said in a statement. Asian equities rose after US jobs data helped push stocks to new highs on Friday. Shares in Australia and South Korea and equity index futures for Hong Kong all gained, taking their guide from the S&P 500, which climbed 0.6% on Friday to close at an all-time high. Japanese financial markets are shut Monday for a holiday, which means there will be no trading of cash US Treasuries in Asia. The rally in US equities Friday followed largely benign employment data that showed slightly fewer workers were added to the economy than economists forecast, while the jobless rate edged down to 4.4%.

The level of uncertainty in so many geopolitical hotspots is reaching levels not seen since the late 1930s,” Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co., wrote in a client note. “It’s amazing how much complacency exists in the global stock markets right now.” Asian tech shares may get a boost after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported revenue late last week that topped estimates, offering fresh support for the AI trade in the region.

Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities Ipca Laboratories | CMP: Rs 1,575 On the weekly chart, Ipca Laboratories has experienced a trend reversal by confirming a “triangular” breakout at the Rs 1,519 level on a closing basis. This breakout has been accompanied by huge volumes, signalling increased participation. The daily and weekly Bollinger Band signals indicate increased price movement. The stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100- and 200-day SMAs, which reconfirms the bullish trend. The daily, weekly and monthly strength RSI is in positive territory, signalling rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,700, Rs 1,825 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,519 MTAR Technologies | CMP: Rs 2,689.7 MTAR Technologies is trending higher, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms, indicating a strong uptrend. Over the past 3–5 months, rising volumes indicate increased participation. The daily Bollinger Band signals indicate increased price movement. The stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100- and 200-day SMAs, and these averages are also inching up along with rising prices, which reconfirms a bullish trend. The daily, weekly and monthly strength RSI is in positive territory, signalling rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,900, Rs 3,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,500 HDFC AMC | CMP: Rs 2,523.4 On the daily and weekly charts, HDFC AMC is trending lower, forming lower tops and bottoms, indicating a negative bias. In addition, the stock is sustaining below its 20-, 50-, 100- and 200-day SMAs, which reconfirms a short- and medium-term downtrend. The daily, weekly and monthly strength RSI is in negative territory, signalling a loss of strength. Short-term traders should consider exiting long positions and selling January futures. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 2,460, Rs 2,360 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,600 Osho Krishan, Chief Manager - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One Fortis Healthcare | CMP: Rs 903 Fortis Healthcare has experienced a strong resurgence over the past few weeks, followed by a breather that has retraced nearly 50 percent of the rally. Technically, the counter has formed a higher-highs pattern accompanied by a ‘Cup & Handle’ breakout, and sustainability above the 200 DEMA represents a potential trend-reversal scenario from a short- to medium-term perspective. Additionally, the SuperTrend parameter indicates a bullish outlook after an extended period of correction, signalling a turnaround and adding to the bullish case. Hence, we recommend buying Fortis Healthcare around Rs 900–890. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 960 Stop-Loss: Rs 870 Equitas Small Finance Bank | CMP: Rs 66.87 Equitas Small Finance Bank has shown significant buying momentum from the cluster of EMAs around the 60 sub-zone and has surpassed the sloping trendline, indicating the onset of a bullish trend. From a technical perspective, the MACD histogram has demonstrated buying momentum, moving above the signal line and creating a positive crossover. Furthermore, the EMAs are approaching positive crossovers, suggesting that this upward momentum is likely to continue in the near future. Hence, we recommend buying Equitas Small Finance Bank around Rs 64. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 74, Rs 80 Stop-Loss: Rs 57 Kalyan Jewellers India | CMP: Rs 506.9 Kalyan Jewellers has demonstrated substantial consolidation near its significant EMAs. Additionally, the counter has showcased a ‘Symmetrical Triangle’ breakout, backed by increased trading volumes, suggesting growth potential in the forthcoming period. The technical indicators are also strongly aligned with price momentum, indicating a bullish outlook for the near term. Hence, we recommend buying Kalyan Jewellers around Rs 500–495, with a stop-loss at Rs 470, targeting Rs 545–560. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 545, Rs 560 Stop-Loss: Rs 470 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments Asian Paints | CMP: Rs 2,825.5 Asian Paints, after delivering a 52-week breakout and a sharp 14 percent follow-through move, is now undergoing a healthy retest of its rising 10-week moving average. The consolidation has taken the shape of a tight four-week box near the Rs 2,800 zone, indicating controlled price action rather than distribution. Volumes have picked up over the past two weeks, highlighting relative strength even as the broader market weakens. This behaviour suggests strong hands are defending the trend. The broader structure remains intact, with moving averages aligning as a potential launchpad. A sustained move above the Rs 2,800–2,850 zone can reignite momentum and open an immediate upside toward Rs 3,200, while a decisive break below the 10-week average would be the key invalidation. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,750. Lupin | CMP: Rs 2,182.2 Lupin has delivered a decisive breakout after nearly 491 weeks and has since spent 58 weeks building a strong base-on-base structure, signalling long-term trend renewal. The consolidation phase has been marked by steady institutional accumulation, indicating conviction rather than speculative churn. Weekly moving averages are now fanning out positively, reflecting rising momentum and improving trend strength across timeframes. The final overhead hurdle sits near Rs 2,200, and a clean breach above this level would unlock a larger pattern target toward Rs 3,000. In the near term, Rs 2,500 remains an intermediate resistance where some supply may emerge. Risk–reward remains favourable as long as the price holds above the upper base, keeping the primary bullish structure intact. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,500, Rs 3,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,000 IDFC First Bank | CMP: Rs 86 IDFC First Bank has delivered a decisive breakout from a massive 756-week cup-and-handle formation, clearing the key pivot near Rs 83 and confirming strength above the long-standing Rs 84.5 resistance. The breakout was supported by above-average institutional volumes, signalling conviction rather than short covering. Moving averages across timeframes have fanned out cleanly, reinforcing trend alignment, while the first retest post-breakout has been successfully absorbed, validating the structure. A sustained hold above Rs 84.5 keeps the bullish thesis intact and opens the door to fresh all-time highs beyond Rs 100.37. From a pattern perspective, a 10 percent extension toward the Rs 108–110 zone appears highly probable if momentum continues. Any dip toward the breakout zone is likely to find strong demand unless the stock slips back below Rs 83, which would act as the key invalidation level.

Global AI race shows Asia leading as stocks start 2026 with a bang,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/global-ai-race-shows-asia-leading-as-stocks-start-2026-with-a-bang-13766862.html,"Asia’s technology stocks began 2026 on a tear, with investors betting their momentum and outperformance against US peers will last through the year. Strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are overweight and expect further gains driven partly by surging artificial intelligence-related demand and reasonable valuations. Citigroup Inc. says global long-term investors are accumulating Asia’s tech stocks given their importance in the semiconductor supply chain and the potential for earnings upside. A key Asia tech gauge has jumped about 6% so far this year, beating a 2% gain in the Nasdaq 100, as investors rotate toward the region at the core of the global semiconductor supply chain. The shift reflects growing skepticism that US tech can sustain its AI-driven rally after years of outsized gains. Strong fundamentals are reinforcing the move. Samsung Electronics Co. last week posted preliminary operating profit that more than tripled to a record and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s revenue exceeded estimates. Stellar stock market debuts of Chinese AI firms are also adding to the optimism. “This really comes down to a shift in where investors see the best risk-reward right now,” said Dilin Wu, a research strategist at Pepperstone Group Ltd. in Australia. “US tech is like a mature gold mine — already rich in value. Asian tech, on the other hand, is like an under-explored mine — still undervalued but fundamentally strong, ready to reward those who notice it.” The MSCI Asia Pacific Information Technology Index is trading at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 16.3 times, compared with about 25 times for the Nasdaq 100 Index and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. That’s even as the Asian gauge has outperformed the Nasdaq by 33 percentage points since the end of 2024, and the Philadelphia measure by about two percentage points. A variety of money managers are investing in Asia tech as they set their portfolios for 2026. George Molina, head of trading at Templeton Global Investments, notes a mix of hedge‑fund, long‑only and passive demand into the cohort, notably in Korea and Hong Kong. In Japan, he sees investors who trimmed AI exposure into year-end adding back. The flows are boosting share prices. TSMC, Samsung and its South Korean peer SK Hynix Inc. — three of Asia’s biggest tech stocks — have already surged between 8% and 16% this year. In Hong Kong, shares of chipmaker Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd. are up more than 20%. Earnings Potential Another major reason behind the bullishness is higher earnings growth potential. Aggregate earnings-per-share for companies part of the equity benchmarks in South Korea and Taiwan — Asia’s two tech-heavy markets — are seen climbing 79% and 36%, respectively, over the next 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s versus a forecast of 28% growth for Nasdaq firms. With Samsung’s preliminary results — boosted by higher memory prices — out of the way, attention now turns to TSMC’s full-year earnings this week. Expectations of improving profitability have already seen about half a dozen brokerages raise their price targets for the stock since the start of the year. Amid all this positive sentiment, Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee in Singapore, says the main risks for Asian chipmakers are a pulllback in AI spending and geopolitics, especially for Taiwan. Concerns have been mounting over the hundreds of billions of dollars Big Tech has pledged to spend on AI infrastructure. Capital expenditures from Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are expected to rise 34% to roughly $440 billion over the next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. China Tech Meanwhile, China is another key element of investing in Asia tech. Enthusiasm over the nation’s tech prowess has only grown in the new year, buoyed by DeepSeek’s paper outlining a more efficient approach to developing AI, the rising global popularity of Kuaishou Technology’s video editing AI model and Beijing’s self-sufficiency drive. Earnings growth for a gauge of China’s tech megacaps is poised for a major inflection point in 2026 when it’s expected to overtake Magnificent 7 for the first time since 2022, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Also underpinning the buoyant sentiment is a growing pipeline of AI-related companies looking to list in Hong Kong and mainland China. Last week alone saw listings by two firms that are seen as challengers to global sector leaders including OpenAI. “AI is a multi-year global growth driver, and North Asia’s technology ecosystem spanning hardware, software, and infrastructure positions the region at the forefront of this trend,” said Gary Tan, a portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments in Singapore.",Citigroup Inc. says global long-term investors are accumulating Asia’s tech stocks given their importance in the semiconductor supply chain and the potential for earnings upside.,"That’s even as the Asian gauge has outperformed the Nasdaq by 33 percentage points since the end of 2024, and the Philadelphia measure by about two percentage points.","Asia’s technology stocks began 2026 on a tear, with investors betting their momentum and outperformance against US peers will last through the year.","Enthusiasm over the nation’s tech prowess has only grown in the new year, buoyed by DeepSeek’s paper outlining a more efficient approach to developing AI, the rising global popularity of Kuaishou Technology’s video editing AI model and Beijing’s self-sufficiency drive.",positive,0.9435511827468872
90 smallcaps sink in double digits as index underperforms,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/90-smallcaps-sink-in-double-digits-as-index-underperforms-13766799.html,"Broader market indices remained under pressure during the week, with mid- and large-cap indices declining around 2.5 percent each, while the small-cap index fell nearly 4 percent, significantly underperforming the benchmark indices. The markets posted their worst weekly performance in over three months, weighed down by rising geopolitical tensions, persistent FII selling, and concerns over potential US tariffs. BSE Sensex index slipped 2,185.77 points or 2.54 percent at 83,576.24, while Nifty50 index shed 193.55 points or 2.45 percent at 25,683.30. Sectorally, Nifty Oil & Gas, Nifty Energy, and Nifty Infra indices declined 4–5 percent during the week. Nifty Metal, Realty, Media, and Auto indices also remained under pressure, each slipping more than 2 percent. In contrast, the Nifty Defence index gained 1.3 percent, while the Nifty Consumer Durables index rose 1 percent. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued to remain net sellers during the week, offloading equities worth Rs 9,209.90 crore. In contrast, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) provided support to the market, purchasing equities worth Rs 17,594.58 crore. ""Indian equities navigated the first full week of 2026 with caution, reflecting a corrective undertone. The week began on a muted note as expectations of higher government borrowing drove bond yields upward, though strong GST collections and healthy bank credit growth provided some support. Market sentiment, however, weakened amid global headwinds, including the Venezuela–US standoff, concerns over Russian oil imports, China’s restrictions on rare earth exports, and continued FII outflows,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""Profit-booking in autos, metals, and oil & gas weighed on indices, while selective buying in consumer durables, on hopes of a demand revival, offered brief respite. The week ended on a cautious tone ahead of U.S. Supreme Court rulings on tariffs, with fears of additional levies under Russian sanctions overshadowing optimism around earnings recovery."" ""Looking ahead, clarity on global trade dynamics and Q3 earnings will shape market direction. Volatility is likely to persist in the near term, particularly in US exposed companies and sectors such as metals and oil & gas. However, strong domestic fundamentals, resilient GDP growth and robust credit trends, could underpin selective buying where earnings prospects remain favourable."" ""FII flows and currency movements will act as key monitorable, while any positive outcome from India–US trade discussions or easing tariff concerns could spark a short-term rebound. Overall, markets are expected to stay range-bound with a mixed bias, looking forth a balance between external risks and domestic fundamentals,"" he said further. The BSE Small-cap index declined nearly 4 percent during the week, with heavy selling seen across several stocks. Shares of Systematix Corporate Services, Balu Forge Industries, Worth Investment & Trading, VTM, Kiri Industries, Sai Silks Kalamandir, Indian Metals & Ferro Alloys, Transformers and Rectifiers India, Stallion India Fluorochemicals, Wardwizard Innovations and Mobility, Baazar Style Retail, Elecon Engineering Company, Kitex Garments, Faze Three, and Sandur Manganese and Iron Ores tumbled between 15 and 23 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty has slipped further, moving lower from the 50 EMA, indicating increasing weakness. Bouts of selling pressure dragged the index to close at a several-day low. Market sentiment appears decisively negative. In the short term, the trend might remain weak, with potential downside towards 25,550–25,500. On the higher end, resistance is placed at 25,850. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Nifty continued to slide down on Friday and closed the day lower by 193 points. After opening on a weak note, the market slipped into further weakness that continued for better part of the session. Minor recovery was seen towards the end and Nifty closed near the lows. A long bear candle was formed on the daily chart with minor lower shadow. Technically, this market action indicates a sharp down trended movement in the market. A long bear candle was formed on the weekly chart that signals sharp reversal in the market after the consolidation movement of few weeks. This is not a good sign and indicates more weakness in the coming week. The underlying trend of Nifty continues to be weak. A slide below the support of 25700 could open more decline down to 25400 in the coming week. Immediate resistance is placed at 25900. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Market sentiment stayed subdued amid elevated geopolitical and global trade-related concerns, particularly renewed uncertainty around potential U.S. tariff actions and related Supreme Court developments. Persistent foreign institutional selling and weakness across broader risk assets further compounded the negative bias, while heavyweights also added to the downside pressure. From a technical perspective, the decline has disrupted the short-term up move in the Nifty, with the index now retesting its medium-term support zone near the 100 DEMA around the 25,600 level. A decisive break below this could invite further pressure towards the 25,450 and 25,300 levels. On the upside, reclaiming the short-term moving average, i.e., the 20 DEMA around 26,000, may prove challenging.

Wall Street’s risk-on fever shows no signs of abating in new year,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/wall-street-s-risk-on-fever-shows-no-signs-of-abating-in-new-year-13766424.html,"Wall Street’s risk complex is booming anew. In the first full week of 2026, a synchronized cross-asset rally — from meme stocks and high-yield bonds to small-company shares — shows no sign of slowing. US stocks closed at all-time highs, marking a heady start to the year, fueled by signs of fresh economic momentum, productivity gains and a benign inflation outlook. That backdrop has powered advances in cyclical sectors, commodities and speculative assets alike. No single event triggered the move. But a run of stronger-than-expected data has helped shape a growing sense that economic conditions are improving. It’s a view echoed by strategists at the likes of Nomura Securities International, who cite resilient employment, rising shipping rates and firm auto demand, among other factors, as drivers of the shift. Investors are moving out of last year’s safe bets and tech giants into riskier parts of the market that typically lead in early economic upswings. Even without firm signals on major policy questions — from Trump-era tariffs to the Federal Reserve’s next move — markets rallied sharply on the week. Shares tied to industrial growth jumped. Metal prices climbed. And demand for semiconductors — used in cars, appliances and factory equipment — remains strong, suggesting broad economic vigor. The rally has also been fueled by Washington. President Donald Trump unveiled new support for the housing market, giving fresh momentum to already-strong credit and property sectors. “It really doesn’t work to be overly defensive,” said Julie Biel, portfolio manager at Kayne Anderson Rudnick. “There’s too much sugar coming into the economy.” Still, buoyant speculative spirits — three years into a bull market in which the S&P 500 has nearly doubled — strike some as oddly timed. The good cheer seems wishful, said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. “You have Intel up 10% and registering new highs because the CEO met with the president,” said O’Rourke, who also pointed to Friday’s run-up in mortgage originators following Trump’s plan to bolster credit markets. “On a daily basis stocks are rising 10% to 20% on tertiary news developments or the recycling of themes that have been playing out for months.” Investors’ hunger for risk has been visible across the board. The S&P 500 gained 1.6% this week and the Russell 2000 jumped 4.6%. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) attracted $10 billion in just a few days — a blistering pace for a passive fund. A meme-stock ETF soared nearly 15% while a basket of the most-shorted companies advanced 7%. Credit markets joined in. Junk bond spreads narrowed by 10 basis points, juicing fresh corporate borrowings. Even some memecoins — long seen as a bellwether for speculative excess — are rebounding after last year’s collapse. “The broadening is justified given the better economic data, especially with respect to more sectors and countries across the world performing well,” said Sameer Samana, head of global equities and real assets at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “We are still a little skeptical on going too far down the market-cap stack.” Rather than confining themselves to a handful of all-weather tech megacaps, investors are betting on real economic strength. Industrial production is picking up. Car sales beat expectations in December, even as dealership inventory shrank and automakers offered fewer discounts — a sign of firm demand. US services activity expanded in December at the fastest pace in more than a year, defying gloomier readings elsewhere. Labor productivity rose at the fastest rate in two years, helping to contain employment costs. And in semiconductors, long a proxy for industrial demand, Microchip Technology raised its forecast, citing stronger-than-expected sales of chips that power the physical economy. “Accommodative monetary policy along with robust fiscal support continues to provide a favorable backdrop,” said Nathan Thooft, chief investment officer at Manulife Investment Management, which oversees $160 billion. “We are expecting economic activity to improve in the second quarter and beyond in 2026 driven by the previously mentioned drivers, the lag effect of monetary stimulus, and tax refunds benefiting the lower income cohort.” While Friday’s employment report spurred another bout of buying in stocks, the data was soggy enough to keep some market observers from declaring a full-blown revival in growth. Nonfarm payrolls rose by just 50,000 last month, missing forecasts, after the prior two months were revised lower, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.4%, settling back after the record-long government shutdown. “I don’t think I would go as far as to say ‘re-acceleration’ in the economy, since hiring trends are still weak,” said Priya Misra, a portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management. “However, GDP of 2-3% and a stable unemployment rate this year should be cheered by markets.”","And in semiconductors, long a proxy for industrial demand, Microchip Technology raised its forecast, citing stronger-than-expected sales of chips that power the physical economy.","“You have Intel up 10% and registering new highs because the CEO met with the president,” said O’Rourke, who also pointed to Friday’s run-up in mortgage originators following Trump’s plan to bolster credit markets.","Nonfarm payrolls rose by just 50,000 last month, missing forecasts, after the prior two months were revised lower, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.","“We are expecting economic activity to improve in the second quarter and beyond in 2026 driven by the previously mentioned drivers, the lag effect of monetary stimulus, and tax refunds benefiting the lower income cohort.” While Friday’s employment report spurred another bout of buying in stocks, the data was soggy enough to keep some market observers from declaring a full-blown revival in growth.",positive,0.8115808367729187
How smart money trades before the Budget: Shubham Agarwal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/expert-columns/how-smart-money-trades-before-the-budget-shubham-agarwal-13765221.html,"January stands apart as the most intriguing month for traders. Two forces shape the market during this period: quarterly results and the Union Budget tabled on February 1. After New Year, Foreign Institutional Investors start positioning themselves ahead of the budget. Traders at every level begin placing their bets on policy decisions, armed with whatever knowledge or information they possess. The timing of these positions varies wildly. It depends on your experience and how well you read participant behavior before budget season. During January, market trends blur. Indices and stocks throw fake breakouts. Whispers of budget policies create optimism about various sectors, triggering strong sector rotation. Money flows from one sector to another, creating sharp rallies in stocks but weak follow-throughs. Most of the time, the market remains range-bound. The question becomes: how do you trade this chaos? In January, option prices turn expensive. Consider this example. On January 1st, 2025, weekly ATM options (both Call and Put) with 9 days to expiry traded at Rs 200-220. Near budget time, January 28th, 2025, similar weekly ATM options with 9 days to expiry jumped to Rs 350-360. This expensive nature stems from higher expected volatility. Market participants anticipate larger moves due to budget policy decisions. Retail traders buy both Calls and Puts, creating huge demand. As demand rises, options become costlier than normal. So what should you do? Price movements turn erratic before the budget. But one thing stays clear: option prices become expensive (Volatility increases). You can benefit from this by going long straddle, buying an ATM Call and Put. This works in your favor if options become expensive (volatility rises) or if the market makes a bigger directional move. What's the risk? You cannot predict exactly when options will become expensive. You need to analyze past data to figure out the probable timing. The biggest risk is daily option price decay, also known as theta decay. The longer you stay in the trade, the more premium erodes. If you don't get the volatility rise within 3 days, take the loss and exit, or keep a suitable stop loss. For directional traders, stick to short-term trades. Book profits whenever they appear. Don't expect big positional moves. What not to do? Avoid pure short straddles and strangles in January. These strategies carry unlimited risk potential, especially when options are expensive. The second rookie mistake: buying an ATM Call and Put 1 or 2 days before the budget, hoping for a huge move on budget day. By that time, options have already peaked in price or sit near peak levels. Straddle buying at this stage produces negative outcomes most of the time. Here's the key insight: smart money doesn't try to forecast the market or predict policy decisions during budget time. Instead, they observe patterns. They watch how retail traders behave, how positioning builds up, and how volatility evolves through the month. From these observations, they build consistent, repeatable strategies. They don't gamble on outcomes. They bet on behavior.

The company is consolidating its operations in Vadodara, with US headcount slashed by over 80 percent, labs reduced from four to two sites, and overall workforce dropping 40 percent to around 246 by FY27 from 409 in FY24, driving R&D spend down to $14.3 million in FY25 from $20.4 million previously. SPARC, which focused on drug discovery and development, is backed by Dilip Shanghvi and his family and has synergies with parent Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, while also relying on revenue from out-licensed products. The long R&D cycles require significant investment and occasional borrowing or cost optimization.

The case will decide whether Trump can invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to levy tariffs without congressional approval. During arguments in November, the justices indicated scepticism over Trump’s authority to impose such duties. Analysts said export-linked stocks could see a rally if the court strikes down the tariffs, though they cautioned that alternative policy measures could limit the upside. Ajit Mishra, senior vice-president (research) at Religare Broking, said export-oriented stocks had seen a recent rebound on expectations of relief from the US Supreme Court. ""However, we believe market participants should temper their expectations, as the US government has planned other legislative measures to maintain or even raise tariffs in the event of an adverse ruling. Moreover, the recent weakness in broader markets further underscores the need for caution at current levels,"" Mishra added. Trump Tariffs Supreme Court Hearing Date Today Over 900 lawsuits had been filed in the US Supreme Court on behalf of businesses seeking tariff refunds, according to a tally compiled by Bloomberg. Company executives, customs brokers and trade lawyers are now bracing for the ruling, which can open up the possibility of obtaining perhaps $150 billion in refunds from the US government for duties already paid by importers in case Trump loses. Why $150 billion refunds are at stake Shares of Gokaldas Exports rose nearly 3 percent to Rs 642.5 on the NSE. More than 60 percent of the company’s revenue comes from the US market. According to BSE Analytics data, the stock is down nearly 41 percent over the past one year. KPR Mill shares fell 3 percent to Rs 826.7, while Pearl Global Industries gained about 2 percent to Rs 1,522. Avanti Feeds shares declined more than 2 percent, and Apex Frozen Foods fell nearly 6 percent to Rs 260.25. Sunny Agrawal, Head of Fundamental Research at SBI Securities, said ""The overhang of Trump’s tariffs is likely to continue on export-related businesses such as Gokaldas, Avanti Feeds, among others."" ""Today’s U.S. Supreme Court hearing can have multiple takeaways. In the first scenario, the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down Trump’s tariffs. In that case, the U.S. President can challenge the ruling, and the tariffs may continue for a longer period, so the overhang remains. In the second scenario, there is no clear ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court; in that case, too, the tariffs continue on all such businesses. In the third scenario, the U.S. Supreme Court gives a decision in favour of Trump’s tariffs; in that case as well, tariffs may continue on all export-led Indian businesses. I think that in all three scenarios, the overhang will continue until India and the U.S. formally come together to roll back the extra tariffs that the U.S. has imposed on India for importing Russian crude oil."" These stocks have seen sharp volatility in recent months as they derive a large portion of their revenues from the US market. The pressure intensified after Trump raised tariffs on Indian imports to 50 percent, citing India’s purchase of Russian oil. Shares also reacted to Trump’s approval to move forward with a bipartisan sanctions bill proposing a 500 percent tariff on countries continuing to do business with Russia, including India, China and Brazil.

Nifty 50 dosed at 25,876.85, down 1.01% while Sensex fell 0.92% to 84,180.96. in broader markets, Nifty Midcap 100 declined 1.98% while India VIX spiked, signaling rising near-term volatility. Analysts are, therefore, factoring in about 2% of fall in markets because of this knee jerk reactions, while suggesting investors to buy this dip. Sectoral impact Public sector units (PSUs) and metal stocks led the decline. BHEL was down 8.78%, Hindalco declined 3.78% while ONGC fell over 3%. Among IT stocks, Wipro was down 3.3%. Selective gainers included ICICI Bank and Dixon Technologies, showing buying interest in high-quality domestic-consumption stocks, persistent with 2025's market sentiments including the milestone GST cut. Markets reacted to reports that US President Donald Trump had backed the Sanctioning Russia Act, a bipartisan bill proposing tariffs of up to 500% on countries continuing to import Russian oil or uraniurn. India, as the world's second-largest buyer of discounted Russian crude, was explicitly highlighted. Who takes the first hit ""If tariffs are imposed, which is still a low-probability outcome, the first balance sheet impact will fall on PSU oil marketing companies. Their costs would rise as they are forced to buy non-Russian crude at higher prices. They cannot pass on the full increase to consumers, resulting in margin compression and under-recoveries,"" said one of the analysts on an off-record basis. With Russian crude accounting for over 35% of imports, India's next step would be to shift onto costlier alternatives, such as from Brazil, and West Asia. Regarding crude economics, ""Indian refiners are already diversifying, but when discounts are around $5 to 6 per barrel, the economics of the deal dominate. Based on shipping flow data, a fall below roughly $4, will weaken the risk-reward ratio materially."" He goes on to add, ""Structurally, Indian refiners are positioned to handle bad-quality crude, so logistics and supply chain issues are not a concern."" Analysts also believe that at the moment, the market is pricing risk exposure, not an operational breakdown. ""The setback is not an oil supply shock, India has enough refining capacity and can process diverse crude grades. The only disadvantage is the loss of arbitrage from discounted Russian oil. Structurally, Indian refiners are positioned to handle bad-quality crude, so logistics and supply chain issues are not a concern,"" said Shailendra Kumar, CIO and co-founder of Nanolia He doesn't expect immediate impacts on broad macro indicators or the trade deficit. ""Brent crude price could rise modestly, say $60 to $75 per barrel, but this is not calamitous. The market may overprice the risk in the short term,"" he added. Analysts point out the real risk drivers Secondary points of friction are shipping insurance, trade finance, and dollar settlement channels. The sectors they are exposed to are PSUs, metal stocks, energy-linked names. Valuation gaps: Mid-cap and small-cap segments remain vulnerable into 2026, while large-cap indices have already absorbed prior corrections. ""The first quarter could see front loaded volatility. Mid-and small-cap stocks may correct 6 to 7% before stabilising. By April, once earnings and trade clarity emerge, markets could recover to 15 to 16% year-on-year gains,"" Kumar said. Analysts find it likely that if push comes to shove and Russian crude has to be reduced further, discounted Venezuelan crude could enter India's sourcing mix in limited volumes, provided sanctions are lifted. Buffering factors While sentiments might extrapolate on US playing a significant role as an export destination for India, it accounts for 18% of India's exports. Given India's strong macro fundamentals, domestic consumption-led sectors (FMCG, banks, infrastructure) remain largely insulated. Further, factoring in the possible risks will also open doors to diversification opportunities across Middle East, ASEAN, and Europe. Thus, acting as shock absorbers. ""Markets are currently more sensitive to headlines than fundamentals, Long term, India's economy od corporate earnings growth are healthy, Short-term volatility is a risk pricing exercise, not a structural breakdown, highlighted another industry analyst. ""Long-term fundamentals are intact. Short-term volatility is front-loaded; markets may reboutid once clarity on sanctions and trade treaties emerges,"" remains Kumar's stance. Upcoming events to monitor US Supreme Court / Senate hearings on the Sanctioning Russia Act (expected in February). Arrival of new US ambassador to India (January 12), expected to clarify the US stance. India-European trade treaty developments (possible February signing), which could reduce perceived geopolitical risk.

The stock was trading at Rs 280.75, up 3.31 percent in early deals. The recovery follows Thursday’s nearly 9 percent decline, when BHEL had hit the lower circuit intraday after reports suggested India may ease curbs on Chinese firms bidding for government contracts -- sparking a broad sell-off across capital-goods stocks. Buying interest returned on Friday after UBS initiated a ‘Buy’ call on BHEL with a target price of Rs 375 per share, implying over 35 percent upside from Thursday’s closing levels.

The brokerage has set a target price of Rs 117 per share, implying an upside of over 42 percent from Thursday’s closing level of Rs 82. NHPC stock call: CLSA says capacity expansion to aid jump in profit At the heart of CLSA’s bullish view is its expectation that FY26 will mark an inflection point for NHPC’s scale and growth trajectory. The brokerage believes the company’s installed capacity could rise by as much as 64 percent year-on-year in FY26, setting the stage for a stronger earnings profile over the medium term. CLSA expects this expansion phase to translate into a sharp improvement in profitability. The brokerage projects nearly 90 percent growth in earnings per share over FY25-27. The brokerage added that FY26 should solidify NHPC’s decadal growth story as long-pending projects begin contributing meaningfully. Recent corporate actions have also added to investor interest in the stock. NHPC’s board has approved fund-raising of up to Rs 2,000 crore through the issuance of non-convertible, non-cumulative AH-Series bonds in one or more tranches via private placement, as part of its FY26 borrowing plan. The move is seen as strengthening the company’s financial flexibility ahead of a heavy execution phase and has been one of the triggers behind recent activity in the stock. Also read | Indian Gold ETFs see $1.25 billion inflows in December, highest ever A key operational catalyst highlighted by CLSA is the full commissioning of the Subansiri Lower Hydro Project -- NHPC’s second-largest project -- by the fourth quarter of FY26. Beyond this, the brokerage expects the award of four hydropower projects and one pumped storage project during 2026, which could further strengthen visibility on long-term growth. NHPC’s recent stock performance has been relatively muted -- up about 5 percent over the past year compared with a roughly 10 percent rise in the Nifty 50. However, CLSA sees NHPC as a scale-up and execution-led opportunity.

What to do with BHEL stock today after a sharp selloff? UBS says ‘buy’ on major order win; check target price,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/what-to-do-with-bhel-stock-today-after-a-sharp-selloff-ubs-says-buy-on-major-order-win-check-target-price-13764551.html,"Shares of Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) will be in focus in Friday’s trade after UBS issued a ‘Buy’ call with a target price of Rs 375 per share, following a sharp selloff triggered by policy-related concerns. UBS’ target price implies over 35 percent upside from Thursday’s closing level. The brokerage’s positive stance comes on the back of strong recent order wins and improving execution visibility, UBS said. BHEL shares had crashed nearly 9 percent on Thursday, hitting a 10 percent lower circuit intraday, after a Reuters report said India is considering scrapping five-year-old restrictions on Chinese companies participating in government tenders. The stock closed at Rs 276.9, wiping out a part of recent gains. However, it remains up about 28 percent over the past one year, well ahead of the Nifty 50’s roughly 10 percent rise. BHEL stock call: Brokerage view positive after recent correction UBS said the recent correction offers a positive read-through for the stock, citing robust order momentum. The brokerage highlighted that BHEL has secured a Rs 5,400-crore coal gasification and raw syngas cleaning plant order, taking its FY26 order inflows to around 60 percent of full-year expectations. The order has been awarded by BCGCL, a joint venture between Coal India and BHEL, for a coal-to-ammonium-nitrate project, marking the first commercial deployment of BHEL’s proprietary Pressurised Fluidised Bed Gasification (PFBG) technology. UBS noted that this represents a shift for the company from R&D to large-scale execution, with a 42-month execution period and 60-month operations and maintenance tenure, strengthening long-term revenue visibility. Also read | Indian Gold ETFs see $1.25 billion inflows in December, highest ever The brokerage’s note comes against the backdrop of heightened investor activity after reports that easing restrictions on Chinese bidders could intensify competition in large government contracts, particularly in power and railways. These concerns had triggered a broad sell-off across capital-goods stocks on Thursday, dragging down peers such as Siemens, ABB India and L&T. However, looking past near-term policy uncertainty, UBS said that BHEL’s improving order book, technology differentiation and execution pipeline place it in a stronger position after the recent decline.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Emcure Pharma, Alkem Laboratories, Indus Towers, Titan, Torrent Pharma, and others on January 9?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-emcure-pharma-alkem-laboratories-indus-towers-titan-torrent-pharma-and-others-on-january-9-13764459.html,"Equity benchmarks dropped 1 percent on January 8, extending the losing streak for the fourth straight session, with bears dominating market breadth. About 2,470 shares declined compared to 439 shares that gained on the NSE. The market is expected to consolidate with range-bound trading after the sharp correction. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Aakash Shah, Research Analyst at Choice Broking Alkem Laboratories | CMP: Rs 5,793 On the daily chart, price action in Alkem Laboratories has formed a descending channel, indicating a corrective move within a broader uptrend rather than a trend reversal. The recent strong bullish candle has broken above the upper trendline of the channel, signalling a resumption of bullish momentum. The stock is trading above the 20 EMA and 50 EMA, both of which are sloping upward, reflecting strengthening short-term and medium-term momentum. The price is also comfortably placed above the 100 EMA and 200 EMA, confirming that the broader trend remains bullish and structurally intact. Volume has expanded on the breakout, supporting the validity of the move, while volumes were relatively muted during the consolidation phase — a classic sign of healthy price digestion before continuation. From a momentum perspective, the RSI is trending above 60, indicating bullish strength without entering extreme overbought territory, leaving room for further upside. Structurally, the Rs 5,550–5,600 zone now acts as a key support area, aligning with the breakout level and short-term moving averages. As long as Alkem holds above this zone, the bullish breakout remains valid and favours continuation toward the Rs 5,900–6,050 resistance zone in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,050 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,550 Supriya Lifescience | CMP: Rs 765 On the daily chart, price action in Supriya Lifescience is forming a rising channel, indicating higher lows and sustained buying interest after the prior impulse move. The recent bounce from the lower boundary of the channel near Rs 720–730 reflects demand absorption and signals continuation potential. The stock is trading above the 20 EMA and 50 EMA, both of which are gradually turning upward, reflecting improving short-term momentum. The price is also holding above the 100 EMA and 200 EMA, confirming that the broader trend remains positive and structurally strong. Volume expanded during the earlier breakout toward the Rs 800 zone, while the current consolidation phase is accompanied by relatively lower volumes, highlighting healthy price digestion rather than distribution. Momentum indicators remain neutral to positive, with the RSI holding above 50, suggesting a bullish bias with scope for further upside as momentum builds. Structurally, the Rs 730 zone acts as a key demand and support area, aligning with the rising trendline and short-term moving averages. As long as Supriya holds above this zone, the bullish structure remains intact and favours continuation toward the Rs 800–830 resistance zone in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 830 Stop-Loss: Rs 730 Emcure Pharmaceuticals | CMP: Rs 1,521.8 On the daily chart, Emcure is indicating a sequence of higher lows and steady accumulation after a breakout from its consolidation phase. The recent breakout above the upper range of consolidation near Rs 1,470–1,500 reflects renewed buying interest and strengthens the continuation outlook. The stock is trading comfortably above its key EMAs, all of which are positively aligned and sloping upward. This EMA structure confirms strong short-term momentum as well as a healthy medium-to-long-term trend, suggesting sustained bullish strength. Volume activity expanded during the recent upside breakout, while prior consolidation phases were marked by relatively muted volumes, indicating healthy price digestion rather than distribution. From a momentum perspective, the RSI is trending above 65, indicating bullish strength without entering extreme overbought territory, leaving room for further upside. From a structural perspective, the Rs 1,430–1,450 zone acts as an important support area, aligning with the short-term EMAs and the prior breakout level. As long as Emcure holds above this support band, the bullish structure remains intact and favours further upside toward the Rs 1,580–1,650 resistance zone in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,650 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,430 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Indus Towers | CMP: Rs 430.85 Indus Towers continues to trade in an upward sequence, forming higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart. The stock is holding comfortably above its key moving averages and remains aligned with the rising Supertrend zone, which continues to act as a reliable support. Recent candles near the Rs 425 area are providing a cushion for the short-term correction. The daily RSI is placed near 61, remaining in the higher zone and indicating sustained strength without any signs of exhaustion. The rate of change indicator also remains in positive territory, supporting the continuation of the ongoing trend. Volumes have remained steady and strong during the advance, suggesting healthy participation. The broader outlook remains favourable. A sustained move above Rs 435 could open the path for further upside toward higher levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 458 Stop-Loss: Rs 414 Ramco Cements | CMP: Rs 1,082.5 Ramco Cements has gradually improved its short-term trend and is now holding above its rising 20-day moving average, while the 50-day average near the Rs 1,040 zone continues to act as a strong base. The stock has been forming higher lows over the past few weeks and is consolidating just below the Rs 1,080–1,090 resistance band. The daily RSI is placed near 64, indicating sustained strength. The MACD continues to move higher and is in positive territory, supporting the ongoing recovery phase. Volumes have remained steady, suggesting measured participation. As long as the stock holds above Rs 1,055, the near-term outlook remains positive. A sustained move above Rs 1,090 could open the path for further upside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,160 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,040 Endurance Technologies | CMP: Rs 2,611.2 Endurance Technologies is inching higher after a prolonged corrective phase and is now attempting to build a base above the Rs 2,550–2,580 zone. The stock is trading close to its short-term moving average and has started forming higher lows on the daily chart. The long-term 200-day moving average remains near the Rs 2,450 area, providing a broader support base. The daily RSI, currently around 42, has moved higher from lower levels, pointing to a gradual improvement in momentum. The MACD remains below the zero line but is flattening, suggesting that downside pressure is easing. Volumes have remained slightly muted but may pick up in the coming sessions. As long as the stock holds above Rs 2,550, the near-term outlook remains steady. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,750 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,530 Aditya Thukral, Founder & Analyst at AT Research & Risk Managers GMR Airports | CMP: Rs 102.51 GMR Airports is in an uptrend, marked by the formation of higher highs and higher lows. It has also exhibited a cup-like rounding pattern and witnessed a breakout from this pattern on November 18, 2025, accompanied by a rise in volumes. Since then, prices have been sustaining above the breakout levels and are currently in a consolidation phase. An uptrend continuation is expected as the consolidation nears completion. The stock is consistently trading above all its major EMAs — the 20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day.

Short-term traders or investors can consider buying in the range of Rs 4,190–4,220, with a stop-loss below Rs 4,078, as breakaway gaps generally do not get filled.

Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,075 Torrent Pharmaceuticals | CMP: Rs 4,026.4 Torrent Pharmaceuticals has given a breakout from a box-like consolidation formed after an uptrend.

The Nifty slipped near the 25,850 mark intraday, weighed down by broad-based selling across sectors, persistent foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows, concerns over potential US tariffs, and rising geopolitical tensions. Tracking weak global cues, domestic markets opened on a subdued note, with the Nifty hovering around 26,100. However, sustained profit booking through the session dragged the index to intraday low at 25,858.45. At close, the Sensex was down 780.18 points or 0.92 percent at 84,180.96, and the Nifty was down 263.90 points or 1.01 percent at 25,876.85.

Click to View More Outlook for January 9 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty has slipped below its rising trendline, clearly indicating a sudden increase in bearish bets. Additionally, the index has moved below 26,000, which had been acting as a psychological support. More importantly, the Nifty has closed below the 50 EMA for the first time in three months, signifying a bearish shift in the trend. A rising India VIX is also pointing to increased panic among market participants. Overall, the setup looks uncomfortable for the bulls. Selling pressure is likely to persist in the near term unless the Nifty moves back above 26,000. On the downside, the index might fall down towards 25,700 and 25,550. Rajesh Bhosale, Equity Technical Analyst, Angel One Once again, the market opened on a negative note, and unlike the previous few sessions, the sell-off intensified as the day progressed. Nifty eventually ended with a sharp cut of around 1%, closing tad below the 25900 mark. Nifty slipped for the fourth consecutive session, thereby erasing all the gains made in the previous week. The bullish Symmetrical Triangle breakout witnessed last Friday now stands negated, as prices slipped below last week’s low. Additionally, the index has seen a bearish breakdown from the rising trendline connecting the higher bottoms of November and December, along with a close below the 50-DEMA, which had acted as a strong support over the past couple of months. The coming session will be crucial, as sustained trading below the 25900 level could open the door for further downside in the week ahead. The next key support is placed around 25700, which marks the December swing low and coincides with the 89-DEMA, followed by 25500, a key retracement level. On the upside, the 26000–26100 zone, coinciding with the 20-DEMA, is seen as immediate resistance, and unless the index regains this zone, the market may continue to remain under pressure. Amid ongoing geopolitical tensions and fresh tariff-related concerns, a broad-based sell-off was witnessed in the midcap space, which had earlier marked its highest close on Wednesday and was showing strong momentum until then. Volatility is likely to remain elevated in the near term, and traders are advised to avoid aggressive positions until there is better stability and clarity on global cues.

BHEL hits 10% lower circuit as report says India may ease curbs on Chinese firms bidding for govt contracts,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bhel-hits-10-lower-circuit-as-report-says-india-plans-to-scrap-curbs-on-chinese-firms-bidding-for-govt-contracts-13763636.html,"BHEL shares hit 10 percent lower circuit limit in January 8 trade after a report said that India plans to scrap curbs on Chinese firms bidding for government contracts. Consequently, shares of Bharat Heavy Electricals hit 10 percent lower circuit to quote at Rs 273.20 apiece. The shares settled at Rs 276.90 per share, down 8.78 percent. The sharp decline was witnessed after a Reuters report that the finance ministry plans to scrap five-year-old restrictions on Chinese firms bidding for government contracts as New Delhi seeks to revive commercial ties in an environment of eased diplomatic and border tensions. BHEL builds, commissions, and supplies equipment for numerous thermal power plants across India, including large supercritical projects (800 MW+), playing a key role in India's energy security by manufacturing turbines, generators, and boilers for state-owned entities like NTPC and private players like Adani Power. Meanwhile, Siemens shares fell over 4% as China's CRRC is also competitor to them in Railway contracts, which could be now allowed to participate in Rail contracts if recommendations of committee are approved as the article suggests. The restrictions had a significant impact wherein months after they were unveiled, China's state-owned CRRC was disqualified from bidding for a $216-million train-manufacturing contract. The curbs, imposed in 2020 after a clash between the countries' troops, required Chinese bidders to register with an Indian government committee and obtain political and security clearances. Other capital goods stocks like Hitachi Energy, ABB India fell 4-4.5%. Shares of blue chip firm L&T fell nearly 3%. The measures effectively barred Chinese firms from competing for Indian government contracts that were estimated to be worth $700 billion to $750 billion. ""Officials are working to remove the registration requirement for bidders from bordering nations,"" one government source told Reuters, declining to be named as they were not authorised to speak publicly. The Ministry of Finance's plan to ease curbs followed requests from other government departments that are facing shortages and project delays due to the 2020 restrictions. ""Several ministries have requested exemptions to overcome the constraints that could derail projects in their sectors,"" a second government source told Reuters. Curbs on imports from China of equipment for the power sector have hindered India's plans to raise its thermal power capacity to about 307 GW over the next decade. A high-level committee headed by a former cabinet secretary, Rajiv Gauba, has also recommended easing the restrictions. Gauba is now a member of a top government think tank.

The shares of the electronics major fell to Rs 1,393.20 apiece, the lowest level seen by the stock since listing. LG Electronics' three-month lock-in period expires: Around 1.52 crore shares, or approximately 2 percent of the company's outstanding equity, have become eligible for trading after the expiry of the lock-in period, CNBC-TV18 quoted Nuvama Alternative and Quantitative Research as saying. The said number of shares will be cumulatively worth around Rs 2,214 crore based on the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 1,456.40 per share. However, this does not imply that all these shares will be offloaded in the market immediately. The expiry of the lock-in period simply means that these shares can now be traded. LG Electronics bumper market debut: The stock had made a strong market debut on December 10, listing at Rs 1,710.10 apiece on NSE. This marked a premium of 50 percent from the IPO price of Rs 1,140 per share. This came after the Rs 11,607-crore IPO of the company was subscribed more than 54 times. The stock is currently around 18 percent lower than its listing price. What lies ahead? LG Electronics India is investable in the long term owing to sound fundamentals, said Nitant Darekar Research Analyst at Bonanza. The company is a prominent player in the market for products, like washing machines in which it has 33.4 percent of the market share and in refrigerators it has 29.9 percent of the market share. ""The Rs 5,000 crore Sri City investment over 4-5 years signals conviction in capacity expansion and export optionality under the Global South strategy. While Q2 FY26 EBITDA margins compressed to 8.9% from 12.4% due to GST transition disruptions, commodity inflation, and promotional investments, management expects recovery through localization (targeting 70% from current 55.8%), premiumization, AMC recurring revenue, and B2B expansion,"" he explained. With the GST cut digested, healthy Rs 4,280 crore liquidity and strong brand momentum entering festive season, the long-term outlook supports sustained market share gains and margin normalization, though near-term volatility warrants patience, the analyst said. However, LG Electronics may see near-term volatility with the three-month lock-in period ending today, said Dr. Ravi Singh, Chief Research Officer at Master Capital Services. In Q2 FY26, the company reported a 27 percent YoY decline in net profit, despite a 1 percent increase in revenue. The analyst however explained that from a long-term market perspective, the outlook remains constructive. The stock’s strong IPO response and premium listing highlighted investor confidence in LG’s brand strength, market leadership, and India-focused strategy, he said. ""Because of premiumization, growing appliance penetration and export opportunities, management has consistently positioned India as an important growth market. Importantly, LG is gradually expanding beyond pure hardware by building non-hardware revenue streams such as subscriptions, digital platforms, and webOS-based services, which can structurally improve margins and earnings over time. Therefore, LG Electronics continues to be a strong long-term investment option supported by structural demand factors despite short-term volatility,"" Singh said.

Tata Consultancy Services led the decline, slipping as much as 3 percent, while Oracle Financial Services Software dropped up to 2 percent. Wipro and Tech Mahindra fell 2.14 percent and 2.07 percent, respectively. Coforge, Mphasis, LTIMindtree and Persistent Systems were also trading lower, declining up to 2 percent. Nine out of the 10 constituents of the Nifty IT index were in the red. The profit booking comes ahead of the start of the third quarter earnings season on January 12, when Tata Consultancy Services and HCLTech are scheduled to announce their results. Brokerages expect another muted quarter for Indian IT firms as weak demand in the United States and holiday-period client shutdowns continue to weigh on technology spending. On average, the top six IT firms by revenue are expected to report about 4 percent year-on-year revenue growth and a 5 percent rise in profit for the December quarter, compared with revenue growth of 6.5 percent in the September quarter, according to nine brokerages. Indian software exporters last reported double-digit revenue growth in the March quarter of 2023, when demand for digital transformation, cloud adoption and remote working surged in the post-pandemic period. The $283-billion Indian IT industry continues to face macroeconomic headwinds, including uncertainty over US tariffs, concerns over proposed visa fees and subdued client spending amid worries about economic growth in the United States. The US remains a key market for Indian IT firms, accounting for a significant share of their revenue. Sector bellwether Accenture recently beat Wall Street expectations on AI-led demand, but maintained its growth outlook, indicating a cautious near-term environment. Although India does not have pure-play AI companies, IT firms are shaping AI strategies through acquisitions and partnerships. Brokerages expect AI-related momentum to build over the next six months, with demand improving into 2026. Foreign investors pulled out a record USD 8.5 billion from IT stocks in 2025 due to tariff uncertainty, visa concerns and weak spending, accounting for nearly half of total foreign outflows from Indian equities. The Nifty IT index fell 12.6 percent in 2025, making it the worst-performing sector as Indian markets underperformed Asian and emerging market peers. Tata Consultancy Services is expected to report about 4.2 percent year-on-year revenue growth for the December quarter, slower than the 5.6 percent growth reported in the same period last year. Infosys and HCLTech are forecast to post revenue growth of about 8.1 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively, compared with 7.6 percent and 5.1 percent a year ago. Most brokerages do not expect HCLTech to revise its fiscal 2026 revenue growth guidance of 2–3 percent, or Infosys to raise its forecast of 3–5 percent.

The shares of these export-oriented stocks have seen significant volatility recently, since Trump took office and hiked tariffs on Indian imports to 50 percent, citing New Delhi's purchase of Russia oil. Textile and shrimp stocks: Gokaldas Exports shares crashed nearly 13 percent to trade at Rs 596.65 apiece. The stock later recovered some losses to close 8 percent lower in the red. Revenue from U.S. accounts for more 60 percent of the overall revenue for the company, whose shares fell more than 34 percent in 2025 amid Trump's tariff flipflops. K.P.R. Mill shares fell more than 4 percent. Pearl Global Industries shares meanwhile dropped around 8 percent. Apex Frozen Foods shares fell nearly 8 percent, while Avanti Feeds shares dropped nearly 9 percent. The shares of these export-oriented companies significantly declined as they derive a significant portion of their revenue from the American market. 500% US tariff on India? Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said that the bill would give US an added leverage over countries ""fueling Putin’s war machine"" by purchasing Russian oil. ""This bill would give President Trump tremendous leverage against countries like China, India, and Brazil to incentivise them to stop buying the cheap Russian oil that provides the financing for Putin's bloodbath against Ukraine,"" Aljazeera quoted Lindsey Graham, a senator for the US state of South Carolina as saying. He added that the legislation, cleared by Trump, could be taken up for a bipartisan vote as early as next week, as diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine continue. US Congress website shows that the proposed legislation, titled the Sanctioning of Russia Act 2025, would also impose penalties on individuals and entities, and sharply increase duties on all goods and services imported from Russia into US to a minimum of 500 percent, signalling a significant escalation in economic pressure. According to Graham, the bill would give the US president broader authority to penalise countries purchasing discounted Russian oil, which Washington argues is helping finance Moscow’s war in Ukraine. “This bill will allow President Trump to punish those countries that buy cheap Russian oil, fueling Putin’s war machine,” he said, naming China, India, and Brazil as potential targets. After a very productive meeting today with President Trump on a variety of issues, he greenlit the bipartisan Russia sanctions bill that I have been working on for months with Senator Blumenthal and many others. This will be well-timed, as Ukraine is making concessions for peace… — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 7, 2026 This comes as the much-awaited trade deal between India and US still remain elusive, despite several efforts and meetings between officials from both sides. ""I have a very good relationship with PM Modi, but he is not happy with me as India is paying high tariffs. But now they have reduced it very substantially, buying oil from Russia,"" Trump said recently. India has rejected claims that Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised to stop buying Russian oil, maintaining that its energy purchases are guided by national interest and energy security.

Sharp fall in metal prices, along with profit booking were among the key factors behind the sharp decline. The Nifty Metal index fell nearly 3 percent to a one-week low of 11,215 in the morning trading hours of Thursday, recording the worst single-day percentage drop since April 2025 Why are metal stocks declining? The sharp fall in the metal stocks may have been driven by profit booking in base metals. Copper, aluminium, gold and silver saw a massive surge recently, before beginning to decline as investors may have resorted to profit booking at elevated levels. Silver futures on MCX declined up to Rs 4,000 per kilogram, while gold, aluminium and copper futures fell around 1 percent each. “Precious metals faced profit-taking ahead of commodity index rebalancing,” said Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities. Citi said that based on combined Bloomberg Commodity Index and S&P GSCI data, along with its proprietary estimates for index assets under management, gold is likely to see outflows of about $6.8 billion, while silver could witness outflows of roughly $6.8 billion as well during the annual rebalancing exercise, CNBC-TV18 reported. Stocks in this sector were seeing profit-booking after a recent rally, Anshul Jain, technical analyst at Laxmi Shri Securities, said. Metal stocks: Hindustan Zinc shares were the top loser on the index, falling more than 5 percent as silver prices extended decline. National Aluminium Company (NALCO) tumbled around 5 percent. Jindal Stainless Steel, Jindal Steel & Power, Vedanta and Hindustan Copper shares fell around 4 percent each, while Hindalco Industries, NMDC, Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), JSW Steel and Tata Steel shares fell more than 2 percent each. Notably, Tata Steel on Wednesday said its India operations manufactured a record high quantity of crude steel in the December quarter, at 6.34 million tonnes, up over 11 percent from 5.69 million tonnes produced in the year-ago quarter. The production growth was attributed to higher output at Tata Steel's Jamshedpur and Kalinganagar factories. APL Apollo Tubes, Adani Enterprises and Welspun Corp shares fell more than 1 percent each. Prior to the decline in the current session and yesterday, the Nifty Metal index had risen for six consecutive days, during which it gained almost 5 percent. The index ended flat on Wednesday.

Silver ETFs also dropped, mirroring the fall in the precious and industrial metal. Hindustan Zinc shares dropped nearly 5 percent to a near three-week low of Rs 599.25 apiece, extending decline for the second consecutive session. The company is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity. Silver prices tumble: Silver futures with March expiry on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) fell more than Rs 3,000 to Rs 2,47,529 per kilogram. This comes after the contracts hit fresh lifetime high of Rs 2,59,692 per kg earlier yesterday. Futures with May expiry fell more than Rs 3,300 to Rs 2,54,876 per kilogram. The future contracts with July expiry meanwhile fell over Rs 4,000 to Rs 2,62,399 per kilogram. The sharp fall may have been driven by profit booking, while a stronger dollar weighed on sentiment across precious metals ahead of key U.S. jobs data due this week. Silver ETFs: Silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) mirrored the fall in silver prices. Edelweiss Silver ETF, HDFC Silver ETF, UTI Silver ETF, Axis Silver ETF, Zerodha Silver ETF, Groww Silver ETF, Tata Silver ETF, SBI Silver ETF, DSP Silver ETF, Aditya Birla Silver ETF, Mirae Asset Silver ETF, Nippon Silver ETF and ICICI Prudential Silver ETF were down more than 3 percent each.

Hindustan Zinc share price: Hindustan Zinc shares fell more than 3 percent in the past five days, but gained 22 percent in the past one month. The stock jumped 37 percent in the past six months. What should investors do? Silver shows higher volatility than gold showing a bubble-like behavior, Aggarwal from VSRK Capital said. ""Strategy entry can be planned when prices stabilise near support zones with market sentiment improving but consider that metals tend to remain choppy for years after a strong rally,"" he added. Looking ahead to 2026, the medium-term outlook remains constructive, especially for silver, Harshal Dasani, Business Head, INVasset PMS said, adding that the structural industrial demand linked to electronics, solar and electrification remains strong, while supply constraints have persisted for several years, keeping the market in deficit. ""Silver, in particular, had become a momentum trade in 2025, rising sharply over the year, which made it vulnerable to profit-booking and leveraged unwinds once sentiment turned. Gold, too, delivered outsized gains over the past year, so even routine corrections appear severe when they follow such a strong run,"" Dasani said. In the near term, price direction will continue to be influenced by the US dollar and real interest rates—any repricing toward higher yields tends to pressure non-yielding assets like gold and silver, while softer yields and risk aversion restore their appeal, according to the analyst.

The stock has now fallen more than 35 percent from its December high of Rs 254.40 apiece, wiping off more than Rs 40,000 crore from the newly-listed company’s market capitalization. In an exchange filing, Meesho announced that Megha Agarwal, General Manager – Business and a Senior Management Personnel of Meesho, on January 7 has tendered her resignation. Subsequently, Milan Partani, General Manager - User Growth and Content Commerce and Senior Management Personnel, will assume the role of General Manager – Commerce Platform. Lock-in expiry: Earlier yesterday, the stock hit the 5 percent lower circuit after the one-month shareholder lock-in period came to an end. Around 10.99 crore shares, or approximately 2 percent of the company's outstanding equity, have become eligible for trading after the expiry of the lock-in period, CNBC-TV18 quoted Nuvama Alternative and Quantitative Research as saying. The said number of shares will be cumulatively worth around Rs 2,002.82 crore based on the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 182.24 per share. However, this does not imply that all these shares will be offloaded in the market immediately. The expiry of the lock-in period simply means that these shares can now be traded. Meesho's bumper market debut: The stock had made a strong market debut on December 10, listing at Rs 162.50 apiece on NSE. This marked a premium of more than 46 percent from the IPO price of Rs 111 per share. This came after the Rs 5,421-crore IPO of the e-commerce platform was subscribed 79 times. The stock is currently around 32 percent higher than its listing price. How have Meesho shares performed since listing? After listing, the stock sharply jumped 65 percent to hit a high of Rs 254.40 apiece on December 18, before losing steam. The stock has so far declined 35 percent since then, and is nearing its listing price. What lies ahead? Meesho has significantly improved its logistics efficiency over the last few years, said Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza, who noted that the e-commerce platform's cost per order reduced from Rs 55 in FY23 to Rs 46 in FY25. ""This improvement came from building its own logistics platform called Valmo and improving delivery density. At the same time, cash on delivery orders have reduced from more than 90% earlier to about 61% in the first half of FY 2026, which further helps reduce delivery failures and costs. Valmo has also increased delivery reliability in smaller towns, which supported the reduction of failed and repeat deliveries. By improving logistics without heavy subsidies, Valmo lowered operating risk and strengthened cash flows, making the business more capital efficient and closer to profitability,"" he said. Despite these operational improvements, the stock has been under pressure recently. The key reason today is the expiry of the IPO lock in period, which has increased the supply of shares in the market and led to selling by early investors and pre-IPO shareholders. ""In addition, the stock had been trading at elevated valuation multiples compared to other consumer internet and retail peers, prompting profit taking. This lock in related supply, combined with broader risk off sentiment toward high valuation new age stocks, has resulted in valuation de rating, even as the underlying business performance remains largely intact,"" Tiwari said.

About 1,465 shares advanced compared to 1,402 declining shares on the NSE. The market is likely to consolidate further with a negative bias. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Nilesh Jain, Head – Technical and Derivatives Research Analyst (Equity Research) at Centrum Broking Varun Beverages | CMP: Rs 509.7 Varun Beverages has recently witnessed a breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart and has also moved above its 200-DMA, placed near Rs 485, which is now expected to act as immediate support. The breakout is supported by higher-than-average volumes, reinforcing the bullish outlook. Additionally, the stock is trading comfortably above both its short-term and long-term moving averages, indicating strong underlying momentum. From a derivatives perspective, the build-up of fresh long positions further strengthens the positive bias. Considering the overall technical setup, the stock appears well-positioned to move towards the Rs 555 level in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 555 Stop-Loss: Rs 485 Kalyan Jewellers India | CMP: 520.75 Kalyan Jewellers is forming a strong base and has recently witnessed a breakout from a multi-month falling trendline. The sharp price up-move is backed by significantly higher volumes, which validates the bullish setup. Additionally, the stock has reclaimed its long-term 200-DMA, placed around Rs 518, further strengthening the positive structure. Momentum indicators are also supportive, with the RSI moving above the 60 mark and the MACD generating a bullish crossover, indicating improving upward momentum. Overall, the technical structure suggests the stock is well-placed to move towards the Rs 580 level in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 580 Stop-Loss: Rs 490 Jio Financial Services | CMP: Rs 303.5 Jio Financial Services has formed a strong base after taking support at its 200-DMA, currently placed near the Rs 295 level. It has also formed a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern on the daily chart, signalling a potential bullish reversal. The recent price action is supported by higher-than-average volumes, which further strengthens the positive outlook. Additionally, a fresh bullish crossover on the MACD indicates improving momentum. On the downside, immediate support from the rising trendline is placed around the Rs 290 level. With these technical factors in place, the stock appears well-positioned to break out of the triangle pattern and move towards the Rs 330 level in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 330 Stop-Loss: Rs 290 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities Persistent Systems | CMP: Rs 6,513.5 Persistent Systems has formed a strong bullish candle on the daily chart, highlighting a resurgence in buying momentum. The 50-day EMA continues to act as a reliable dynamic support, with the stock repeatedly testing and holding this zone since December. The Persistent/Nifty IT ratio chart has delivered a consolidation breakout, indicating potential outperformance versus its sector. Momentum indicators remain supportive, with the RSI settling slightly above 60 and DI+ crossing above DI– on the ADX. With prices approaching a key resistance zone, the overall setup suggests a breakout could be imminent. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 6,520–6,470 with a stop-loss of Rs 6,290. On the upside, it is likely to test the Rs 6,970 level in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,970 Stop-Loss: Rs 6,290 Manappuram Finance | CMP: Rs 319.9 Following a decisive breakout above its downward-sloping trendline on December 19, Manappuram Finance witnessed a strong follow-through rally over the next three sessions. The stock then consolidated in a tight Rs 319–305 range and formed a Bullish Flag pattern. On Wednesday, the stock delivered a flag breakout, reflecting renewed buying interest. A rising ADX signals strengthening bullish momentum, while prices remain comfortably above key moving averages. Given the constructive consolidation and improving momentum, the stock appears well-placed to extend its ongoing up-move in the near term. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 320–317 with a stop-loss of Rs 308. On the upside, it is likely to test the Rs 340 level in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 340 Stop-Loss: Rs 308 Birlasoft | CMP: Rs 443.4 Birlasoft broke out of its downward-sloping trendline on December 2 and witnessed a strong follow-through move, rallying above its 200-day EMA and advancing towards the Rs 459 level. Subsequently, profit-booking pulled the stock back to the 200-day EMA, a key long-term trend indicator that often acts as a strong demand zone. A sharp rebound on Wednesday, with the stock closing over 5.25 percent higher, signals fresh buying interest. The DI+ crossover above DI– on the ADX reflects strengthening bullish momentum, while a close above the Bollinger Band midline further reinforces the positive near-term outlook. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 445–440 with a stop-loss of Rs 430. On the upside, it is likely to test the Rs 475 level in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 475 Stop-Loss: Rs Rs 430 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities BSE | CMP: Rs 2,744.9 BSE has broken out of a downward consolidation on the daily chart, signalling a shift in momentum. The price continues to hold above the 21 EMA, and both the 21 EMA and 50 EMA are in a bullish crossover. Additionally, the RSI is in a bullish crossover and trending higher. In the short term, the stock may continue to remain strong, with upside potential towards Rs 2,900. Support is placed at Rs 2,684, below which a correction cannot be ruled out.

The decline has been accompanied by healthy volumes, indicating active selling pressure. The RSI has also broken down from consolidation, reinforcing the bearish view.

On the lower end, it found support at the 21 EMA before closing higher. In the near term, the trend is likely to remain sluggish, with the range placed between 26000 and 26300. Any decisive fall below 26000 may trigger further weakness. On the other hand, a decisive move above 26300 would require for a directional upmove in the Nifty. Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities Nifty began the session on a weak note and attempted a recovery but faced strong resistance twice near the 26,180–26,190 zone, leading to a gradual decline. The index staged a steady recovery in the second half from the day’s low of 26,069 but eventually ended the day 0.14% lower at 26,140. Since hitting an all-time high of 26,373 on 5th January, Nifty has posted consecutive doji candles on the daily chart. However, despite intraday choppiness, Index managed to close above its 20-day EMA, indicating underlying support remains intact. Going ahead, for Nifty, the 50-day EMA zone of 25,950-25,900 will act as an immediate support. Any sustained move below the 25,900 level could lead to Index extending its weakness further down towards the 25,800 level, followed by 25,700.

"2026 will see improvement in earnings growth; IT, consumption, materials are 'dark horses':  ABSL AMC's Harish Krishnan",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/2026-will-see-improvement-in-earnings-growth-it-consumption-materials-are-dark-horses-absl-amc-s-harish-krishnan-13761305.html,"Indian equity markets are entering a phase of “reboot, refresh and reclaim”, with opportunities shifting decisively from crowded themes to selective, company-specific bets, said Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC co-CIO and head of equities Harish Krishnan. He also cautioned against over-owned small caps and pointed to an earnings-led cycle beginning in 2026. Speaking at the fund house’s annual market outlook presentation, Krishnan said the easy gains of the post-pandemic rally are behind the market. “In 2023 and 2024, it was a rising tide that lifted all boats. Luck was getting rewarded, and many people thought it was skill,” he said. Large Caps in focus: Krishnan also noted that while the profit pool share of India’s top 100 companies has returned close to long-term highs, ownership has shifted aggressively toward mid- and small-cap stocks. “Close to 30–35% of mutual fund houses today have higher exposure to mid and small caps than to large caps,” he said. “There has been a significant amount of money chasing small caps over the last three to four years. That bus does look overcrowded,"" he added. While earnings may continue to grow in smaller companies, he warned that elevated ownership and stretched valuations limit upside. “That is why we continue to believe there is far greater opportunity in the larger companies than going small and micro,” Krishnan said. He added that opportunities are becoming selective rather than broad-based. “Good companies are scarce today compared to the previous cycle, which is why valuations have got mainstreamed. Opportunities are not everywhere, but there are pockets where one can still make reasonably good money.” Earnings Recovery: On earnings, Krishnan said 2025 has been a difficult year marked by single-digit growth, but conditions are in place for improvement. “We do think CY26 will be better than CY25,” he said, clarifying that the key driver will be an acceleration in earnings rather than mere upgrades. He pointed to three tailwinds: monetary easing, fiscal support to consumers, and currency trends. Krishnan highlighted that nearly 55–60% of India’s corporate revenue pool is dollar-linked. “Think about IT services, pharma, auto ancillaries, metals, energy. These are very large revenue pools,” he said adding that a rupee depreciation actually lifts the revenue base for a lot of companies. However, he cautioned that foreign investors only turn constructive once the currency stabilises. “It is not the slide in the rupee that helps; it is when the rupee stops sliding that earnings start reflecting in a meaningful way,” he said. IPO Supply: Krishnan flagged the surge in equity supply as a key factor capping market returns. “If you include IPOs, OFS, QIPs, promoter sales and private equity exits, supply is annualising at close to 2% of market capitalisation,” he said. These numbers, he noted are very difficult for the market to digest. He added that IPO performance has deteriorated even as issuance volumes surged. “The weighted average return of IPOs has been coming down,” Krishnan said, noting that Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC has significantly reduced participation in new listings. “In the last 12 months, our IPO participation rate is about 22%. That means we have invested in roughly one out of every five IPOs,” he said. “Where there has been too much froth, we have consciously stayed away,"" he added. Sector View: IT, Consumption, Materials as ‘Dark Horses’ Using the fund house’s proprietary sector framework, Krishnan identified IT, consumption, and materials as “dark horse” segments where pessimism and low ownership could create alpha. “IT is one such space where everyone believes AI will dismantle the industry,” he said. “We agree the threat is real, but a lot of that fear is already priced in.” Consumption is another area where the firm is turning constructive after being underweight for nearly three years. “We are now moving into consumption as a theme,” Krishnan said, pointing to fiscal measures, tax cuts, and potential pay commission effects. Materials, including chemicals, building materials and consumer durables, form the third opportunity bucket. On the other hand, Krishnan said the fund house has been booking profits or staying underweight in industrials, capital goods, real estate and PSU-linked financials. “Capital goods was a space where we made a lot of money in 2023 and 2024. In the second half of 2025, we moved out,” he said.

DIL has been able to negotiate a favorable agreement with Yum!, in terms of significant cost waivers in PH, phased transition of key business functions like tech/supplychain management (SCM) for PH/KFC, and additional marketing/innovation rights for PH. Some of these new functions, though, will require new tech/team capabilities; DIL has already started investing in leadership gaps and shortlisted a global tech partner. Encouragingly, the expected synergy benefits of Rs2.10-2.25bn are net of these investments; 60% of the savings should likely accrue in FY28E itself, with the complete benefit expected in FY29E. With relaxed store targets in the new agreement along with cost waivers, DIL expects revival of the PH brand and return of double-digit brand contribution for the format (vs largely having achieved breakeven currently).

"HDFC Bank large trade: Rs 1,756 crore equity stake changes hands; stock falls 1.5%, extends losing streak",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hdfc-bank-large-trade-rs-1-756-crore-equity-stake-changes-hands-stock-falls-1-5-extends-losing-streak-13761053.html,"HDFC Bank shares extended their recent decline on Wednesday after a about 0.1 percent of the bank's equity stake was sold for a transaction value of Rs 1,756 crore in a large trade. As many as 1.84 crore shares of HDFC Bank changed hands at an average price of around Rs 950 per share. The stock was trading at Rs 948.35, down 1.44 percent in intraday trade, adding to sharp losses over the past two sessions. HDFC Bank shares had fallen 1.6 percent on Tuesday and 2.4 percent on Monday, taking the cumulative price decline over the last two days to nearly 3.9 percent, before today’s fall. The recent weakness in the stock follows the lender’s Q3 FY26 business update, after which HDFC Bank emerged as one of the top drags on the benchmark indices. The stock slipped to its lowest level in more than three months earlier this week, reflecting investor caution despite steady headline growth numbers. Also read | TPG said to be in talks with IIFL Capital for stake acquisition In its provisional update, HDFC Bank reported a 9 percent year-on-year rise in average advances under management to Rs 28.64 lakh crore in the December quarter, compared with Rs 26.28 lakh crore a year ago. Period-end advances under management rose 9.8 percent year-on-year to Rs 29.46 lakh crore, while gross advances grew 11.9 percent year-on-year to Rs 25.43 lakh crore. However, brokerages flagged concerns around the pace of deposit accretion. While Motilal Oswal Financial Services retained a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock, citing healthy momentum in advances growth, analysts at Nomura pointed to slower deposit growth, noting that the credit-deposit ratio climbed close to 100 percent during the quarter. According to Nomura, stronger deposit inflows would be required for HDFC Bank to meaningfully accelerate loan growth in coming quarters. Despite the recent correction, HDFC Bank’s stock is up about 10.7 percent over the past year, marginally outperforming the Nifty 50. The bank’s market capitalisation currently stands at around Rs 14.58 lakh crore.

The shares of the company dropped to a near two-month low of Rs 703.30 apiece in the morning trading hours of Wednesday. Morgan Stanley on IHCL: Morgan Stanley has downgraded the shares of IHCL to 'equal-weight' from its earlier 'overweight' rating, and cut its target price to Rs 780 per share from Rs 811 apiece. The latest target price implies a upside potential of more than 7 percent from the stock's previous closing price of Rs 726.40 apiece. By leveraging the Taj brand, IHCL has created a hospitality ecosystem that delivers industry-leading return ratios and free cash flow, CNBC-TV18 quoted Morgan Stanley as saying. It added that while the industry revenue per available room cycle is strong, it may see limited upside surprises. The brokerage sees domestic hotel RevPAR growth of 9-10 percent in Q3 FY26; EBITDA up approximately 10 percent YOY. However, it cut FY26-28 EPS outlook by 2-3 percent due to slightly lower RevPAR estimates and margins. The international brokerage added that the enterprise value (EV)/earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 27.5x for FY27, properly captures the risk-reward. IHCL Q2 Results: The Indian Hotels Company (IHCL) on November 4 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 285 crore for the July-September quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a 49 percent YoY decrease from the Rs 554.58 crore net profit reported in the same period last year, including a one-time gain.

The shares of the ecommerce platform fell to Rs 173.13 apiece, extending losses for the second consecutive session to trade near its listing price of Rs 162.50 apiece. Meesho's one-month lock-in period expires: Around 10.99 crore shares, or approximately 2 percent of the company's outstanding equity, have become eligible for trading after the expiry of the lock-in period, CNBC-TV18 quoted Nuvama Alternative and Quantitative Research as saying. The said number of shares will be cumulatively worth around Rs 2,002.82 crore based on the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 182.24 per share. However, this does not imply that all these shares will be offloaded in the market immediately. The expiry of the lock-in period simply means that these shares can now be traded. Meesho's bumper market debut: The stock had made a strong market debut on December 10, listing at Rs 162.50 apiece on NSE. This marked a premium of more than 46 percent from the IPO price of Rs 111 per share. This came after the Rs 5,421-crore IPO of the e-commerce platform was subscribed 79 times. The stock is currently around 32 percent higher than its listing price. How have Meesho shares performed since listing? After listing, the stock sharply jumped 65 percent to hit a high of Rs 254.40 apiece on December 18, before losing steam. The stock has so far declined 32 percent since then, and is nearing its listing price. The company currently has a market capitalization of Rs 78,136 crore. What lies ahead? Meesho has significantly improved its logistics efficiency over the last few years, said Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza, who noted that the e-commerce platform's cost per order reduced from Rs 55 in FY23 to Rs 46 in FY25. ""This improvement came from building its own logistics platform called Valmo and improving delivery density. At the same time, cash on delivery orders have reduced from more than 90% earlier to about 61% in the first half of FY 2026, which further helps reduce delivery failures and costs. Valmo has also increased delivery reliability in smaller towns, which supported the reduction of failed and repeat deliveries. By improving logistics without heavy subsidies, Valmo lowered operating risk and strengthened cash flows, making the business more capital efficient and closer to profitability,"" he said. Despite these operational improvements, the stock has been under pressure recently. The key reason today is the expiry of the IPO lock in period, which has increased the supply of shares in the market and led to selling by early investors and pre-IPO shareholders. ""In addition, the stock had been trading at elevated valuation multiples compared to other consumer internet and retail peers, prompting profit taking. This lock in related supply, combined with broader risk off sentiment toward high valuation new age stocks, has resulted in valuation de rating, even as the underlying business performance remains largely intact,"" Tiwari said.

Senco Gold shares rallied 14 percent to Rs 368.4 apiece, while Kalyan Jewellers India shares jumped 7 percent to Rs 535 apiece. Senco Gold Q3 update: Senco Gold released its Q3 business update in the post market hours of January 6. The company recorded a 51 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in the October-December quarter of the ongoing FY26. This takes the total growth to 31 percent in the first nine months of FY26 (April-December), after 6.5 percent growth in Q2 and 28 percent in Q1. “Our TTM revenue has already reached ~₹8000 crore, reflecting consistent YoY growth, loyal customer base and brand positioning. The Q3 YoY growth includes retail business growth of ~49% and SSSG of ~39% growth. The 9-month topline growth of 31% includes SSSG of ~21% growth. This uplift was led by targeted festive campaigns, new design launches and intensive customer engagement during Dhanteras & Diwali, wedding buying and shift of demand of Q2 to the festive season. Diamond jewellery sales continued to maintain strong growth momentum in Q3 to ~36% YoY growth and 9-month growth of ~34%,” the firm said. During the quarter under review, Senco Gold launched 4 new franchise showrooms, taking the total showroom network to 196 (inclusive of 8 Sennes and 2 international showrooms). “We have successfully navigated the peak festive demand of Q3 and continue to optimise our inventory more towards a Lightweight and budget-friendly product range due to rising gold prices. We are prepared for the upcoming Q4 wedding season, Valentine's Day and International Women's Day, and other local festivals and targeting growth in the studded category through curated collections with 18%~20% growth,” it added. The company said that it is on course to achieve its annual target of 20 new showroom openings for FY26, and expects another 3 to 4 showrooms under the COCO and FOCO models to achieve the milestone of 200 showrooms and have a robust pipeline for H1 next year.

The firm’s India operations witnessed revenue growth of nearly 42 percent during Q3 FY26 as against Q3 FY25, driven primarily by strong festive demand. “Demand during the period after Diwali also continued to remain robust despite volatility in gold prices. Growth was broad-based across plain gold and studded categories. The quarter recorded healthy same-store-sales-growth of approximately 27%,” the company said. Kalyan's international operations recorded revenue growth of approximately 36 percent for the recently concluded quarter when compared to the same period during the previous financial year. “Within the Middle East specifically, we witnessed revenue growth of approximately 28% for Q3 FY2026 as compared to Q3 FY2025 driven majorly by same-store-sales-growth. International markets contributed approximately 11% to our consolidated revenue for the recently concluded quarter,” the firm added. Spot gold prices rose nearly 12 percent during the quarter, to close out a calendar year in which the precious metal clocked its steepest rise since 1979, driven by geopolitical uncertainties, rate cuts and robust central bank buying. ""Higher prices did have an impact on volumes, but not on (overall) spending,"" said Dharmesh Kant, head of equity research at Cholamandalam Securities. Kant added that jewellery companies also benefitted from higher cash in the hands of people as a result of fiscal policies like GST cuts and income tax relief, as well as low inflation.
