At close, the Sensex was up 1,089.18 points or 1.49 percent at 74,227.08, and the Nifty was up 374.25 points or 1.69 percent at 22,535.85. Nifty Auto, IT, Metal, Realty too snapped a three-day losing streak to rise between 1.2-2.5 percent. The BSE Midcap index rose 1.8 percent and Smallcap index added 2 percent. The gains on April 9 have resulted in investors' wealth rise by more than Rs 7 lakh crore, as the market capitalization of BSE-listed companies jumped to Rs 396 lakh crore, from Rs 390 lakh crore in the previous session. Overnight, the US stocks had ended lower on signs of the tariff spat escalating, after the European Union proposed counter-tariffs, while Trump threatened to add another 50% duty on US imports from China on Wednesday, if it did not withdraw its 34% retaliatory tariffs. Despite a weak handover from US, Asia bounced back to snap the slump sparked by concerns over President Trump’s tariff war. Going forward, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will most likely opt for a rate cut in its latest policy review on April 9. The liquidity situation in the banking system has improved, supporting growth, which may be facing downward risk due to the tariff impact, economists have said. Also Read: We could already be seeing a Trump bottom, says Prashant Khemka Among key stocks, Jio Financial, Shriram Finance, Titan Company, Cipla, Bharat Electronics were the major gainers on the Nifty, while only loser was Power Grid. All the sectoral indices ended in the green with Capital Goods, Consumer Durables, FMCG, Oil and Gas, PSU, Realty, Telecom, Media up 2-4 percent. Outlook for April 9 Aditya Gaggar Director of Progressive Shares The combination of oversold condition and a strong recovery in global equities helped the Index begin the session on a positive note. Despite a short dip during the opening trade, Nifty50 managed to extend its gains, finishing the day higher at 22,535.85 with gains of 374.25 points. All sectors closed in the green, with Media and PSU Banks leading the way. With gains of over 2%, Mid and Small-cap stocks outperformed the Frontline Index. The Spinning Top candlestick pattern observed on the daily chart suggests indecisiveness between the bulls and bears. Under normal circumstances, the day’s high and low (22,700 and 22,270, respectively) would serve as immediate resistance and support levels. A breakout above or below these levels would signal a clear trend direction. Vaibhav Vidwani, Research Analyst at Bonanza Today, the Indian stock market rebounded strongly with the Sensex surging over 1,000 points to close at 74,227, and the Nifty 50 ending above 22,500. This recovery was driven by several factors, including positive global cues as Asian markets showed resilience and some easing of trade war fears as investors began to believe that the US-China trade tensions might not significantly impact other major economies. Hopes of a possible RBI rate cut to address liquidity challenges contributed to the upside. The market's fear gauge, India VIX, dropped significantly, indicating reduced investor anxiety. Market expectations remain cautiously optimistic, with investors awaiting clarity on global trade developments and the RBI's policy stance. Despite ongoing uncertainty, the stable macroeconomic fundamentals of India and fair valuations in large-cap stocks are expected to support the market in the long term. Overall, the market's ability to bounce back from significant losses suggests a robust underlying sentiment, though investors are likely to remain in a wait-and-watch mode until more clarity emerges on global trade tensions.

The rebound follows the sharp sell-off on April 7 that wiped out Rs 16 lakh crore in market capitalisation. All 13 sectoral indices rose around 2 percent, reflecting broad-based buying. At close, the Sensex was up 1,089.18 points or 1.49 percent at 74,227.08, and the Nifty was up 374.25 points or 1.69 percent at 22,535.85.

Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates India’s volatility index, India VIX—often referred to as the ""fear gauge""—also cooled down significantly, dropping by over 10 percent to hover around the 20 mark. This came after a dramatic spike the previous day when the index surged by as much as 66 percent to hit a five-year high. Investors may continue in wait-and-watch mode since it will take time for clarity to emerge. ""However, since India’s macros are stable and we can grow at around 6 percent in FY26 and the valuations are fair, particularly in large caps, long-term investors can start nibbling at high-quality large caps like the leading financials. Since Trump is unlikely to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals at this stage, pharma stocks, which are attractively priced now, appear to be good buys,"" said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments. Also read: We could already be seeing a Trump bottom, says Prashant Khemka ""The primary reason behind the recent selloff is the fear of a full-blown global trade war and its potential to tip the world economy into a recession. Countries including China, Canada, and the European Union have spoken about retaliatory tariffs on American goods, and the uncertainty around whether a settlement can be reached before the next phase of tariff hikes is causing widespread nervousness,"" Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Research and Wealth Management at Motilal Oswal said in a conversation with Moneycontrol. All sectoral indices traded in the green, with the battered Nifty IT index leading the rebound after suffering an 8 percent decline over the past five sessions. Tech majors such as TCS, Infosys, HCL Tech, and Wipro rose as much as 4 percent in the afternoon session, as the sector prepares to kick off its March-quarter earnings season in two days.

Despite the rebound, several market experts advised investors to maintain a cautious stance in the short term, citing continued uncertainty stemming from tariff-related tensions. Chetan Ahya, Chief Asia Economist at Morgan Stanley, remarked that India is unlikely to remain immune to the global slowdown triggered by escalating tariff wars. Speaking to CNBC-TV18, he stated, ""India could face a 40 to 50 basis point downside in GDP growth as a consequence of ongoing tariff tensions."" Shares of oil marketing companies (OMCs) such as Hindustan Petroleum Corp., Bharat Petroleum Corp., and Indian Oil Corp. surged in trade, lifted by the government's decision to raise the price of household LPG and the special excise duty on petrol and diesel. Oil companies are expected to recover around Rs 9,000 crore in FY26 through the Rs 50 hike in domestic LPG prices which will offset the ongoing losses, according to sources. Shares of Info Edge, the parent company of job search platform Naukri.com, surged nearly 5 percent on April 8 after the company reported a 19 percent rise in standalone billings during the January-March quarter of financial year 2025.

The Cupertino-based tech major is looking to implement the plan as a temporary measure to offset the high cost of imports due to the tariffs imposed on Beijing, the American daily Wall Street Journal reported. ""From a technical standpoint, the current market conditions appear quite troubling, as evidenced by the VIX spiking over 65 percent in just one day.

4,"Traders turn cautious as Trump tariff fears rattle Indian equities; options market reveals expectations of wild swings, low faith in upside break-out",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/traders-turn-cautious-as-trump-tariff-fears-rattle-indian-equities-12987871.html,"In the days following the Trump administration’s tariff announcements on April 2, the Indian derivatives market has mirrored the uncertainty that has gripped investors worldwide. With global volatility spiking and institutional flows turning cautious, traders have swiftly recalibrated their strategies—shifting towards safety, hedging aggressively, and betting on sharp swings instead of steady trends. Market participants say the current phase is far from business as usual. ""This uncertainty is going to linger till we know how other countries respond and what kind of trade dynamics emerge globally,"" Rajesh Palviya, Head of Technical and Derivatives Research at Axis Securities said in a conversation with Moneycontrol. Also read: We could already be seeing a Trump bottom, says Prashant Khemka To be sure, in April so far, FIIs have sold nearly 22,700 crore worth of stocks in the cash market. According to NSDL data, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold significantly more index futures than they bought since the start of April. They bought 93,958 contracts worth Rs 15,350 crore, but sold 1,50,025 contracts valued at Rs 24,921 crore. This reflects a bearish undertone indicating that while trading activity was high, FIIs could be positioning on the short side, possibly anticipating further market volatility or downside in the near term. Palviya attributes the recent sell-off to a mix of fear, global quantitative tightening, and weak macroeconomic signals. ""Everyone exited their positions because they didn’t know where this was heading,"" he says. ""India VIX, our volatility gauge, has surged over 60 percent, breaking out of a six-month range. Swings of 2 to 3 percent are now becoming the new normal."" The India VIX spiked nearly 66 percent yesterday to hit multi-month highs around the 23 mark. While there has been some cooling off today, Mishra points out that the index remains at elevated levels, reflecting a cautious market sentiment and the likelihood of sharp moves ahead. Read more: Macquarie's India playbook: 6 stars, 6 hitters, and 6 rising stocks Supporting this sentiment, Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President at Religare Broking, says that the derivatives landscape is revealing more than just tactical moves—it's flashing a strong risk-off signal. ""FIIs had shown some buying interest in March, but post the tariff shock, they’ve gone back to selling,"" he notes. Mishra points to the sharp fall in net long positions, suggesting that institutional players are no longer willing to ride out the storm. On the derivatives front, the long-short ratio of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) has dropped to 25 percent, indicating that 75 percent of their positions are now on the short side. This marks a sharp decline from the nearly 40 percent level seen at the end of the March series expiry. Interestingly, foreign investors are increasingly using index options instead of taking directional bets through index futures—a sign of elevated caution. ""It’s a way to hedge without being fully exposed,"" says Palviya. The activity is reflected in the open interest build-up. Deep out-of-the-money puts around the 21,000 level and heavy call writing at 22,300–22,500 suggest that traders are bracing for wide price swings. The Bank Nifty also portrays a complex picture. While the index held above long-term averages, it still faced supply pressure. Palviya believes the upcoming RBI monetary policy has only added to the uncertainty. ""The heavy buying in Bank Nifty options despite selling in futures indicates hedge-based strategies in play. A lot hinges on what the RBI announces,"" he adds. On the options front, Mishra observes a mixed picture. While the 22,000 strike has some support on the put side, aggressive call writing at 23,000 and above shows limited belief in an upside breakout. “There’s clear resistance in the 22,500–22,700 zone. Unless Nifty breaches that, we’ll likely stay range-bound or drift lower,” he adds. In terms of trading strategy, both experts advise restraint. ""Don’t try to catch a falling knife,"" warns Palviya. ""The volatility we’re seeing—4 to 5 percent intraday swings—makes most indicators unreliable. It’s all about risk management now."" Mishra echoes the sentiment, recommending hedged strategies like bear spreads near resistance zones or protective puts for investors holding long positions. Dalal Street went into a freefall on April 7, as panic-selling took the benchmark indices sharply lower. Triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff tantrum on Wall Street, a wave of global jitters wiped out a jaw-dropping Rs 16 lakh crore in market value — the sharpest intraday collapse since June 2024. Inflation fears, a looming consumption crunch, and recession fears had investors running for cover as the Nifty and Sensex plunged deep into the red.

For Suven Pharma, Goldman has given a target price of Rs 1,350 per share, predicting a sharp rebound from FY26. According to the brokerage, the recovery will be led by Suven's top-performing drugs and potential new drug approvals in the pipeline.

The brokerage has initiated coverage with a ‘Buy’ rating and a target price of Rs 275 per share, underlining that the company is well-positioned for top-quartile profit growth. Goldman projects that Piramal's Profit Before Tax (PBT) margin will improve sharply, rising from around 3 percent in FY24 to over 16 percent by FY28. This margin expansion, the note says, will be driven by a combination of CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organisation) business growth, CHG (complex hospital generics) capacity expansion, and a turnaround in its ICH (inhalation and complex hospital) business. Both stocks are being seen as attractive long-term bets in the pharma space as the sector stabilises after a volatile few year.

The poll features responses from around 18 market experts across mutual funds, PMS, Family Offices and leading brokerages. Most experts polled believe that markets may be closer to a bottom, but clarity is yet to emerge with respect to the global impact of tariffs, but they remain largely sanguine about India-specific factors. “RBI and the government clearly have created tailwinds for discretionary spends to perk up. This could help the markets to get its mojo back. Given the correction, the Indian market valuations have become reasonable. Declining inflation, interest rates, improved liquidity conditions could place the markets in a good stead for the medium term,” said Shashank Khade, Co-Founder and Chief Equity Advisor, Entrust Family Office. One of the fund managers, Ankita Pathak, Chief Macro and Global Strategist at Ionic Wealth said it is important to look beyond US equities. She added that markets will be watching for triggers indicating a revival. “All eyes should be on central banks and earnings season ahead.” Here are the key highlights from the survey: 1. Half the experts unsure if markets have bottomedWhen asked whether markets have bottomed out, 50% of the respondents admitted they 'can’t say', highlighting the uncertainty in the global environment. Only 16.7% said the bottom is in place, while an equal number said that the markets haven’t bottomed yet. Another 16.7% respondents anticipated a potential 10% downside in 2025. 2. Cash remains in focusIn response to whether cash is still king, 38.9% of participants said they are holding more than 20% of their portfolio in cash. Close to 27.8% respondents said they are holding less than 5% in cash, and 22.2% said they are in the 5–10% range. Only 11.1% respondents said they are keeping 10–20% portfolio in cash. 3. Open to deploying more cash into stocksAround 83.3% of respondents indicated plans to deploy more cash into equities, suggesting a growing optimism or readiness to capitalise on market corrections. Only 5.6% said they wouldn’t be looking to add long-positions in this ongoing volatile phase, and 11.1% remained uncertain. 4. Nifty seen between 22,000 and 24,000 this yearOn where the Nifty level for the end of the year, 66.7% respondents said they expect it to settle in the 22,000–24,000 range, a slightly lower view than what was being factoted in earlier this year, yet the highest among survey options. Another 22.2% see a close between 20,000-22,000, while 11.1% respondents see levels between 18,000-20,000. None of the respondents expects the index to drop below 18,000. Out of the six respondents that hold more than 20 percent in cash, there were three mutual fund and four portfolio managers. 5. Consumption is top sectoral pickWhen it comes to sector preferences, FMCG and Consumer Discretionary emerged as the most favoured, each with 44.4% of the vote. Energy and Consumer Durables followed closely at 33.3%. IT, Capital Goods, and Banks each garnered 22.2%, while Metals and Oil & Gas trailed slightly.

News reports have suggested that China may be discussing frontloading stimulus to counter US tariff levy, with a Bloomberg News report dated April 7 saying that Beijing is preparing a plan to defend its economic interests amid heightened trade uncertainties. US President Trump had on April 2 introduced a slew of reciprocal tariffs on several nations, including 26 percent tariff on Indian imports, triggering an escalation in trade tensions, with countries threatening counter-measures. China said it will impose 34 percent tariff on US imports. Global equity markets had crashed on April 7, as investors worried over a possible US recession and the implications of a trade war, with Metal stocks among the worst hit, and Nifty Metal crashing nearly 7 percent. However, the latest report on China's stimulus package and the decline in the strength of the US dollar has likely helped stocks stage a recovery. Nifty Metal closed over 1.5 percent higher at 7,965.60. Lloyds Metals And Energy shares were the top gainer on the index, rising over 6 percent. JSW Steel and Adani Enterprises shares were up nearly 3 percent each. APL Apollo Tubes and Hindustan Copper shares also closed nearly 3 percent higher. National Aluminum, Hindalco, Jindal Steel & Power, Jindal Stainless Steel and other stocks recorded gains over 1 percent. Tata Steel shares closed in the green with marginal gains. This comes a day after the stock crashed 10 percent to briefly get locked in the lower circuit. Other metal stocks which were trading in the green with marginal gains included NMDC, Vedanta and Steel Authority of India (SAIL). Despite the positive momentum in the index, Welspun Corp shares closed nearly 3 percent lower at Rs 770 apiece. PL Capital's latest note said that it sees opportunities to invest after the recent fall in share prices. ""We believe the recent sharp fall in stocks makes valuations attractive and offers an opportunity to invest in companies having higher domestic exposure as domestic demand is expected to remain stable,"" the PL note said. ""...US tariffs and rationalization of Chinese steel capacities had led to increase in steel prices across regions. However, escalating trade tariffs have increased the risk of supply chain disruptions, high inflation, and slowdown of global economies which have affected commodity prices,"" PL Capital added. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services has said that the uncertainty and volatility may linger on for some more time. ""There are some significant takeaways from the ongoing chaos. One, the trade war is like to be confined to US and China. Others including EU and Japan have opted for negotiations. India has already started negotiations on a BTA with US. Two, the risk of a recession in the US has increased. Three, China is likely to be the worst-hit economy,"" said Vijayakumar. US President Trump’s threat of another 50 percent tariff on China, on top of the recently announced one threatens to 'freeze' Chinese exports to US. ""China will try to dump its products like metals in other countries, and this will keep international metal prices depressed,"" Vijayakumar added.

MATL is established under the manufacturing and allied services category and is set to concentrate on technologies related to security. The formal incorporation of the new entity was completed on April 7, 2025, in Mumbai, Maharashtra, following board approval which had been granted earlier on February 7, 2025. M&M has subscribed to 50 lakh equity shares of Rs 10 each at par value in this newly formed entity, resulting in complete ownership—100 percent stake—in MATL. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog During FY25, M&M recorded a significant rise in sales, reaching 5.13 million units, a notable increase from 4.27 million units sold in FY24. This exceptional growth in sales propelled M&M’s market share from 10.79 percent to 12.34 percent, placing the company within close range of overtaking Tata Motors to secure the third position in India’s highly competitive passenger vehicle (PV) market. Additionally, M&M’s market share in the electric vehicle (EV) segment also rose to 7.60 percent in FY25, compared to 6.69 percent in the previous year. In contrast, rival automakers experienced marginal to moderate declines in market share. Maruti Suzuki saw a slight dip in its market share from 40.60 percent to 40.25 percent. Hyundai Motor India recorded a sharper decline, with its market share falling from 14.21 percent to 13.46 percent. Tata Motors also experienced a contraction in market share, decreasing from 13.62 percent to 12.90 percent. According to UBS, M&M’s vehicle volumes are projected to grow by 9 percent in FY26, even as the broader automotive industry is expected to see a more modest expansion of just 2 percent. The brokerage attributes M&M’s projected outperformance to strong demand in the SUV segment, as well as a slate of upcoming EV launches. UBS further anticipates that M&M will roll out additional SUV models in FY26, further boosting its market presence. The brokerage also highlighted that M&M’s farm equipment division, which contributes 40 percent to the company’s earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) and accounts for 30 percent of the sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation, continues to perform well. This segment is reportedly facing no immediate challenges related to technology changes or regulatory hurdles.

In its fourth-quarter business update, Titan reported a 25 percent year-on-year increase in revenue across all its verticals. The company’s flagship jewellery segment witnessed a 25 percent growth compared to the same quarter last year. This was largely fueled by a significant uptick in gold prices. However, the rise in gold rates also had a dampening effect on demand in lower price brackets, resulting in only single-digit growth in the number of buyers. Stay tuned to our LIVE blog for all the real-time market developments Titan's eyecare segment recorded a 19 percent rise, supported by healthy contributions in both revenue and customer base. Meanwhile, the watches and wearables division reported a 22 percent increase in revenue. Other businesses under the Titan umbrella—which include fragrances and fashion accessories—grew by 26 percent year-on-year. This was primarily driven by a 12 percent increase in the fashion accessories category. On the flip side, sales of its ethnic wear brand Taneira dipped by 4 percent. During the quarter, the company launched the first experiential store for its fragrance brand 'SKINN' at Seawoods, Mumbai. Its premium handbag brand 'IRTH' expanded with four new store openings in Hyderabad, Pune, Noida, and Mumbai. Taneira, however, shut down one store in the same period. Titan’s digital-first jewellery brand Caratlane posted a 22 percent year-on-year growth, boosted by strong consumer interest in gold jewellery and a robust performance in its studded collection. The number of buyers grew in the mid-single digits, while like-to-like growth stood at 11 percent. During the quarter, Caratlane added 17 new domestic stores on a net basis. At present, around 35 brokerages are tracking Titan. Of these, 21 have issued a “buy” rating, 10 have recommended a “hold,” and 4 have suggested a “sell.” So far this year, shares of Titan have slipped by 7 percent. This decline is slightly steeper than the 6 percent fall registered by the benchmark Nifty 50 index over the same period.

Trading volume on Monday broke U.S. records for the second session in a row. In early trade, all three major U.S. indexes touched their lowest levels in more than a year.

In Monday morning trading, the S&P 500 had fallen 20% below its record closing high. The index briefly rallied more than 3%, after a news report said Trump was considering a 90-day pause on tariffs. White House officials quickly denied the report, sending the market back into the red. Meckler said the market's wild swings on Monday left investors ""a little bit concerned that if facts start to change, you could see a very rapid rise to this market."" ""It's leading to this back-and-forth movement of rallies that are effectively being sold and drops in the market where people are covering shorts or trying to find a place to buy.""

The market breadth was dismal, with a total of 2,448 shares trapped in a bear market, compared to just 193 shares that outperformed. The trend is expected to remain favourable for bears, but some rebound can't be ruled out, considering the significant fall in the past few days. Below are some trading ideas for the near term: Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Kotak Mahindra Bank | CMP: Rs 2,037.85 Kotak Mahindra Bank has been one of the outperformers in the Nifty private sector banks, and the uptrend has been largely due to short covering. The stock has provided a breakout from a range lasting more than 3 years, which is quite significant. It is one of the few stocks in the current scenario trading near its all-time high levels, reflecting relative outperformance. Due to the heavy sell-off in the markets during the last trading session, the stock witnessed Put unwinding at almost all the strikes. However, it didn’t see much short addition from current levels; rather, the stock bounced back from lower levels. Based on these observations, the probability of the stock holding onto the Rs 2,000 levels—its second-highest Put open interest—is quite high, at least on a closing basis. Below that, there is another critical support level at Rs 1,960. Therefore, the risk-reward is favourable on the long side. So, buy Kotak Mahindra Bank in the range of Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,040. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,120, Rs 2,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,960 Bajaj Finance | CMP: Rs 8,568 Bajaj Finance has also witnessed a huge range breakout—a consolidation breakout lasting more than 3 years—and the short covering is still pending. Since the prices have fallen back to the level from where it broke upwards, there is a higher probability of short covering, as the stock has not seen a significant short build-up in the recent fall from the top. While there was Put unwinding at most strikes, additions were seen at the Rs 8,400 strike. Hence, the range of Rs 8,500 to Rs 8,400 is very critical in the near term, while Rs 9,000 is an immediate hurdle, making it the first target due to the highest Call open interest. So, buy Bajaj Finance in the range of Rs 8,550 to Rs 8,650. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 9,000, Rs 9,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 8,220 SRF | CMP: Rs 2,715.2 SRF has also outperformed the overall markets recently. There has been a breakout from a huge consolidation due to sharp short covering. Although some fresh short additions were seen in the recent fall, the prices have reversed from the breakout point, making the risk-reward favourable on the long side. The Rs 2,700 strike Put has the highest open interest, while the Rs 3,000 strike Call has the highest open interest. So, the range to watch is Rs 2,700 to Rs 3,000, and since the stock is near the lower end of the range, the bulls have a favourable chance from hereon. Buy SRF in the range of Rs 2,700 to Rs 2,650. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,900, Rs 3,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,550 Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Zomato | CMP: Rs 209.63 Despite a sharp market-wide correction, Zomato outperformed, closing with only a marginal loss. The stock is forming multiple bottoms near the Rs 195 level, indicating strong support. Traders may consider entering long positions near Rs 205, with a stop-loss at Rs 195 and an upside target of Rs 225. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 225 Stop-Loss: Rs 195 GMR Airports | CMP: Rs 82.22 Unlike most F&O stocks, GMR Airports ended with gains in an otherwise volatile market. The stock witnessed a breakout above Rs 80, followed by a sharp pullback, and has now resumed its upward move. This price action suggests renewed strength and presents a potential buying opportunity. Traders may consider entering long positions near Rs 80, with a stop-loss at Rs 76 and an upside target of Rs 88. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 88 Stop-Loss: Rs 76 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments Chambal Fertilizers and Chemicals | CMP: Rs 612.8 Chambal Fertilizers, after breaking out of a rectangle pattern at Rs 546, offered no buying dips—until today. The stock has now smartly defended its 10–20 day moving average zone, giving short-term traders a golden entry into the momentum. Today’s bullish candle hints at renewed buying interest, supported by the cooling off of previously overheated momentum indicators. With the trend intact and structure strong, Chambal Fertilizers looks poised to clock fresh all-time highs in the coming sessions. Traders should watch for continued strength above support to ride the next leg up. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 700 Stop-Loss: Rs 580 PNB Housing Finance | CMP: Rs 923.65 PNB Housing Finance has defended its rounding bottom breakout impressively, even amid a falling market, with volumes consistently above the 50-day average, signaling strong institutional accumulation. For the bullish momentum to persist, the stock must hold above Rs 940. A sustained move above this level will likely lead to an initial target of Rs 1,050. The volume profile throughout the entire pattern reflects accumulation by strong hands, suggesting confidence in the stock’s long-term potential and positioning it as a frontrunner once market sentiment improves.

Fears deepened as President Trump doubled down on his hardline trade stance, threatening even steeper tariffs on China — a move that escalated an already fraught standoff and pushed US markets closer to bear territory. Also read: India well poised to take advantage of current situation: Piyush Goyal on market upheaval from Trump's tariffs The S&P 500 shed 0.8 percent, now down nearly 20 percent from its February peak — the threshold that typically signals a bear market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 988 points, or 2.6 percent, following two historic 1,500-point declines last week. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 percent and is now 24 percent below its record high, with tech stocks once again leading losses. Markets saw a brief bounce at the open on hopes that the White House might consider delaying the sweeping tariff hikes that went into effect over the weekend. But that optimism was short-lived. The administration dismissed talk of a 90-day pause as “fake news,” triggering a sharp reversal. Over the weekend, Trump defended the policy, comparing it to ""medicine"" needed to fix systemic trade imbalances. On Monday, he issued a fresh warning to China on social media, threatening to slap a 50 percent tariff unless Beijing rolled back its retaliatory measures by April 8. Talks, he added, would be suspended if China failed to comply. Read more: Warburg expected to lead troubled MFI Fusion Finance’s rights issue Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the hardline approach, telling CBS News: “The tariffs are coming... They are going to stay in place for days and weeks.” The sheer scale and speed of the tariff rollout has stunned investors. Rates have been applied across dozens of trade partners without the usual economic justifications. China, instead of seeking negotiations, retaliated immediately with a 34 percent levy on all US imports. With the administration showing little appetite for compromise, Wall Street is now pricing in a long, messy trade war. The market rout is also raising fears of forced selling, as funds scramble to raise cash to meet margin calls. The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, spiked to 50 on Monday — a level typically associated with extreme market stress. The sell-off spilled into other asset classes. Bitcoin dropped below $77,000, oil prices fell under $60 a barrel, and volatility surged. European markets slumped for a fourth straight session on Monday, caught in the global equity rout sparked by President Trump’s aggressive new tariff regime. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index dropped as much as 6 percent before trimming losses to end 4.54 percent lower. France’s CAC 40 tumbled 4.8 percent, Germany’s DAX shed 4.26 percent, and the UK’s FTSE 100 declined 4.4 percent, as fears of an escalating trade war and a prolonged downturn continued to rattle investor nerves.

Every fresh development triggers a reaction, and the uncertainty has left sellers in an aggressive mood while buyers are hesitant to commit. ""It’s futile to predict how events will unfold,"" said Nilesh Shah, Managing Director of Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company. ""What investors can do is stick to their asset allocation dharma."" According to Shah, large-cap stocks are fairly valued and deserve a neutral allocation. But any correction should be seen as an opportunity. ""Buy gradually as markets turn cheaper. That’s how you position to be overweight equities,"" he advised. Amid the global noise, Shah believes domestic stories hold promise—especially sectors like cement, building materials, and consumer discretionary, which offer strong long-term potential. He pointed to several tailwinds supporting consumption: tax rebates announced in the budget, reduced EMI burdens thanks to falling interest rates, a likely dip in oil prices, and the expected rollout of the eighth pay commission next year. Indian equities witnessed a massive bloodbath in today's session. Dalal Street went into a freefall on April 7, as panic-selling took the benchmark indices sharply lower. Triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff tantrum on Wall Street, a wave of global jitters wiped out a jaw-dropping Rs 16 lakh crore in market value — the sharpest intraday collapse since June 2024. Inflation fears, a looming consumption crunch, and recession fears had investors running for cover as the Nifty and Sensex plunged deep into the red. India VIX — the fear gauge of the domestic market — soared as much as 66 percent to 22.85 on April 7, marking its sharpest intraday spike since June 4, 2024, according to Bloomberg data.

During the trading session of April 7, FIIs bought shares worth Rs 13,372 crore and sold shares worth Rs 22,412 crore. DIIs purchased shares worth Rs 26,528 crore and sold shares worth Rs 14,405 crore.

Market Performance Dalal Street went into a freefall on April 7, as panic-selling took the benchmark indices sharply lower.

""The primary reason behind the selloff is the fear of a full-blown global trade war and its potential to tip the world economy into a recession. Countries including China, Canada, and the European Union have spoken about retaliatory tariffs on American goods, and the uncertainty around whether a settlement can be reached before the next phase of tariff hikes is causing widespread nervousness,"" Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Research and Wealth Management said in a conversation with Moneycontrol. Khemka advised against panic selling or making adventurous bets. Instead, he recommended a disciplined, long-term approach. Investors should use the correction to gradually accumulate fundamentally strong, domestically focused companies, particularly in consumption, financials, and banks. These areas are better positioned to weather global headwinds compared to globally exposed sectors like IT, pharma, and metals.

Coming off a brutal week, Monday’s losses added to the wreckage across equity markets. The Dow has now shed more than 1,200 points to trade 3 percent lower for three straight sessions— a historic first — including a staggering 2,231-point tumble on Friday. The S&P 500 lost 6 percent on the last day of the previous week, its sharpest single-day decline since the COVID crash in March 2020, wiping out 10 percent in just two sessions. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has officially entered bear market territory, now down over 22 percent from its all-time high. Investors had hoped the weekend would bring some signs of moderation or talks following President Trump’s abrupt imposition of 10 percent tariffs on nearly all key U.S. trade partners, which kicked in on Saturday. Instead, the White House struck a combative tone. ""I don’t want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,"" Trump said in a Sunday evening statement. ""We’re losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China. Until we fix that, there won’t be a deal."" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reaffirmed the administration’s firm stance, stating that the tariffs were ""definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks,"" quashing any hopes of a near-term reversal. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed the message, adding that while over 50 countries have approached the U.S. for talks, resolving the issue won’t be quick. Canada and the European Union are reportedly preparing countermeasures as well, signalling a broadening of the standoff. Wall Street now fears the selloff could spiral further, as hedge funds and institutional investors are forced to liquidate positions to meet mounting margin calls. The CBOE Volatility Index — Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge — shot up to 50 early Monday, a level rarely seen outside of major bear markets. The ripple effects were felt far beyond U.S. shores. Bitcoin crashed below $77,000, oil prices tumbled under $60 per barrel to multi-year lows, and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong nosedived 13 percent in its steepest drop since 1997. Germany’s DAX also sank, falling as much as 10 percent during Monday’s session. Among the hardest-hit U.S. stocks were high-profile names like Tesla, down 6 percent in early trade, along with Caterpillar — a global construction bellwether — which shed 5 percent. Apple also saw a sharp 4 percent drop. If the S&P 500 closes down 4 percent or more on Monday, it would mark the third consecutive day of such a steep decline — something that hasn’t happened since the depths of the Great Depression in 1933. With the administration showing no signs of backing down and retaliatory measures mounting, traders are bracing for more pain in the days ahead — unless diplomacy steps in to cool things off. As for Indian markets, Dalal Street went into a freefall on April 7, as panic-selling took the benchmark indices sharply lower. Triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff tantrum on Wall Street, a wave of global jitters wiped out a jaw-dropping Rs 16 lakh crore in market value — the sharpest intraday collapse since June 2024.

""Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,"" Trump said on his April 2 reciprocal tariffs that have since wiped trillions of dollars in company valuations. Hindustan PetroleumCrude-sensitive companies bounced back from day's lows after Brent oil price fell about 4% to $63 per barrel, its lowest since April 2021. HPCL had recovered from day’s low, but succumbed in late trade on Centre's announcement to hike excise duty. Britannia (up by 0.65% at closing) BritanniaShares of the FMCG major gained during the market mayhem, with Nifty FMCG index emerging as the least-impacted index, with 3 out of 15 constituents in the positive. The relative outperformance of FMCG is attributed to their consumer-facing nature, which provides cushion during market volatility. Trent (down by 14.77% at closing) TrentShares of Trent fell sharply by about 18% after the promoter of Zudio and Westside apparel chains announced a weak Q4FY25 business update, showing Q4FY25 revenue was lower than estimate. Bajaj Housing (down by 2.86% at closing) Bajaj HousingEven after strong provisional numbers for the March quarter, a bearish market sentiment pulled the shares of Bajaj Housing lower by 6% in trade. April is a key month for the company as the shareholder lock-in period comes to an end, and according to Nuvama, over 64 percent of Bajaj Housing Finance’s outstanding equity — about 529 crore shares — will become eligible for trade. Tata Group Tata GroupAll Tata Group stocks dipped as a part of the 'Black Monday' market crash. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Titan Company, Tata Consumer Products, and Trent, altogether witnessed Rs 1.28 lakh crore erosion in market capitalisation. Bharat Petroleum (down by 1% at closing) Bharat PetroleumShares of BPCL ended in the red with losses, however, the stock rebounded by nearly 5 percent from its day’s lows. The fall in Brent crude is expected to benefit oil marketing companies as the decline in crude prices would lower their input costs. Delhivery (down by 3.69% at closing) DelhiveryOwing to acquisition of Ecom Express, Delhivery shares defy general market sentiment and leap 4%. Estimates predict further upward movement. Delhivery has formally announced its decision to acquire a rival firm, Ecom Express Limited, for a total sum of Rs 1,407 crore. Mazagaon (down by 8.39%) Mazagon Dock ShipbuildersThe shares of Mazagon crashed nearly 10 percent, marking a downgrade for a third continuous session, fuelled by government's plans to sell up to 4.83 percent stake in the PSU defence firm.

The sharp declines came as part of a broader market rout, though analysts believe these dips may present attractive buying opportunities for investors with a long-term horizon. So far this year, both the Nifty Realty and Nifty Media indices have underperformed significantly, shedding over 20 percent each, compared to a relatively moderate 6 percent decline in the benchmark Nifty 50 index. ALSO READ: Tariff turbulence: Nifty, Sensex outperform global peers; Asian, European markets crash up to 13% Jaspreet Singh Arora, Chief Investment Officer at Equentis Wealth Advisory Services, acknowledged the pressure faced by IT and export-driven sectors due to ongoing trade tensions. However, he noted that domestic consumption-oriented sectors are better positioned to withstand external shocks. “For long-term investors, the current environment calls for discipline. Stick to your asset allocation and avoid knee-jerk reactions. As for short-term traders, the heightened volatility demands a cautious and tactical approach,” Arora added. Kranthi Bathini, Equity Strategist at WealthMills Securities, echoed similar sentiments, explaining that the downturn in Nifty Realty was largely sentiment-driven and not rooted in any specific negative fundamental developments. “Historically, Nifty Realty has been a strong performer during bullish phases. The current decline is more reflective of the overall market weakness and not due to any real deterioration in the sector’s outlook,” Bathini said. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, also supported the view that the weakness in domestic-oriented sectors like real estate and media is likely temporary. He stressed that any significant correction in these areas should be viewed as a buying opportunity. “In the context of ongoing global tariff issues, sectors tied to domestic demand are relatively safer bets,” he said. On April 7, benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty closed with sharp losses of 3 percent each, as global concerns spooked investor sentiment. Negative cues from Wall Street reverberated across world markets, including India, and fears of a looming recession combined with escalating trade tensions added to the pressure. Investor anxiety deepened following China’s retaliatory move to impose a 34 percent tariff on US goods, in response to US President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade stance—amplifying fears of a drawn-out trade war.

After a brief recovery, the markets traded in a range before closing at 22,161.60 with significant losses of 742.85 points. Selling pressure was relentless across all the sectors, with Metal and Realty segments witnessing substantial corrections. With a steep decline of over 3.50%, Mid and Smallcaps underperformed the Frontline Index. The immediate support for the Index is seen at 21,750, while resistance lies around 22,300. In the short term, the market's direction is likely to rely on the development around the tariffs; with any positive news potentially triggering a sharp recovery. On the other hand, continued negative sentiment could push the market to lower levels. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The index has fallen back into a descending channel on the daily timeframe as bearish sentiment rose amid escalating trade tensions between countries. Nifty slipped by more than 1,000 points at one point but recovered to close 418 points off the low. For the day, the index found support around the multiple support zones near 21,700. In the short term, the trend remains weak. On the higher side, resistance is placed at 22,350 and 22,550. On the lower side, support is seen at 21,900, below which the decline is likely to resume.

The sharp selloff in realty stocks pulled the Nifty Realty index down by nearly 6 percent to close at 776. While US recession and inflationary pressure remain in sight following the tariffs and counter measures by other nations, few experts suggest that the effect may spill over to the global market. Any economic slowdown is expected to create a strong slump in the real estate sector. Anant Raj shares closed nearly 8 percent lower, while those of Sobha were down over 7 percent.

""Today's sharp correction in the Indian stock markets is largely a spillover from global concerns, rather than domestic fundamentals. The recent US tariff announcements are not specifically targeted at India, they are being applied worldwide. So, while India's direct export exposure to the US is limited, the broader implications of a global tariff regime are unsettling markets everywhere. The real worry lies in how such policy moves could fuel inflation, disrupt supply chains, and trigger a slowdown or even recession over the coming years,” says Abhishek Jaiswal, Fund Manager at Finavenue.

At 3.15 pm, Delhivery’s stock was quoting Rs 267.6, higher by 3.4 percent on the NSE compared to the previous session’s closing price. Delhivery has formally announced its decision to acquire a rival firm, Ecom Express Limited, for a total sum of Rs 1,407 crore. The acquisition, undertaken as a cash deal, once completed, will make Ecom Express a subsidiary to Delhivery following regulatory approvals. Domestic brokerages JM Financials and Emkay Global reiterated their bullish ‘buy’ rating, with a target price of Rs 400 and Rs 380, respectively. “By combining forces, the companies intend to provide a more seamless and enhanced service experience to their collective customer base. Delhivery sees strategic value in Ecom’s experienced team and robust network, with the company potentially gaining the opportunity to cherry pick the right facilities,” said JM Financial. The brokerage added that after an initial period, Delhivery would take a bottom-up approach to retain the necessary Ecom Express facilities while transitioning the majority of the business to its network as substantial overlap is likely to exist. Emkay has also reiterated its ‘buy’ call. “The combined entity would command ~55-60 percent market share of the 3PL B2C express market, dwarfing the immediate peer by ~3x.

This session is the domestic benchmark index's worst single-day drop since June 4, 2024, the day of the Lok Sabha election results. Ongoing fears of global recession have wiped out a massive Rs 16 lakh crore in market value — the sharpest intraday collapse as observed since June 2024. What happened in June 2024? On June 4, 2024, the Nifty had dropped 6 percent in one day, hitting a low of 21,281 after the election outcome surprised the markets. However, the index bounced back strongly over the following three months, eventually touching a record high of 26,277. But since that peak, it has gradually fallen — and is now down around 17 percent.

This, despite the overall bearish trend in the market, with benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty being down nearly 4 percent each. Global uncertainties erupted after US President Donald Trump announced a slew of reciprocal tariffs on a number of nations, triggering trade wars and recession fears. Goldman Sachs has cut its annual average price forecast for Brent crude to $58 per barrel in 2026, citing increased recession risks and possibility of higher-than-expected OPEC+ supply. ""Oil prices would likely exceed our forecast if the US administration were to reverse tariffs sharply and deliver a reassuring message to markets, consumers, and businesses,"" the international brokerage said. The fall in Brent crude is expected to benefit oil marketing companies like Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), as the decline in crude prices would lower their input costs. Hindustan Petroleum bucked the overall market trend to trade in the green with strong gains. The shares of the company were trading nearly 2 percent higher at Rs 365 apiece. The stock has now recovered nearly 6 percent from its day’s low. Bharat Petroleum and Indian Oil shares were trading in the red with strong losses. However, both the stocks have remarkably rebounded by nearly 5 percent from their day’s lows. However, both the stocks are down over 1 percent.

In contrast, the Nifty Pharma index came under significant pressure, following indications from the Trump administration about possible tariffs on pharmaceutical imports in the future. Within the Nifty FMCG index, 3 out of 15 constituents managed to trade in positive territory despite the widespread selloff. Shares of Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Britannia, and Godrej Consumer Products posted gains of up to 0.6 percent, offering some resilience in an otherwise red-dominated market. Meanwhile, the Nifty Pharma index saw all 20 of its constituents trading in the red. Stocks such as Biocon, IPCA Laboratories, Granules India, and Divi's Laboratories recorded sharp declines in the range of 6 to 7 percent, as sentiment soured further in the sector. ALSO READ: India VIX hits 5-year high amid trade war jitters, experts warn of wild swings ahead The relative outperformance of FMCG stocks is attributed to their consumer-facing nature, which tends to provide a cushion during market volatility. These companies are primarily focused on domestic markets and have minimal exposure to exports, shielding them from external shocks such as trade tariffs or sanctions. In contrast, the pharma sector—another typically defensive play—continued to face selling pressure for the second consecutive day. This followed concerns that the US might impose tariffs on pharmaceutical imports from India. Currently, Indian drug exports to the US enjoy a tax-free status, while pharmaceutical imports from the US into India are subject to a 10 percent tariff. The Trump administration’s tariff rhetoric has raised alarms among Indian pharma companies, many of which are in a 'wait and watch' mode. Industry players have also flagged the challenges and rising costs associated with setting up manufacturing operations in the US, which could become necessary if trade restrictions are enforced.

Triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff tantrum on Wall Street, a wave of global jitters wiped out a jaw-dropping Rs 16 lakh crore in market value — the sharpest intraday collapse since June 2024. Inflation fears, a looming consumption crunch, and recession fears had investors running for cover as the Nifty and Sensex plunged deep into the red. However, day-end buying allowed markets to cut their losses with Sensex recovering 800 points from day's low to close 2,226.79 points or 2.95 percent lower at 73,137.90, and the Nifty closed 742.85 points or 3.24 percent lower at 22,161.60. About 559 shares advanced, 3,372 shares declined, and 137 shares were unchanged. India VIX — the fear gauge of the domestic market — soared as much as 66 percent to 22.85 on April 7, marking its sharpest intraday spike since June 4, 2024, according to Bloomberg data. The dramatic surge has completely erased the downtrend that had been in place since the latter half of January this year. The fall in Indian benchmarks was much lower than their European and Asian counterparts. In Asia, the Hong Kong Hang Seng's 13 percent one-day slump was the largest since 1997, while in mainland China the blue-chip CSI 300 index was down 7 percent only finding a floor when state media reported China's sovereign fund Central Huijin was a buyer. European stocks tumbled, dropping to the lowest since January 2024 as investors priced in significant economic repercussions from the global trade war initiated by Trump’s aggressive new tariff regime. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index sank as much as 6.5 percent, extending losses after its biggest weekly decline since March 2020. The gauge was trading 5 percent lower as of 11 a.m. in London, marking a level last seen at the beginning of 2024. The DAX was 5.4 percent lower after plunging as much as 10 percent. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates ""The primary reason behind the selloff is the fear of a full-blown global trade war and its potential to tip the world economy into a recession. Countries including China, Canada, and the European Union have spoken about retaliatory tariffs on American goods, and the uncertainty around whether a settlement can be reached before the next phase of tariff hikes is causing widespread nervousness,"" Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Research and Wealth Management said in a conversation with Moneycontrol. Khemka advised against panic selling or making adventurous bets. Instead, he recommended a disciplined, long-term approach. Investors should use the correction to gradually accumulate fundamentally strong, domestically focused companies, particularly in consumption, financials, and banks. These areas are better positioned to weather global headwinds compared to globally exposed sectors like IT, pharma, and metals. He added that domestic themes such as consumption remain India’s strongest long-term bet. While they may not deliver outsized short-term returns, they are likely to hold up better in a downturn. Crude-linked sectors such as oil marketing companies and aviation could also benefit from falling oil prices. Among sectoral indices, Nifty Metal was the top loser, nosediving 7 percent led by Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Hindalco, and Hindalco were the main drags. Nifty Realty, Auto, Bank, Infra, IT, Oil and Gas, and Pharma all fell in the range of 3-4 percent each. The broader market, represented by mid and smallcap 100 indices also showcased bearish trends with losses of 4 percent each. Khemka said the space is more vulnerable to a slowdown because they have limited geographical and product diversification and are more exposed to demand shocks. Tata Motors, India's leading EV player, cracked over 8 percent after its subsidiary, Jaguar Land Rover Ltd announced that it will be pausing shipments to the US for the month of April, in response to the tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on imports of automobiles and auto parts into the US. JLR last week said that it will be pausing shipments to the US for a month as it assesses the impact of the tariffs on vehicle imports. Siemens India shares nosedived over 50 percent on Monday, April 7, as the stock turned ex-demerger. It opened at Rs 2,450, a steep fall from its previous close of Rs 4,928.15, before clawing back some ground to trade around Rs 2,836.75. The demerger was carried out in a 1:1 ratio, entitling eligible shareholders to one share of Siemens Energy India for every share held in Siemens India as of the record date, April 7. The cut-off to qualify for the corporate action was Friday, April 4. ""The trend-deciding level for the day is 22,992. If Nifty trades above this level, it may further rally up to 23,127-23,349-23,484 levels. However, if it trades below 22,992 levels, we may witness profit booking in the market, and the index may correct up to 22,770-22,635-22,412 levels,"" Axis Securities said in a note. ""The trend-deciding level for the day is 51,586. If Bank Nifty trades above this level, it may rally up to 51811-52,119-52,344 levels.

This sharp selloff in the share price was fuelled after the government announced plans to sell up to 4.83 percent stake in the PSU defence firm at a floor price of Rs 2,525 per share. Notably, the shares of the Navratna company have now fallen nearly 9 percent below the floor price for the OFS. The defence PSU stock was trading at Rs 2,294 per share in the afternoon. The sharp selloff in the stock price coincides with the downturn in the overall market. Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty crashed nearly 4 percent each as US President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs stoked recession fears, which rattled global markets. Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders is currently one of the top losers on the Nifty India Defence index, which itself was down over 6 percent. The shares of the company have so far fallen over 13 percent in the last five sessions. The stock is currently nearly 22 percent lower than its 52-week high level. The OFS which opened today for retail investors, will see the government selling 1.14 crore equity shares of the company, with a greenshoe option to sell additional 80.67 lakh shares. The share sale of up to 4.83 percent stake at a floor price of Rs 2,525 a piece would fetch about Rs 5,000 crore to the exchequer.

The combined entity would command ~55-60% market share of the 3PL B2C express market, dwarfing the immediate peer by ~3x. Apart from scale benefits, given that both operators service ~97% of pincodes in India, we believe there are significant cost synergies to be realized over the next 12-18 months. Improvement in network utilization, especially in the last mile (~50% of linehaul costs in the B2C express segment), should aid profitability in our view, once networks are integrated. While valuations are fairly attractive, the acquisition is unlikely to be earnings accretive in the near term. With majority of customers being common between the two and given the learnings from the Spoton acquisition, we expect sales retention and network integration to be relatively smooth. However, concerns around Meesho increasing insourcing of logistics would continue to cast a shadow on the volume trajectory in the near term.

Shareholders will get one share of Siemens Energy India for every Siemens India share they own. The stock plunged 40 percent as part of price discovery for Siemens Energy and later rose 20% to trade above Rs 3,000. The steep cut came during the price discovery trade, where the valuation of the newly formed entity was determined based on the differential between Siemens India's April 4 closing price and the opening price of Siemens Energy on Monday. The record date for the demerger of Siemens India’s energy business was set for April 7, 2025, and the pricing process has been guided by inputs from both domestic active and passive fund managers. Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research noted that Siemens Energy’s price, until its listing, should ideally reflect the valuation gap derived during the SPOS session. The firm clarified that Siemens Energy will temporarily remain in all NSE and BSE indices — including the Nifty Next 50 — at this discovered price until its listing date. As for global passive fund managers such as MSCI and FTSE, Nuvama said no index adjustments or trading activity is expected on the record date itself, i.e., April 7. Their moves will likely follow only after the new entity lists. The market reaction highlights investor caution as the newly formed Siemens Energy begins its journey as a separately listed entity, while clarity on its standalone valuation and index inclusion continues to evolve.

All six companies, part of the benchmark Nifty 50 index, witnessed sharp declines following heightened volatility as hefty reciprocal tariffs sparked fears of global trade war. Trent emerged as the biggest loser on the index, with its shares plunging as much as 19 percent. The drop marked the company’s steepest single-day fall since March 2020, triggered by investor disappointment with its March quarter business update. Although revenue rose 28 percent year-on-year to Rs 4,334 crore from Rs 3,381 crore, the figure fell short of expectations and trailed the company’s five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36 percent. With this fall, Trent is now trading nearly 43 percent below its 52-week high, reflecting a sharp reversal in investor sentiment. ALSO READ: Midcaps, smallcaps crumble as tariff shock, US recession fears rattle investors Tata Motors also saw a significant decline of 12 percent after its subsidiary, Jaguar Land Rover, announced a pause in shipments to the US in response to the automobile import tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump. The move sparked concerns about future export disruptions and margin pressures. Tata Steel followed closely, dropping as much as 11 percent as metal stocks took a hit across the board. Investor sentiment weakened further after the US imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum imports earlier in March, with President Trump also suggesting a possible extension of tariffs to copper. While metals were not part of the latest round of reciprocal tariffs, investors remained cautious about the broader implications of an escalating trade war. Shares of TCS fell 7 percent to hit a 52-week low of Rs 3,060 apiece. The decline was attributed to growing fears of a US recession and investor caution ahead of the company’s upcoming fourth-quarter earnings. According to analysts at HDFC Securities, large IT firms are likely to report flat to marginally negative revenue growth for the March quarter, with expectations ranging from -1.8 percent to +0.1 percent on a sequential basis. The outlook has been dampened by weaker demand, reduced billing days, and lower discretionary tech spending. The rout extended to Titan Company and Tata Consumer Products, which fell 5 percent and 6 percent respectively, as concerns over consumption demand and overall market weakness weighed heavily on the stocks.

The India operations of Kalyan Jewellers reported a 39% on-year revenue growth for the March quarter, driven largely by wedding-related demand. The company said its same-store sales growth (SSSG) came in at around 21% for the quarter, while it added 25 showrooms in India during Q4FY25 and launched three more in the first week of April. In the Middle East, revenue rose by 24% compared to the same quarter last year, largely attributed to existing stores. The Middle East business accounted for roughly 12% of Kalyan’s consolidated revenue, the company said. Kalyan's digital-first platform Candere reported a 22% on-year decline in revenue, during the March quarter. The company opened 14 Candere showrooms during the Q4FY25. Looking ahead to FY26, the company reiterated plans to launch 170 new showrooms across its Kalyan and Candere formats. These would include 75 franchise-owned company-operated (FOCO) Kalyan stores outside of south India, 15 FOCO showrooms in south India and international markets, and 80 Candere showrooms in India. As of March 31, 2025, Kalyan had a total of 388 showrooms, 270 in India under the Kalyan format, 36 in the Middle East, one in America, and 73 under the Candere brand. Last week, during an exclusive chat with Moneycontrol, Kalyan's Executive Director Ramesh Kalyanaraman sounded confident that the reciprocal tariffs will have limited impact on the company's business. “Our only US store sources material from Dubai, where the export duty has now moved to 10 percent under the new tariff. So the difference is marginal"", Ramesh Kalyanaraman added, “There is no negative impact. The only change, which is very minimal, is the 3 percent increase in duty from Dubai. That cost would ultimately be passed on to the end-consumer.” Donald Trump's 26 percent reciprocal tariff on Indian goods is expected to hit the $32 billion gems and jewellery export market, of which the US accounts for about $11.58 billion, or 34 percent.

The move reignited fears of a global trade war and sent shockwaves across the Indian equity space. The Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 indices bore the brunt of the selloff, plunging as much as 6 percent and significantly underperforming the benchmark indices, which themselves saw steep declines of around 3 percent. Every single stock within the Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 universes was trading in negative territory, reflecting the intensity of the selloff. Among midcaps, shares of Mazagon Dock, Bharat Forge, and NALCO witnessed the steepest corrections, each tumbling by 10 percent. In the smallcap segment, Tejas Networks, Newgen Software, and Garden Reach Shipbuilders were among the hardest hit, with each stock declining by 11 percent. ALSO READ: Nifty IT crashes 7% as Trump doubles down on tariffs; Infosys, Coforge lead losses, tumbling 10% The sharp downturn in equities was further amplified by growing concerns over a potential recession in the US. Historically, recessionary fears in the US tend to trigger global risk aversion, leading to a pullback in foreign investment and denting investor confidence in emerging markets like India. According to online prediction platform Polymarket, there is now a 64 percent probability of a US recession in 2025—a sharp rise from the 38 percent likelihood recorded just a week ago. Investor confidence has deteriorated swiftly in the wake of these developments, with analysts noting that China’s retaliatory action has raised the risk of an escalating trade war. Kotak Institutional Equities stated that the higher-than-anticipated tariffs, coupled with a murky global macroeconomic backdrop, should lead to a more cautious investment environment. Adding to the cautious outlook, Barclays has projected a potential downside risk of 30 basis points to India’s GDP growth for FY26 due to the fallout from global trade tensions. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs anticipates a 2 to 3 percent impact on corporate earnings growth over the next couple of years as a direct consequence of the new tariff measures.

The fall in the metal stocks is in-line with the overall weakness, following the major crash on Monday morning, as US President Trump's reciprocal tariffs rattled global markets and triggered fears of a tariff war.

Vijayakumar added that investors should bear in mind that the uncertainty may not last too long, and India has been relatively better-placed than most Asian peers. ""There are a few things that investors should keep in mind. One, the irrational Trump tariffs will not continue for long. Two, India is relatively better placed since India’s exports to the US as percentage of GDP is only around 2 percent and therefore the impact on India’s growth will not be significant. Three, India is negotiating a Bilateral Trade Agreement with the US and this is likely to be successful resulting in lower tariffs for India."" US President Trump had imposed 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum imports earlier in March, and hinted at tariff on copper imports as well.

Over the past month, the stock of this private sector lender has witnessed a sharp decline of over 27 percent, largely due to an ongoing probe into discrepancies related to the bank’s derivatives portfolio. In contrast, the benchmark Nifty 50 index has outperformed, registering a rise of 1.5 percent during the same time. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog During Q4, the bank reported a 1.4 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in net advances. However, on a sequential basis, net advances fell by 5.2 percent, settling at Rs 3.47 lakh crore. Total deposits, on the other hand, grew by 6.8 percent YoY and edged up 0.4 percent QoQ, reaching Rs 4.11 lakh crore. Despite this, the bank's Current Account Savings Account (CASA) ratio slipped to 32.8 percent, down from 37.9 percent a year earlier and 34.9 percent in the preceding quarter. The corporate banking division showed signs of stress, with net advances declining 4.9 percent YoY and 15.1 percent QoQ. In contrast, the consumer banking segment posted healthy growth, with net advances increasing 6.3 percent YoY and 3.4 percent sequentially.

Brokerage firm UBS maintained its ‘Sell’ rating on IndusInd Bank and reduced its price target on the stock by 22 percent—from Rs 770 to Rs 600. UBS flagged several factors that could potentially lead to further de-rating of the stock. Major concerns include muted deposit flows, uncertainty surrounding the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and the impending findings from the external auditor’s report—elements the brokerage views as pivotal to gauging the bank’s future performance. UBS also revised its forecasts, cutting its loan growth estimate by 200 basis points to 10 percent. It further slashed its Net Interest Margin (NIM) projections by around 20 to 25 basis points for FY26 and FY27. Additionally, the brokerage has trimmed its earnings per share (EPS) estimates by approximately 14 to 15 percent for FY26 and FY27, citing lower margins and increased credit costs. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley has taken a more neutral stance, issuing an ‘Equal-Weight’ rating with a target price of Rs 1,105 per share. It described the quarter as weak, highlighting that deposit and loan growth slowed to 7 percent and 1 percent YoY, respectively. The firm noted a significant loss in market share and stated that it is awaiting more clarity on margin trends and asset quality, particularly within the microfinance institution (MFI) segment.

Track the latest updates on GIFT Nifty right here on Moneycontrol. Benchmark indices markets remained under pressure for a second consecutive session on April 4, weighed down by Trump's tariffs, as Nifty fell below 23,000 and the Sensex saw a cut of over 900 points, with the BSE mid and smallcap both down more than 3 percent at close. At close, the Sensex was down 930.67 points or 1.22 percent at 75,364.69, and the Nifty was down 345.65 points or 1.49 percent at 22,904.45. All sectoral indices ended in the red, including the pharma index, which lost 4 percent after US President Trump hinted that pharmaceuticals too are under consideration for trade tariffs. Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Down) The GIFT Nifty is trading weak at around 22,167.50, indicating a gap-down opening for the day. Asian Equities (Down) Asian stock markets plunged on Monday as fears of a global trade war saw Wall Street futures dive, and investors wagered the mounting risk of recession could see U.S. interest rates cut as early as May. US Equities (Down) Wall Street nosedived for a second straight day on Friday, confirming the Nasdaq Composite was in a bear market and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was in a correction, as an escalating global trade war spurred the biggest losses since the pandemic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite posted their largest two-day declines since the emerging coronavirus caused global panic during U.S. President Donald Trump's first term. For Thursday and Friday, the Dow was down 9.3%, the S&P 500 10.5% and the Nasdaq 11.4%. The Nasdaq slid on Friday 962.82 points, or 5.82%, to 15,587.79, confirming the tech-heavy index was in a bear market compared to its record closing high of 20,173.89 on December 16. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2,231.07 points, or 5.50%, to 38,314.86 points, confirming a correction to its record closing high of 45,014.04 on December 4.

Dollar Index (Down) Investors sold the dollar and poured into safe havens like the yen and Swiss franc on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump unleashed sweeping tariffs on the world. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar fell more than 0.2% to 102.7, having tumbled 1% last week. Asian currencies (Down) Except Japanese Yen and Indonesian Rupiah, all other Asian currencies were trading lower in the early Monday trade with Philippines Peso, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollar and Malaysian Ringgit down the most. Crude (Slips) Oil prices fell more than 3% on Monday, extending losses from the previous week, on growing concerns that a global trade war could slow the global economy and weaken oil demand, following China's retaliation against U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. Gold (Down) Gold and Silver prices lost 1 percent each in the early trade on Monday.. Fund Flow Action The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remained net sellers for fifth consecutive session on April 4 as they sold equities worth Rs 3483 crore.

57,"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Max Financial, Tata Consumer Products, MCX India, Tata Chemicals, HDFC Bank, and others on April 7?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-max-financial-tata-consumer-products-mcx-india-tata-chemicals-hdfc-bank-and-others-on-april-7-12986490.html,"The benchmark indices were caught in a bear trap with the Nifty 50 falling 1.5% on April 4 after retaliation by China, imposing a 34% tariff on US products. The market breadth was strongly in favour of declines, with about 2,159 shares seeing correction compared to 430 rising shares on the NSE. The market is expected to see more weakness in the upcoming sessions, given the dismal global cues. Below are some trading ideas for the near term: Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One Max Financial Services | CMP: Rs 1,165 Max Financial Services (MFSL) has registered a bullish breakout from multiple chart patterns. The stock has closed above its February swing high of Rs 1,160, confirming a rounding bottom breakout. Following a strong rally from the Rs 1,050 zone and a brief consolidation phase, we are now witnessing a Flag pattern breakout, indicating a strong trend resumption. Both breakouts are backed by healthy volumes and a favourable setup across key indicators. We expect this positive momentum to continue in the near term. Hence, we recommend buying MFSL around Rs 1,165 - Rs 1,155. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,265 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,115 Tata Consumer Products | CMP: Rs 1,087.85 Tata Consumer delivered strong performance despite weakness in the broader market during the last week. The stock has closed above its February swing high of Rs 1,075, establishing a higher top–higher bottom structure, which indicates the continuation of a bullish price cycle. On both the daily and weekly charts, the stock has formed strong bullish candles and closed above all major moving averages, reinforcing the positive momentum. Hence, we recommend buying Tata Consumer Products around Rs 1,088 - Rs 1,080. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,150 Stop-loss: Rs 1,048 Riyank Arora, Technical Analyst at Mehta Equities CG Power and Industrial Solutions | CMP: Rs 575.2 CG Power has touched its trendline support mark of Rs 580 on its daily charts. With the RSI (14) around 37, the stock is showing slightly oversold conditions. An ADX (Average Directional Index) of approximately 21 indicates low momentum, and based on the technical setup, the risk-reward profile favors buyers with limited downside risk from current levels. Additionally, the stock touched its major support level of Rs 570 during Friday’s trading session. We recommend buying the stock. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 625, Rs 650 Stop-Loss: Rs 555 MCX India | CMP: Rs 5,026.8 MCX India broke down below its immediate support mark of Rs 5,077 and closed below that level. With the RSI (14) around 44, the stock indicates neutral conditions. An ADX of around 18 suggests low momentum, and based on the technical setup, the risk-reward profile favors sellers at current levels. Furthermore, the stock broke below its 20-period simple moving average during Friday’s session, which is a negative sign. We recommend a sell on the stock. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 4,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,200 Tata Chemicals | CMP: Rs 812.4 Tata Chemicals broke down below its immediate support levels of Rs 840 and Rs 825 on daily charts. With the RSI (14) around 39, the stock indicates neutral conditions. An ADX of approximately 21 signals low momentum, and based on the technical setup, the risk-reward profile favors sellers at current levels. Moreover, the stock broke and closed below its 20-period simple moving average during Friday’s session, which is a negative sign. We recommend a sell on the stock. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 775, Rs 765 Stop-Loss: Rs 835 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments UltraTech Cement | CMP: Rs 11,498.65 UltraTech Cement is showing a bullish setup on the daily chart, forming a 72-day-long double bottom pattern. The stock is currently hovering near a key pivot level of Rs 11,750. What makes this setup compelling is the strong accumulation seen at the base, with volume patterns indicating that weak hands have exited after a failed low. Stronger investors now appear to be in control. Technically, any dip toward the Rs 10,800–11,200 zone offers a solid pre-emptive buying opportunity for those eyeing a medium-term upside. The structure suggests strength, and momentum could follow soon. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 12,490 Stop-Loss: Rs 10,700 HDFC Bank | CMP: Rs 1,817.3 HDFC Bank is showing strength on the daily chart, forming a 70-day-long Cup and Handle pattern—a bullish setup often seen before strong rallies. Despite a weak broader market, the stock broke out in the previous session at Rs 1,812, signaling renewed momentum. What adds weight to this move is the base-on-base structure. The current breakout is backed by two earlier bases, neither of which saw failed moves or sharp reversals. This triple base formation suggests strong institutional support. With a clean breakout in place, HDFC Bank could be setting up for sustained upside in the sessions ahead. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,950 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,750 Axis Bank | CMP: Rs 1,091.3 Axis Bank has broken out of a bullish rounding bottom pattern on the daily chart around the Rs 1,070 mark. After the breakout, the stock pulled back slightly, nearly retesting its base—an encouraging sign of strength and confirmation. The price action suggests that dips toward the Rs 1,070–1,060 zone offer a good risk-reward opportunity for traders. With momentum building and the structure intact, the stock is poised for an immediate upside target near Rs 1,192. As long as it holds above the support zone, Axis Bank remains a strong candidate for a buy-on-dips strategy. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,192 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,020 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

59,More than 90 small-caps post double-digit returns as index outperforms,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/more-than-90-small-caps-post-double-digit-returns-as-index-outperforms-12985761.html,"Broader indices remained under pressure during the week, but the small-cap index relatively outperformed despite losing 1.6 percent as domestic as well as global markets witnessed a sharp fall following the reciprocal tariff announcement by US President Donald Trump. During the week, the BSE Large-cap and Mid-cap indices fell 2.5 percent each, while the BSE Small-Cap index shed 1.6 percent. For the week, the BSE Sensex index shed 2050.23 points or 2.64 percent to close at 75,364.69, and Nifty50 fell 614.9 points or 2.61 percent to end at 22,904.45. On the sectoral front, Nifty Information Technology index records biggest weekly fall of 9 percent since COVID 2020 on global growth concerns. Nifty Metal index down 7.5 percent, Nifty Oil & Gas index shed 4 percent, while Nifty Realty and Auto indices slipped 3 percent each. ""The new financial year has commenced on a subdued note, largely driven by the imposition of higher-than-anticipated tariffs by the US. Sectors like IT and metals have underperformed relative to the broader market, reflecting growing concerns over the outlook for the US economy and potential retaliatory trade actions by other countries. Investors are expected to closely monitor any countermeasures implemented by global trade partners, which could further exacerbate geopolitical and economic uncertainty. This cautious sentiment is reflected in the sustained rally in gold and bond prices, underscoring a pronounced shift toward safe-haven assets,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""The tariffs imposed on India are relatively lower compared to those on other Asian economies, offering a degree of relief. Any constructive developments arising from the ongoing India–US bilateral trade negotiations could serve as a supportive catalyst for the market. Investor attention is also firmly fixed on the upcoming MPC meeting, with the benchmark interest rate decision expected next week. A favourable outcome could benefit rate-sensitive sectors. In addition, key macroeconomic indicators—namely India’s inflation figures and US jobless claims—will be closely watched, as they are likely to offer critical insights into the underlying economic conditions in both regions,"" he added. ""Meanwhile, market focus is gradually shifting toward the upcoming corporate earnings season. The initial outlook remains subdued, with the risk of further downward revisions to earnings growth, largely due to tepid demand and continued margin pressures. The IT sector, in particular, is expected to report soft numbers, and investor sentiment will hinge heavily on management commentary. Persistent global growth concerns and the potential for elevated inflation in the US may lead companies to delay discretionary IT spending, further dampening the sector’s near-term outlook,"" Nair added further. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) turned net sellers in this week, as they sold equities worth Rs 13,730.49 crore, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) bought equities worth Rs 5,632.56 crore. The BSE Small-cap index shed 1.6 percent with Pokarna, Garware Hi-Tech Films, Avanti Feeds, Gensol Engineering, Blue Jet Healthcare, MPS, Sharda Cropchem, Cigniti Technologies falling between 9-25 percent. However, Hester Biosciences, Baazar Style Retail, Primo Chemicals, Shiva Cement, Valiant Organics, Nacl Industries, Vadilal Industries, Sportking India, Ganesh Benzoplast, Vardhman Textiles, Parag Milk Foods, Tarsons Products rising between 21-46 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Nifty on the weekly chart slipped into weakness after the formation of doji type candle pattern in last week. We observe negative reversal pattern in the last three weekly candles. Hence, more weakness could be in store. The short-term trend of Nifty remains weak and the downward correction seems to have gained momentum. Further weakness below 22800 levels, Nifty could slide down to the next lower trajectory of around 22350 levels in the near term. Any pullback rally from here could find resistance around 23150 levels. Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Investors will be awaiting US Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech tonight, for insights into Fed’s assessment of the US economy and clues on the monetary policy outlook following the tariff announcements. Apart from developments on the US tariff front, market focus will be on RBI’s monetary policy announcement on 9th April and the Q4FY25 corporate earnings beginning with TCS results on 10th April next week. We expect market to remain volatile with sector specific action, tracking RBI’s interest rate decision, pre-quarterly business updates/Q4 results and global market cues. Aditya Gaggar, Director of Progressive Shares The market has been adversely affected by Trump’s tariff policies, causing Nifty50 to form a bearish candle on the weekly chart, and in the case of a trend continuation, the Index is likely to slide to 22,600. On the flip side, the daily chart suggests that the Index may be developing the right shoulder of an Inverted Head and Shoulders pattern, which could signal a potential reversal if it closes firmly above 23,800. The immediate resistance and support levels for Nifty50 are placed at 23,150 and 22,780, respectively. Amol Athawale, VP-Technical Research, Kotak Securities In the last truncated week, the benchmark indices witnessed selling pressure at higher levels, with the Nifty ends 2.6 percent lower while the Sensex was down by 2050 points. Among sectors, the IT index lost the most, shedding over 9 percent; however, despite the weak market sentiment, some buying interest was seen in PSU Bank stocks, resulting in the PSU Bank index gaining over 1 percent. During the week, the market breached the crucial support zone of 23,500/77400, and after this breakdown, selling pressure intensified. Technically, on the weekly charts, it has formed a long bearish candle, and on the intraday charts, it is holding a lower top formation, which supports further weakness from the current levels. We believe that after a sharp correction, the market is currently trading near the 20-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). The short-term outlook suggests that if the market reclaims the 23,000/75800 mark, we could see a pullback rally up to 23,250-23,325/76500-76800. On the flip side, fresh selling is possible only after a break below 22,800/75200. If that happens, it could slip to 22,700/74900. Further downside may continue, potentially dragging the index down to 22,500/74400.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite posted their largest two-day declines since the emerging coronavirus caused global panic during U.S. President Donald Trump's first term. For Thursday and Friday, the Dow was down 9.3%, the S&P 500 10.5% and the Nasdaq 11.4%. Fallout from Trump's sweeping tariffs stoked fears of a global recession, wiping trillions of dollars of value from U.S. companies. Highlighting growing panic among investors, the CBOE Volatility Index, or Wall Street's fear gauge, closed at its highest level since April 2020. Since late on Wednesday, when Trump boosted tariff barriers to their highest level in more than a century, investors have dumped stocks, fearing both the new U.S. economic reality and also how U.S. trading partners might retaliate by steepening their own trade barriers. A record-breaking number of shares were traded on Friday, with volume on U.S. exchanges around 26.79 billion shares, beating the previous high of 24.48 billion shares traded on January 27, 2021. The Nasdaq slid on Friday 962.82 points, or 5.82%, to 15,587.79, confirming the tech-heavy index was in a bear market compared to its record closing high of 20,173.89 on December 16. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2,231.07 points, or 5.50%, to 38,314.86 points, confirming a correction to its record closing high of 45,014.04 on December 4. The S&P 500 lost 322.44 points, or 5.97%, to close at 5,074.08 points, its lowest finish in 11 months. ""Right now, how bad it gets depends on how committed the administration is to this set of policies which, clearly, the market is voting against,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. Global governments began reacting to Trump's tariff announcement on Friday, further undermining investor sentiment that a global recession could be averted. JP Morgan said it was forecasting a 60% chance of the global economy entering a recession by year-end, up from 40% previously. China's finance ministry said it would impose additional tariffs of 34% on all U.S. goods from April 10. Meanwhile, the prime ministers of Britain, Australia and Italy held talks on how to respond to Trump's tariff salvo. ""We're in the Wild West of a trade war right now,"" said Mariam Adams, managing director at UBS Wealth Management. For the week, the S&P 500 fell 9.1%, the Dow declined 7.9%, and the Nasdaq slumped 10%. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke publicly for the first time since Trump's tariff announcement. Powell highlighted the unexpectedly hefty tariffs could trigger higher inflation and slower growth, setting the stage for challenging decisions for U.S. central bankers. Safe-haven buying in the bond market sent the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury notes to below 4%. This pushed U.S. bank stocks down further, with the sector under pressure globally, as the prospect of interest rate cuts from central banks and a hit to economic growth from tariffs would crimp profitability. The S&P Banks index (.SPXBK), opens new tab dropped 7.3%. All 11 S&P sectors dropped by more than 4.5%, with energy the leading laggard for the second straight day, off 8.7%, as companies tracked a 7.3% decline in U.S. crude prices. U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies dived, with JD.com and Alibaba and Baidu all down more than 7.7%. Companies with exposure to China also fell across the board, with mega-caps such as Apple dropping 7.3%. The chipmakers index sank 7.6%, having declined 9.9% the previous day. The sector is particularly vulnerable to a double tariff whammy as many chip companies design their chips in the U.S., but have them manufactured in China.","Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2,231.07 points, or 5.50%, to 38,314.86 points, confirming a correction to its record closing high of 45,014.04 on December 4.","Wall Street nosedived for a second straight day on Friday, confirming the Nasdaq Composite was in a bear market and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was in a correction, as an escalating global trade war spurred the biggest losses since the pandemic.","Highlighting growing panic among investors, the CBOE Volatility Index, or Wall Street's fear gauge, closed at its highest level since April 2020.","Wall Street nosedived for a second straight day on Friday, confirming the Nasdaq Composite was in a bear market and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was in a correction, as an escalating global trade war spurred the biggest losses since the pandemic.",negative,95.45%

Click here to view full list Outlook for April 7 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty has given a consolidation breakdown on the daily chart, indicating bearishness. Initially, the index found support at the crucial 22,900 level. However, sentiment remains weak, and a further decline from the current level could trigger additional market correction. On the lower end if Nifty falls below 22900 it may move toward 22676. On the higher end resistance is seen at 23100. A move above 23100 would provide a clear signal for a strong uptrend. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets came under pressure and declined by nearly one and a half percent, largely weighed down by weak global cues. After two days of lackluster movement, the Nifty slipped below its key support level of 23,100 in early trade and continued to drift lower, eventually settling at 22,904.45. Most sectors witnessed significant pressure, with metals, pharma, and energy being the worst performers. The broader indices, which had outperformed in the previous sessions, saw a sharp correction, plunging between 3% and 4%. The sharp fall in global markets—particularly in the US—and fresh concerns over potential tariffs on pharma impacted sentiment negatively. However, sustained strength in banking and financial stocks helped limit the overall downside to some extent. Looking ahead, we anticipate a time-wise correction in the Nifty index.

67,Tariff tremors: India better-placed than emerging market peers but that alone may not impress FIIs,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tariff-effect-india-better-placed-among-emerging-markets-but-that-alone-may-not-impress-fiis-12984624.html,"India may be relatively better-placed in terms of the drastic tariff levies by Donald Trump on other Asian economies, but that doesn’t imply a return of foreign inflow into the country, for FIIs may be more concerned about valuations and the earnings trajectory, several equity analysts have told Moneycontrol. Impact on India Arindam Mandal, Head of Equity Research at Marcellus said India is relatively better-positioned compared to other Asian economies when it comes to the impact of Trump’s tariffs. While many Asian countries are export-dependent, India’s economy has been largely been driven by domestic demand. ""...even while global markets are absorbing the shock, the reaction in India is cautious. FPI (foreign portfolio investor) inflows are not going to flood back just because India’s hit is slightly softer. The global mood remains risk averse,” Arindam said. He also pointed out that FIIs are more concerned about valuations and the ongoing earnings downgrades in India than any tariff-related impact. The problem stems from the fact that India's strong growth relative to the world over past few years has led to a higher base. At the same time, domestic indicators like job creation have not kept pace, creating a disconnect, he added. FII Flow - Do Tariffs Matter? Marcellus' Arindam Mandal does not think that FIIs would make a short-term move based solely on the tariff levy. ""High-quality FIIs do not typically react to short-term fluctuations. Instead, they remain cautious primarily due to valuation concerns and the lack of earnings visibility in several sectors,"" he added. “FPIs are in a cautious mode and are unlikely to make quick, bullish moves just because India appears less impacted, compared to other emerging markets,"" Mandal said. Another equity analyst, Deepak Jasani said, “FPIs’ view on emerging markets will depend on the relative hit to the growth of these economies by the Trump tariffs.” What if Tariffs Are Not Rolled Back? Deepak Jasani said emerging economies and India may be staring at an extended period of selloff, if tariffs are not rolled back substantially, or the global risk appetite begins to shrink. “We could be looking at an extended downtrend in the markets. This may start with a lag of a couple of weeks from now and may continue for some time,"" his stance remains. The eventual impact could be on India’s GDP growth and corporate earnings, he said. “As it is, these measures may dent global risk appetite, to some extent. Hence, it is important that corporate earnings are not negatively impacted,"" Jasanin added. Investors may also be fearing a second-order impact of the reciprocal tariffs, in terms of inflation, interest rates and exchange rates. ""What may be impacted are the interest rates of various countries, inflation and growth. There may also be changes in fiscal policies of the affected countries, as their trade deficits will be altered and welfare spending may need to be upped,"" he said. The veteran investor added that he would closely watch for subsequent revisions or negotiations, and in case tariffs on India turn out to be relatively lower, funds may get 'diverted from other emerging markets to India'. The exclusion of some industries from the additional tariff regime may not be of much help, Deepak Jasani said. ""The MSME (micro, small and medium-sized enterprises) sector in India that derives a good amount of revenue from the US may get hit and may need to be protected."" he added. While a large part of this uncertainty is already discounted by the markets in the current valuations and there could be some recovery, that may not last very long in Jasani's view. Deepak Jasani also told Moneycontrol that there may be other events lined up, including corporate earnings for the March quarter and RBI monetary policy meeting next week, which will be tracked more keenly. Inflationary Pressure in US Siddharth Bharme, Head of Research at Asit C Mehta believes market will react to Trump’s announcements, regardless of whether they are final or not. ""These tariffs would lead to a reduction in global trade, which is not a good thing for anyone,” said Bhamre, adding that the immediate impact of tariffs would be inflationary pressure on the global consumer. Inflation typically make FIIs cautious, as it could lead to a tighter monetary policy, which may trigger outflows from emerging markets, including India, as investors seek safer assets. Read More: Indian IT sulks on 'Liberation Day' as analysts fear risk to US demand, client spends According to Nirav Karkera of Fisdom, not every sector will be hit by the trade levies, and even those that are vulnerable might face less damage than initially feared. This selective reaction may mitigate the overall impact on India’s economy, Karkera said, especially since India leans more on domestic demand, compared to some of the export-heavy Asian and emerging economies. He also thinks India’s relatively stronger diplomatic ties with the US could mean fewer trade escalations, and possibly even an opportunity to negotiate better terms. Market expert Kranti Bathini cautioned about the lingering impact of the tariffs, extending from short to medium term, when it comes to FIIs. Some countries are likely to resort to retaliatory tariffs, which may have consequences for the global economy. ""...uncertainty is likely to remain the operative word for global markets in the coming days as well,"" Bathini said. Impact of Tariffs on Dollar, Global Order Market expert Ambareesh Baliga has cautioned that US is moving towards stagflation, and these tariffs may even push the global trade against the US dollar, possibly sparking the beginning of a change of global order. At the same time, Baliga thinks India's domestic resilience - captured by FMCG, real estate, infrastructure, and cement companies - is likely to hold up better since they are more insulated from global supply-chain disruptions. Read More: Gems & Jewellery: Can the sector keep its sparkle amid Trump's tariff blitz In the short term, FII flows might decline, even though India may be relatively better-positioned compared to other emerging market peers, said Baliga.

A report by Tata Mutual Fund said India exports nearly $6.8 billion worth of automobiles and auto components to US, and the tariff announcement is likely to impact the price competitiveness of ancillary companies too. Bharat Forge shares fell nearly 8 percent, owing to its significant exposure to US market, where Class 8 trucks having a strong export base. Bharat Forge Chairman & Managing Director Baba Kalyani had recently said that the US constitutes nearly 20 percent of its total exports, hence, the tariffs are expected to impact their revenue. The company has recently seen a strong decline in the Class 8 truck orders. As per data from ACT Research, cited by CNBC-TV18, Class 8 truck orders in North America have declined for a fourth consecutive month, further fuelling the sharp selloff. Tata Motors shares fell nearly 6 percent as the company is expected to see a significant hit from the tariffs, as subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has deep exposure to the American market. JLR sold over 4 lakh units globally in FY24, of which about 23 percent were sold in US alone. ""The US alone contributed over a fifth of JLR's total revenue last year, making it a crucial market.

Read More: LIVE Updates and News UBS said the recent policy developments and a stronger liquidity position are promising signs for SBI. The stock has seen a modest gain of around a percent in the past year compared to Bank Nifty’s 8% rise. The largest PSU lender is expected to benefit from tax rebate in the budget and the likely rollout of the Eighth Pay Commission recommendation. UBS said SBI’s liquidity has improved, reporting a surplus of about Rs 8 lakh crore in March, in contrast to a peak deficit of Rs 3.3 lakh crore earlier. UBS also raised its earnings per share (EPS) estimates for SBI by 3-5 percent, however, it remains cautious due to SBI’s relatively low Common Equity Tier I (CET I) ratio of about 11% compared to peers like HDFC Bank (17.5 percent) and ICICI Bank (16 percent). UBS said while there are positives, the balanced risk-reward profile justifies the ‘Neutral’ stance, with a revised price target of Rs 840 per share, up from the previous Rs 760. UBS upgraded Bank of Baroda to ‘Buy’, pointing to a stabilizing outlook and favourable valuations. Although BoB has faced challenges like weak NII growth and sluggish loan expansion, UBS sees reasons for optimism. Loan growth, which has remained below 12% YoY, is expected to pick up pace, supported by a healthier mix of retail loans and stable corporate asset quality. Additionally, BoB's liquidity ratios—such as a strong LCR of around 130% and an LDR of about 83%—are likely to support future loan growth, UBS said. The note said that recent correction of around 16% in BoB's stock price makes it attractively valued, trading at 0.8x Sept FY26e Price to Book Value (P/BV). The brokerage has set a revised price target of Rs 290 per share, up from Rs 270. The recalibrated outlook on SBI and BoB reflects a nuanced view by UBS of the public sector banking space, highlighting both challenges and potential catalysts for growth.

The move sparked concerns over rising inflation, slowing economic growth, and a potential escalation of global trade tensions. The S&P 500 shed around $2.4 trillion in market value—its sharpest single-day drop since March 2020—while the Nasdaq Composite plunged 5.97%, marking its largest decline since the same period. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 also recorded their worst performances since June 2020. In a research note, IFA Global stated, ""There is extreme uncertainty and panic following the announcement of reciprocal tariff rates."" The firm added that recession risks have risen sharply, with risk assets under intense pressure. Several countries have responded with retaliatory measures. French President Emmanuel Macron urged companies to pause investments in the US., while Canada imposed a 25% retaliatory tariff on American-made vehicles. Ritesh Jain, founder of Pinetree Macro, noted that the disproportionate impact on U.S. equities, combined with a weakening dollar, is highly unusual. ""This indicates that liquidity and capital are beginning to shift away from U.S. markets toward other global assets. I believe this marks the beginning of the end of U.S. market exceptionalism,"" Jain said. Investors reacted sharply to the newly imposed 10% baseline tariff on imports and the prospect of countermeasures from trading partners. Fears of an escalating trade war have amplified concerns about a global economic slowdown and rising consumer prices, exacerbating vulnerabilities in an already delicate post-pandemic recovery. Global markets mirrored Wall Street’s decline. The FTSE 100 fell 3.3%, France’s CAC 40 dropped 3%, Japan’s Nikkei declined 2.77%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 1.5%, China’s CSI 300 edged down 0.6%, and South Korea’s Kospi retreated 0.8%. India’s benchmark indices, the Sensex and Nifty, also closed 0.4% lower. Ajay Bagga, an independent market analyst, remarked that the newly dubbed ""Liberation Day"" tariffs significantly dampened investor sentiment. ""These 'Make America Wealth Again' tariffs are being viewed as counterproductive—they risk raising costs, reducing consumer choice, and suppressing demand,"" Bagga said.

The revised price target implies a potential downside of 15 percent from current levels, making it the lowest target among analysts tracking the IndusInd Bank stock. At 10:40 am on April 4, IndusInd shares were trading 3% lower at Rs 686.5 apiece. READ MORE: LIVE updates and news stories UBS has flagged multiple risk factors that could lead to a further de-rating of IndusInd Bank. The brokerage expressed concerns over deposit flows, which it believes could significantly impact the bank’s financial stability. Another area of uncertainty is the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer (CEO), which UBS sees as a potential risk factor. Additionally, the brokerage highlighted the importance of the findings from an external auditor's report, viewing them as critical indicators for the bank’s future performance. The brokerage has also revised its growth outlook for the bank. UBS has cut its loan growth estimate by 200 basis points to 10 percent, reflecting a more cautious view on the bank's lending capabilities. It has also reduced its Net Interest Margin (NIM) projections by around 20 to 25 basis points for financial years 2026 and 2027. Furthermore, credit costs are expected to remain elevated at approximately 1.7 percent in FY26, which could weigh on profitability. Consequently, UBS has trimmed its earnings per share (EPS) estimates by around 14 to 15 percent for both FY26 and FY27, driven mainly by lower margins and higher credit costs. Despite UBS's cautious stance, shares of IndusInd Bank closed 0.88 percent higher on Thursday at Rs 708.60. However, the stock has still fallen significantly—down about 55 percent from its recent high of Rs 1,576. Among the 47 analysts tracking the stock, opinions are divided, with 20 analysts giving a 'Buy' rating, 18 recommending 'Hold', and nine advising a 'Sell'. Meanwhile, IndusInd Bank has recently addressed speculation regarding a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) about alleged discrepancies in its derivatives portfolio. The bank clarified that it has not received any such report from external agencies conducting a review, countering earlier rumors that PwC would submit its findings on March 28. UBS's continued caution reflects the range of uncertainties clouding IndusInd Bank's outlook. With concerns around deposit flows, leadership transitions, and the external audit report, the brokerage remains wary of the bank's near-term prospects.",IndusInd bank shares fell 3% on April 4 as global brokerage firm UBS reiterated its bearish stance by maintaining a 'Sell' rating while sharply cutting the stock’s price target by 22 percent to Rs 600 from the earlier target of Rs 770.,IndusInd bank shares fell 3% on April 4 as global brokerage firm UBS reiterated its bearish stance by maintaining a 'Sell' rating while sharply cutting the stock’s price target by 22 percent to Rs 600 from the earlier target of Rs 770.,READ MORE: LIVE updates and news stories UBS has flagged multiple risk factors that could lead to a further de-rating of IndusInd Bank.,IndusInd bank shares fell 3% on April 4 as global brokerage firm UBS reiterated its bearish stance by maintaining a 'Sell' rating while sharply cutting the stock’s price target by 22 percent to Rs 600 from the earlier target of Rs 770.,negative,97.17%

US President Donald Trump said his administration is looking at possible tariffs on pharmaceuticals. “The pharma is going to be starting to come in at, I think, a level that you haven’t really seen before,” President Trump said speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One. Following this update, pharmaceutical stocks crashed, with the Nifty Pharma index emerging as the one of the top sectoral losers. At close, the pharma index settled lower by 4 percent, while constituents such as Aurobindo Pharma, Lupin, and IPCA Labs sank over six percent on April 4, 2025. “We are looking at pharma as a separate category -- we will be announcing that sometime in the near-future, not in the distant future”, Trump said. Earlier, Karoline Leavitt, White House Press Secretary, serving in President Donald Trump's administration since January 20, 2025 also hinted at moving pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the US. “We have outsourced our critical supplies chains in our countries. Do we want out life saving drugs and medicine and chips to be made in China or here in United States of America? This is a common sense policy,” said Leavitt. Follow our market blog to catch all the live updates In the previous session, domestic pharmaceutical players had heaved a sigh of relief in trade on April 3, while the other sectors saw intense selling pressure, as the White House had excluded pharmaceuticals products from the reciprocal tariffs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump unveiled his tariff plan for several U.S. trade partners on April 2, touted as 'Liberation Day', resulting in a ""discounted"" broad-based tariff of 26 percent on India. The is half of 52 percent that India supposedly charges U.S., including currency manipulation and trade barriers. All pharma imports to the U.S. were exempt from reciprocal tariffs, according to a White House factsheet. ""Some goods will not be subject to the Reciprocal Tariff. These include copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber articles,"" said the document. Earlier, experts had noted that India’s pharma exports to the U.S. were largely generic formulations, which would make drug access to American citizens more expensive. As a result, they had suggested it was unlikely for tariffs to be imposed on this sector. However, following this update, pharmaceutical stocks might also be in for hefty tariffs.

Additionally, the price is trading above all key exponential moving averages (20, 50, 100, and 200 EMA), reinforcing the stock’s bullish trend. On the downside, immediate support is near Rs 2,600, offering a dip-buying opportunity. If the stock corrects to this level, it may present a favourable risk-reward entry.

Sensex closed nearly 322 points lower at 76,295.36, while the Nifty 50 index dropped nearly 0.35 percent to end the session at 23,250. Pharma stocks recorded strong gains, with Nifty Pharma closing over 2 percent higher at 21,423.55, while Nifty Auto and Nifty IT significantly crashed. TCS, Tech Mahindra, HCL Tech, Infosys, Tata Motors and Kotak Mahindra Bank were the top losers on Sensex. Power Grid and Sun Pharma were the top gainers. IT stocks The Nifty IT sank over 4 percent on April 3, after US President Donald Trump imposed a broad-based tariff of 27 percent on all Indian exports. Persistent shares were the top loser on the index, closing nearly 10 percent lower at Rs 4,799 apiece, while Coforge dropped nearly 8 percent. TCS, Infosys, HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra and other IT stocks dropped over 3 percent. Tata Motors, ancillary shares Shares of auto component makers as well as Tata Motors were the worst-hit among mobility companies on April 3, fearing the worst impact of the reciprocal tariffs announced by US President Trump. In a press briefing, Trump announced that automobiles made outside the country will be charged 25 percent tariffs. Hyundai and Tata Motors shares closed around 2 percent lower. Sona BLW Precision Forgings was down over 3 percent while the shares of Bharat Forge and Samvardhana Motherson were down up to 3 percent on April 3. Shrimp feed stocks The shares of shrimp feed companies like Avanti Feeds, Apex Frozen Foods and Coastal Corp tumbled on April 3 after US President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on several nations including India. Notably, these firms have strong export exposure to US, with significant portion of their revenue being driven by the American market. Avanti Feeds shares crashed 15 percent to close at Rs 754.95 apiece, while those of Apex Frozen Foods plunged nearly 4 percent to close at Rs 207.49 apiece. Coastal Corp shares also recorded a strong downturn, falling over 8 percent to trade at Rs 36.30 apiece.

Navin Fluorine, SRF, Deepak Nitrite and other stocks saw a fall of up to 2 percent. Metal stocks The shares of metal companies posted strong losses on April 3 following US President Trump's reciprocal tariffs on concerns over global demand growth and the potential disruption to business activities across the globe. Vedanta was the top loser on the index, crashing nearly 4 percent, while Hindalco and JSW Steel shares fell over a percent each. Tata Steel, Jindal Steel & Power, Hindustan Copper and National Aluminium shares too closed nearly a percent lower, while Steel Authority of India (SAIL) ended with marginal losses. Pharma stocks Domestic pharmaceutical players heaved a sigh of relief in trade on April 3, while the other sectors saw intense selling pressure, as the White House has excluded pharmaceuticals products from the reciprocal tariffs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump. The Nifty Pharma index closed at a gain of 2.25 percent by the end of the trading session today. IPCA Labs, Sun Pharma and Lupin emerging jumped up to 5 percent at intraday, and closed in a range of 3-5 percent. Textile stocks Despite the imposition of 27 percent tariffs on Indian imports to the U.S., textile stocks outperformed in trade on April 3. The Indian textile and apparel sector is among those with the largest exposures to the U.S. However, these stocks saw sharp gains in trade, as the latest round of tariffs may help Indian exports get more competitive compared to Asian peers. With the latest reciprocal tariffs, the duties on China have increased by 34 percent, 46 percent for Vietnam and by 37 percent for Bangladesh. India, on the other hand, has only a 27 percent tariff, positioning the textile sector competitively. Following the update, stocks such as Grasim Industries, Trident, Welspun Living and Vardhman Textiles closed with gains up to 20 percent in trade. IDFC First Bank, Poonawalla Fincorp The shares of IDFC First Bank and Poonawalla Fincorp dodged the overall market trend and recorded sharp gains on April 3 after the two companies announced positive business updates about their performance in the January-March quarter of FY25. IDFC First Bank shares surged nearly 6 percent to trade at Rs 60 apiece. Notably, this is the highest level for the stock in over one month.

Shares of IT services players were hit hard over growth concern and fears of client spend being impacted, while pharma shares buck the trend after being excluded from the reciprocal tariffs. At close, the Sensex was down 322.08 points or 0.42 percent at 76,295.36, and the Nifty was down 82.25 points or 0.35 percent at 23,250.10. Broader indices outperformed the benchmarks, with BSE Midcap index rising 0.3 percent and Smallcap index adding 0.7 percent in trade. Also Read: Trump's tariff to hurt sectors most-exposed to US, as market experts assess vulnerable pockets TCS, HCL Technologies, Tech Mahindra, Infosys, ONGC were among major losers on the Nifty, while gainers included Power Grid Corp, Sun Pharma, UltraTech Cement, Cipla, Shriram Finance. On the sectoral front, IT index shed 4 percent, auto index slipped 1 percent, while pharma index added 2 percent, PSU Bank index rose 1.9 percent, power index jumped 1.8 percent. Outlook for April 4 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty opened lower following weak global cues but recovered immediately. Sentiment remains strong as the Indian market showed resilience despite weak global equity trends led by Trump's tariffs. Short-term support is placed at 23,100, and as long as the Nifty stays above this level, the trend is likely to remain strong. On the higher end, it may move towards 23,430, and a decisive move above this level could trigger a stronger rally. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets ended slightly lower on the weekly expiry day, largely weighed down by weak global cues. The Nifty index opened lower in response to the US tariff announcements but saw some recovery due to resilience in select heavyweight stocks. This helped trim losses in early trades, leading to a range-bound session before closing at 23,250.10.Sectoral trends remained mixed, keeping traders engaged—pharma and banking, particularly PSU banks, outperformed, while IT and auto sectors lagged. Broader markets, however, maintained their strength, with both midcap and smallcap indices closing in the green. The market’s measured response to the US tariffs reflects expectations of ongoing trade discussions between India and the US, as well as the possibility of higher tariffs impacting other countries more significantly, limiting the impact on Indian exports. From a technical perspective, traders should closely monitor the 20-day exponential moving average (DEMA) at 23,100. A break below this level could intensify selling pressure, potentially dragging the index toward 22,800. Conversely, holding above this level would likely sustain the range-bound movement. Amidst this consolidation, selective pockets across sectors are showing strength. Until a clear directional move emerges, the focus should remain on stock-specific opportunities.

A factsheet released by the White House showed that steel, aluminum and other articles will be exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, as the Trump administration has already imposed 25 percent tariffs on them. The exemptions include copper, on which Trump is expected to announce tariffs in the near future. Industry experts, concerned over the impact tariffs on global demand, also fear the uncertainty over potential counter-measures by China and the European Union, sparking worries over an extended trade spat. Kotak Mahindra AMC MD Nilesh Shah has warned against the increase dumping of cheap Chinese exports after US reciprocal tariffs, hurting the domestic players. ""We should negotiate hard with China to create a win-win situation rather than the usual lose-lose situation,"" Shah said.

87,Gems & Jewellery: Can the sector keep its sparkle amid Trump's tariff blitz,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gems-jewellery-can-the-sector-keep-its-sparkle-amid-trump-s-tariff-blitz-12983542.html,"The gems and jewellery sector finds itself caught in a cloud of uncertainty. Akshat Garg, AVP of Research at Choice Wealth helps in dissecting impact of the US tariffs on the gems and jewellery sector. ""The sector's reliance on the American market accounts for nearly 28% of exports (~$10 billion annually). A 26% tariff significantly erodes price competitiveness, especially against rivals like Thailand and Vietnam."" He says that the industry's margins are already running at a thin rate of 5 to 8%, and there is heavy dependence on imported raw materials wherein diamonds and gold constitute ~60% of costs. A weaker rupee further inflates input costs, compounding the pressure on profitability. Major players like Titan and Kalyan Jewellers face heightened risks of order cancellations and shrinking margins, particularly in the premium segment where U.S. consumers dominate demand. For market expert, Ambareesh Baliga, the concern is palpable. “Gems and jewellery exports are crucial,” he says. “Even if reciprocal tariffs soften the blow, the sentiment remains fragile.” It’s not just the numbers; it’s the unease among investors."" He also pointed out that most export-driven players are in the private domain, while public companies like Titan and Kalyan are more India-centric retail plays. Siddharth Bhamre, Head of Research at Asit C Mehta, takes a more balanced view. He believes the reaction may not be as harsh as some fear, but the immediate sentiment will likely be cautious. “People will tread carefully,” he admits. “Even if the impact turns out to be milder, the apprehension itself can weigh on stocks for a while,” he added in the context of the market having mostly priced in the immediate reaction. Siddharth Khemka, Head of Research at MOSL, says that it’s important to separate the retail-driven names from the export-heavy ones. “Not every company will be hit equally,” he explains. “Retail-centric brands like Titan and Kalyan Jewellers may fare better than those dependent on US exports.” Satwik Jain at Generational Capital paints a more layered picture. He believes that while large-cap names with global reach might feel some squeeze, mid-cap and smaller players—rooted in the domestic market—are likely to escape relatively unscathed. Take a look at Rajesh Exports and PC Jewellers in the midcap space while smallcap key names would be Thangamayil Jewellery and TBZ (Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri). “We’ve been through such uncertainty before,” he says. “Once things settle, quality names will probably attract buyers again. It’s just about waiting for the dust to clear,"" said market expert Kranti Bathini on an optimistic note. But for now, it’s a classic case of cautious optimism while investors with a discerning eye might still find a few sparkling opportunities amid the cautious mood.","“Gems and jewellery exports are crucial,” he says.","He believes the reaction may not be as harsh as some fear, but the immediate sentiment will likely be cautious.",“Retail-centric brands like Titan and Kalyan Jewellers may fare better than those dependent on US exports.” Satwik Jain at Generational Capital paints a more layered picture.,"“Even if the impact turns out to be milder, the apprehension itself can weigh on stocks for a while,” he added in the context of the market having mostly priced in the immediate reaction.",negative,45.10%

""The US economy has weakened in recent months, and the deteriorating macro environment will likely weigh on Q4FY25 numbers and FY26E guidance,"" Sumit Pokharna, VP - Fundamental Research, Kotak Securities said. The Kotak research analyst expects a sequential revenue decline for large Indian IT service companies because of seasonality, fewer billing days, and a slight dip in demand. The Nifty IT Index has corrected ~20% in the past three months, reflecting recession fears and tariff-related concerns. ""Investors are evaluating whether the negatives are already priced in. Any retaliatory tariffs could push inflation higher and impact the Fed’s rate cut decision, which wouldn't bode well for the IT sector,"" Pokharna said, adding that his key picks include TechM, Coforge, and Indegene along with TCS and Infosys. India’s IT sector is reliant on US demand, making it vulnerable to any slowdown triggered by heightened trade tensions. Market expert Kranti Bathani, however, is cautiously optimistic, suggesting that IT’s service-centric model might shield the companies from a 'direct fallout'. “The pressure seems to be more on manufacturing, and since Indian IT is predominantly service-oriented, it may avoid a direct hit,” Kranti Bathani said. His midcap stocks in the sector would be Coforge, KPIT Tech and Persistent Systems. Others are not as hopeful, as Siddharth Bhamre, Head of Research at Asit C Mehta has warned that while IT may not be hit by a direct tariff, the cascading effects on client budgets could still hurt. “Even if IT services aren’t directly impacted, a prolonged tariff regime could affect Indian firms due to secondary economic effects,” Bhamre said. While large and midcaps take the majority hit, the smallcap names such as Cyient, Newgen and Affle may only see a minor impact as unlike their larger counterparts, smallcap IT typically cater to domestic clients or niche sectors, making them less susceptible to global trade tensions. If Trump administration’s tariff gambit backfires and triggers US inflation in a significant way, then consumer spending could be hit, indirectly affecting sectors that are reliant on American business, including IT. The pressure on US consumers might persist, as the Fed may find it challenging to cut rates if inflation begins to creep up, hurting disposable income, and potentially companies’ IT spending. Market expert Ambareesh Baliga fears the tariffs pose a risk to the wider US economy. ""The concern here isn’t about tariffs on IT services but the potential knock-on effect of a broader economic downturn. If American businesses start tightening their belts, c for Indian IT firms,” said Baliga.

Out of already announced USD5bn India capex, HNDL is investing ~USD2bn and USD1.6bn in upstream businesses of aluminum and copper,respectively, while the rest would be spent on various downstream projects and coal mining. With captive coal mines getting ramped up by FY29E, HNDL would invest further USD2.2bn for 360ktpa smelter expansion at Mahan. With strong LME, ramping up of ongoing high margin downstream projects and improving RM security, Indian operations are expected to drive EBITDA growth over next few years. Novelis is focused on completion of USD4.1bn Bay Minnette capex by H2CY26 and targeting to ramp up over FY28-29 to replace existing ~500kt imports in the US markets. Further expansion can be planned in the next phase at a much lower capex of USD1,500/t once this 600ktpa project is commissioned. Although Novelis is working on mitigating higher scrap pricing concern by strengthening supply chain, consuming dirtier scrap and improving recycling rates, we maintain our EBITDA/t assumption of USD440/480 for FY26/27E. Near term delivery would be better on account of: a) higher volumes and better product mix, b) new higher priced can contracts, activated from CY25, and c) higher recycled content. Outlook At CMP, the stock is trading at EV of 5.8x/5.2x of FY26/27E EBITDA. Retain ‘Buy’ rating with revised TP of Rs 773 (earlier Rs804), valuing Novelis at 6.5x & standalone ops at 5.5x EV of Mar’27E EBITDA (increased from 5x on higher capex and steady contribution).

Gains in the banking and pharmaceutical sectors helped offset weaknesses in the IT and auto sectors. Analysts generally believe that Indian markets will be able to navigate the tariff challenges imposed by US President Donald Trump and may even benefit from harsher tariffs imposed on other Asian counterparts. Around noon, the Sensex was down 222 points, or 0.29 percent, at 76,395, and the Nifty was down 45 points, or 0.19 percent, at 23,287. The market breadth was positive, with approximately 2,341 shares advancing, 1,022 shares declining, and 129 shares remaining unchanged. In the broader market, small-cap stocks emerged as outperformers, while mid-cap stocks were flat to slightly negative. Sectorally, a mixed trend was observed. The Nifty IT index was the worst performer, declining due to concerns over a potential growth slowdown and reduced discretionary spending in light of the new tariff measures. Technology heavyweights such as TCS, Infosys, HCL Tech, and Wipro declined in the range of 2–3 percent. Conversely, the Nifty Pharma index was the top gainer during this period, as pharmaceutical goods were exempted from Trump's new tariff orders. Sun Pharma, Divi's Lab, and Cipla gained in the range of 3–4 percent. Analysts at Bernstein believe that India will ""safely"" navigate the tariff challenges and may even benefit from China's losses. They noted that while the 26 percent tariffs imposed on India seem high, two of India's major exports—IT services and pharmaceuticals—are untouched by this announcement. This positions India favorably compared to several South Asian economies that compete with India in these sectors but are facing higher tariffs. Viram Shah, Founder & CEO of Vested Finance, stated that the tariff-driven volatility in the market is likely to continue until the situation stabilises. He suggested that price drops may provide interesting entry opportunities into high-quality global companies at favorable valuations.

Notably, these firms have strong export exposure to US, with significant portion of their revenue being driven by the American market. Last night, Trump held up a chart showing how much tariffs US will impose on various countries. On India, the chart showed that the country charged 52 percent tariffs on the US, ""including currency manipulation and trade barriers"", and America would now charge India ""discounted reciprocal tariffs"" of 27 percent. Avanti Feeds shares crashed 15 percent to close at Rs 754.95 apiece. As of the December quarter, the company derived 69 percent of their overall revenue from the North American market, as per their investor presentation for Q3FY25. The company derived 17 percent revenue from Europe and 14 percent from Asia. Notably, its revenue from North America had fallen from 82 percent in Q3 FY24. Apex Frozen Foods shares, meanwhile, plunged nearly 4 percent to close at Rs 207.49 apiece. This marks the lowest level for the stock in nearly a month. USA was its top export market in FY24, accounting for 64 percent of its exports. “Being an export-oriented sector, any slowdown in consumption in key markets like USA, EU and South-East Asia will have an adverse impact on India’ shrimp exports,” the company had said in its investor presentation for the quarter ended December 31, 2024. Coastal Corp shares also recorded a strong downturn, falling over 8 percent to trade at Rs 36.30 apiece. The stock has now snapped its 3-day gaining streak. Notably, US is the single biggest market taking in $2.4 billion out of $5.6 billion worth of shrimp that left Indian shores. Indian shrimp constitute 40 per cent of the US market. A big chunk of Indian shrimp that makes its way to the US gets processed in some Latin American nations. There are around 1 lakh shrimp farms in India, most of which are located in Andhra Pradesh. India achieved record exports of seafood in terms of volume and value by shipping 17,35,286 tonnes of seafood worth Rs 63,969.14 crore ($8.09 billion) during 2022-23. Frozen shrimp remained the major export item in terms of quantity and value, and the US and China turned out to be major importers of Indian seafood.

In a press briefing, Trump announced that automobiles made outside the country will be charged 25 percent tariffs.

Hyundai shares tumbled nearly 2 percent to close at Rs 1,647, while those of Tata Motors were down over 2 percent to close at Rs 656 apiece. Tata Motors is likely to bear the maximum impact of the tariffs, as its luxury subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has deep exposure to the American market. JLR sold over 4 lakh units globally in FY24, of which about 23 percent were sold in US alone. ""The US alone contributed over a fifth of JLR's total revenue last year, making it a crucial market. With limited options to maintain margins and meet prior guidance, JLR will likely resort to price hikes and cost efficiencies. However, these strategies won’t yield immediate results, and a near-term hit to both revenue and profitability is expected,"" said Nirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom. ""If JLR can raise prices proportionally, the revenue impact will be minimal.

The bulls dominated the market breadth, with about 1,951 shares seeing buying interest compared to 640 declining shares on the NSE. The market is expected to react negatively to the 26% discounted reciprocal tariff on India announced by Donald Trump, but some buying can't be ruled out at lower levels. Below are some trading ideas for the near term: Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst at Mirae Asset Sharekhan Computer Age Management Services (CAMS) | CMP: Rs 3,756.75 CAMS has pulled back towards the 40-day exponential moving average support (Rs 3,654) and has witnessed buying interest. We expect this consolidation to break out on the upside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,975 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,690 Nippon Life India Asset Management | CMP: Rs 593.75 Nippon Life India has broken out of a Bullish Flag pattern on the daily charts, suggesting the resumption of the next leg of the upmove. The breakout, accompanied by above-average volume, suggests broader participation in the direction of the trend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 631 Stop-Loss: Rs 580 REC | CMP: Rs 424.55 REC has pulled back to the 20-day average (Rs 417) and witnessed buying interest. It has formed a Hammer pattern on the daily charts, which has bullish implications. A rise in volume also suggests bullish sentiment. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 461 Stop-Loss: Rs 417 Sudeep Shah, the Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities Aditya Birla Capital | CMP: Rs 190.16 Aditya Birla Capital has given a Bullish Pennant pattern breakout on Wednesday. This breakout is confirmed by relatively higher volume. In addition, it has formed a sizeable bullish candle on the breakout day, which adds strength to the breakout. Most noteworthy, the stock has surged above its 200-day EMA level for the first time since November 2024, which is a bullish sign. The daily RSI is in bullish territory and is in rising mode. The trend strength indicator, Average Directional Index (ADX), is at 28.15 and is rising, which indicates strength. The +DI is much above the -DI. This structure is indicative of bullish strength in the stock. Hence, we recommend accumulating in the zone of Rs 190-191 with a stop-loss at Rs 183. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 206 in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 206 Stop-Loss: Rs 183 Indian Hotels Company | CMP: Rs 830.15 On March 25, Indian Hotels formed a Bearish Engulfing candlestick pattern and thereafter witnessed a throwback. The throwback was halted near the 20-day EMA level and coincided with the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level of its prior upward rally (Rs 703.20-858). The stock has formed a strong base near the support zone and witnessed a strong rebound. Currently, the stock is trading above its short- and long-term moving averages. Further, the daily RSI is in bullish territory. The daily MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) stays bullish as it is quoting above its zero line and signal line. Hence, we recommend accumulating in the zone of Rs 833-827 with a stop-loss of Rs 798. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 910 in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 910 Stop-Loss: Rs 798 Shyam Metalics and Energy | CMP: Rs 914.4 Shyam Metalics and Energy has given a consolidation breakout on a daily scale. This breakout was supported by a robust volume of more than five times the 50-day average volume, indicating strong buying interest by market participants. The 50-day average volume was 4.32 lakh, while on Wednesday the stock registered a total volume of 23.39 lakh. Currently, the stock is trading above its short- and long-term moving averages. These averages are on a rising trajectory, which is a bullish sign. Further, the daily RSI is in the super bullish zone, as per RSI range shift rules. Hence, we recommend accumulating in the zone of Rs 915-905 with a stop-loss of Rs 870. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 1,010 in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,010 Stop-Loss: Rs 870 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilizers | CMP: Rs 167.01 Mangalore Chemicals maintains a higher top and higher bottom formation on the monthly scale. On the weekly chart, buying interest emerged from the 61.8% Fibonacci level, leading to a rebound from a double-bottom formation.

On the monthly scale, a key polarity shift has turned the 2022 resistance into a solid support zone, indicating a strong base for long-term growth.

The rally comes just ahead of US President Donald Trump’s April 2 tariff deadline, which the White House has confirmed will take immediate effect. At closing, Nifty was above 23,300 while Sensex rose 593 pts ahead of Trump's tariffs Losers Nestle India, HULShares of Nestle India dropped over 2% on April 2 after Bank of America (BofA) Securities downgraded the stock to 'Underperform' from 'Neutral', setting a target price of ₹2,140. The downgrade was driven by soft demand trends, cost pressures, and aggressive competition, particularly from rising commodity prices like coffee and cocoa. BofA noted that the operating environment remains challenging, which could affect the company’s near-term performance.HUL shares fell around 1.4% after BofA Securities downgraded the stock from 'Buy' to 'Neutral', cutting the target price to Rs 2,330 from Rs 2,540. While the brokerage acknowledged that the company’s performance is expected to improve from recent lows, it believes the pace of growth and margin recovery will be slower than anticipated. Hyundai Motor India Ltd (HMIL) 3) Shares of Hyundai Motor India dropped 1% to Rs 1,685 after the auto major reported modest sales growth for March 2025. Total sales rose just 2.6% year-on-year to 67,320 units, including domestic sales of 51,820 units and exports of 15,500 units. Despite being India’s second-largest passenger vehicle maker, the lukewarm growth disappointed investors, leading to the stock’s decline. Central Bank of India, Other PSU Banks 4) Central Bank of India shares plunged nearly 10% after its Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP). Other PSU banks like Indian Overseas Bank and Punjab & Sind Bank also faced declines. Analysts pointed out that investors are concerned about credit quality and asset health, especially in light of heavy loans to entities like Vodafone and subsequent partial equity conversion. This has prompted a sell-off as the market becomes more selective, favoring banks with stronger fundamentals. BHEL 5) Shares of Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) declined over 5% after the PSU defense firm missed its FY25 order inflow guidance. The company reported a turnover of around Rs 23,000 crore, which is 16% higher than the previous year but below its projected Rs 25,000 crore. At 10:10 am on April 2, BEL shares on the BSE were trading 5.3% lower at Rs 276.6 apiece.Gainers: MCX Gainers 6) Shares of Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) rebounded by 2-3% after an early dip, as Morgan Stanley highlighted the potential for regulatory approval to launch weekly options. While the brokerage maintained an 'Underweight' stance with a price target of Rs 3,400 (indicating a potential 35% downside from the current price), the expectation of new product offerings helped the stock recover. Nifty IT Index 7) The Nifty IT index gained 1.07% in intraday trade, rebounding after two sessions of losses in which it had declined by 4.21%. Eight of the ten index constituents traded in the green, with Tech Mahindra leading the gains, rising 2.21% to an intraday high of ₹1,426.05 per share on the NSE. Infosys and Wipro followed closely, gaining 1.9% and 1.12%, respectively, while Persistent Systems was up 1.64% at ₹5,297.25 per share. Only HCL Technologies and Coforge were in the red. Tata Consumer Products 8) Shares of Tata Consumer Products jumped 8.15% in early trade to an intraday high of Rs 1,073.15 on the NSE after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to 'BUY' from 'Neutral'. The global brokerage raised its price target from Rs 1,040 to Rs 1,200, citing robust growth prospects for the company’s Earnings Per Share (EPS) over FY25-FY27. The stock later pared some gains, trading at Rs 1,063.40, still up 7.17%. Kalyan Jewellers India 9) During today’s session, Kalyan Jewellers India surged 4.65% to reach Rs 480.40 in late morning trade. The stock’s rise was accompanied by increased trading volume, indicating strong investor interest and heightened market activity. This positive movement reflects a shift in sentiment compared to the previous session, possibly driven by institutional investors or large-scale buying activity. Vmart 10) Shares of V-Mart Retail posted strong gains of up to 12 percent after the companies reported positive updates for the January-March quarter of FY25. V-Mart shares rose nearly 8 percent. V-Mart Retail reported a 17 percent on-year rise in total revenue from operations to Rs 780 crore in Q4FY25. However, its digital marketplace LimeRoad saw a 47 percent decline in revenue.

103,SEBI finalizes proposal to stop the misuse of prop trading terminals,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/sebi-finalizes-proposal-to-stop-the-misuse-of-prop-trading-terminals-12982528.html,"Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has finalized a proposal to curb the misuse of proprietary trading terminals—platforms used by brokers for self-trading. According to sources familiar with the discussions, ""The policy has been broadly finalized and shared with stakeholders. Exchanges will be asked to implement it after taking input from brokers."" Brokers will be given a reasonable timeframe to comply with the proposed norms. As per the source, ""Exchanges will be required to map MAC ID as well as Static ID to ascertain the exact location of trading terminals."" If a terminal is moved, the exchange will detect the change and raise a query, helping curb misuse. In technical terms, a MAC address (Media Access Control address) is a unique 12-digit identifier assigned to a computer’s network interface. It is hardware-based and distinct for each device, enabling communication within a local network. Meanwhile, a Static IP address is a fixed, unchanging 32-bit number assigned by an internet service provider (ISP) to a computer or device for internet connectivity. While SEBI also considered geo-tagging to track terminal locations, brokers opposed it due to execution challenges and high costs. A former regulatory official commented, “If brokers want to engage in self-trading, why do they need a separate broker registration? Trades can be executed through existing broking platforms.” During inspections, SEBI and stock exchanges discovered that some brokers had developed a business model where they rented out proprietary trading terminals for a fee or commission. Since traders using these terminals were not required to pay margins—because the broker's funds with the exchange were used to cover trades—the cost of margin money was effectively bypassed. This model gained traction after SEBI implemented stricter margining rules. Regulators also found cases where a terminal was officially registered in Mumbai but was physically located in another state upon inspection. When an order flows from a broker’s system to the exchange, it must be labeled either as a client trade (CLI) or a proprietary trade (PRO). However, to evade SEBI’s margin requirements, some brokers allowed traders to use their proprietary terminals, falsely classifying client trades as proprietary. SEBI has repeatedly warned brokers against this practice and urged them to regulate their authorized persons. Moneycontrol reached out to SEBI for comments, but a response is awaited.",Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has finalized a proposal to curb the misuse of proprietary trading terminals—platforms used by brokers for self-trading.,Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has finalized a proposal to curb the misuse of proprietary trading terminals—platforms used by brokers for self-trading.,SEBI has repeatedly warned brokers against this practice and urged them to regulate their authorized persons.,"When an order flows from a broker’s system to the exchange, it must be labeled either as a client trade (CLI) or a proprietary trade (PRO).",neutral,92.87%

Click here to view full list Outlook for April 3 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Following a recent correction, the index appears to be finding support around the critical 50 EMA on the daily timeframe. Additionally, the index has been holding above the falling trendline breakout point. A bullish Harami candlestick pattern has formed on the daily chart, suggesting a potential price recovery in the short term. On the lower end, 23,100 might remain a strong support level in the short term, below which weakness could increase. On the other hand, sustaining above 23,100 might provide momentum for a rally toward 23,800. Aditya Gaggar Director of Progressive Shares The Index experienced a strong upward movement in the opening trade, followed by a lackluster performance in the mid-session. However, a sharp rally in the final hour of trading led to a positive close at 23,332.35 with gains of 166.65 points. All sectors ended in the green, with Realty and FMCG being the top performers. After a brief dip in the morning trade, Mid and Smallcaps managed to extend their gains, outperforming the frontline Index. The Index closed with a strong bullish candle, suggesting that it may be forming the right shoulder of an Inverted Head and Shoulders pattern. Strong support is seen at the 50DMA level of 23,000, while immediate support and resistance are at 23,160 and 23,430, respectively. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets rebounded after Tuesday’s decline, gaining over half a percent. Following a flat opening, Nifty edged higher and remained range-bound throughout the session, eventually closing at 23,332.35. Most key sectors contributed to the recovery, with realty, FMCG, and banking leading the gains. Meanwhile, broader indices continued their outperformance, rising nearly one and a half percent each. Markets will react to the announcement of reciprocal tariffs and the initial response from global markets, which could influence sentiment. Additionally, the scheduled weekly expiry may add to the volatility. We recommend a cautious stance and favor a hedged approach until there is greater clarity on the index’s next directional move. However, stocks continue to offer trading opportunities on both sides, and participants should position themselves accordingly.

""Looking back at March’s bullish candle, we had advocated a buy-on-dip approach, making the mentioned support levels critical.

READ MORE: LIVE updates and news stories Morgan Stanley's note maintained an 'Underweight' stance on MCX with price target of Rs 3,400 per share, reflecting a potential downside of approximately 35 percent from Tuesday’s closing price of Rs. 5,230.

In its latest financial update, MCX had reported transaction revenue of Rs 289 crore for the March quarter, marking a 4 percent decline from the previous quarter but a 60 percent rise compared to the same period last year. The revenue slightly missed Morgan Stanley’s projection of Rs 293 crore. The Average Daily Transaction Revenue (ADTR) for fourth quarter stood at Rs 3.9 crore, marginally below the estimate.

Investors remained watchful ahead of US President Donald Trump's tariff announcement, set to take immediate effect, as confirmed by the White House. At noon, the Sensex was up 412.85 points or 0.54 percent at 76,437.36, and the Nifty was up 98.75 points or 0.43 percent at 23,264.45.

""With yesterday’s decline, Nifty has retraced 38.2 percent of its recent rally and is now testing a crucial support zone around 23,100, which aligns with the 20 DEMA and 50 DEMA.

Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks as investors assessed the economic fallout of US President Donald Trump's extensive tariff plans, which have sparked worries about a US economic slowdown and higher inflation. Some of the uncertainty that has gripped markets is expected to dissipate after Trump unveils his tariff plan on Wednesday during an event in the Rose Garden, currently scheduled for 4 p.m. EDT. However, while clarity on the specific tariff measures will be welcomed by investors, the overall backdrop is set to remain highly uncertain, making it difficult for markets to agree on directionality. ""The fact of the matter is sentiment is washed out and positioning is still fairly light,"" said Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions. ""I don't think we're going to get the type of clarity that investors and business leaders want,"" he added. ""And at the end of the day, we spend a lot of time talking about tariffs, but the bigger story is we are dealing with an economy that is not firing on all cylinders."" For now, according to Melson, this means investors are ""sitting on their hands, biding their time.""

There were also gains for other Magnificent Seven stocks including Amazon.com, Microsoft and Meta Platforms, which rose between 1% and 1.8%. The S&P, however, was also weighed down by falls in healthcare and airlines. Johnson & Johnson was the worst performer on the S&P 500, falling 7.6% and dragging the broader healthcare sector down 1.8% to the bottom of the 11 S&P sectors. A U.S. bankruptcy judge rejected the company's $10 billion proposal to end tens of thousands of lawsuits alleging that its baby powder and other talc products cause ovarian cancer. Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines all dropped between 2.4% and 5.9%, as Jefferies analysts downgraded stocks amid concerns that economic uncertainty could disrupt both business and retail travel demand.

Investors are now bracing for potential sweeping tariffs, with the White House set to announce its decision on Wednesday. Reports suggest the administration is considering a 20 percent tariff on most imports, though no final call has been made. The lack of clear direction has fueled market jitters. The White House confirmed Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s tariffs will take effect immediately once announced.

A key source of uncertainty is the White House’s expected tariff announcement on Wednesday, which could impose reciprocal levies on goods from nearly all countries.

The minor patient was suffering from Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), a type of blood and bone marrow cancer, and had not responded to nine antibiotics, before taking Zaynich, Wockhardt said in its statement. ""Given the patient’s critical condition, the medical team sought approval from the USFDA for the compassionate use of Zaynich. Following the approval, the patient was treated with Zaynich for 41 days, resulting in the successful resolution of the infection and a stabilization of the patient's clinical condition,"" Wockhardt said. As many as 51 patients suffering from life-threatening Gram-negative infections have so far been successfully treated under compassionate use of Zidebactam/Cefepime, or Zaynich. Earlier in January, Wockhardt had announced that Zaynich has achieved a 96.8 percent efficacy in the Phase III study for a complicated Urinary Tract Infection. It is yet to receive approvals for market launch. During 2024, Wockhardt Chairman Habil Khorakiwala had said that once the trials are complete, the company will seek necessary regulatory approvals and hope to be in the market 'some time in 2026'. The rise in Wockhardt's share price comes on a day when the overall market trend was weak, and shares of several pharma giants crashed, pushing the Nifty Pharma down by over 1.7 percent. This comes as investors remain concerned ahead of US President Trump's April 2 deadline to impose reciprocal tariffs. Wockhardt shares have surged over 21 percent in the past one month, making a strong recovery from the 52-week low which it had hit in June last year, and scaled its 52-week high in February this year.","Shares of pharmaceutical company Wockhardt surged over two percent on April 1 after the company announced that its novel antibiotic Zaynich drug was successful in curing a severe drug-resistant infection in a 15-year old cancer patient in US under compassionate use, marking the third successful treatment by the antibiotic which is undergoing phase III study.","Shares of pharmaceutical company Wockhardt surged over two percent on April 1 after the company announced that its novel antibiotic Zaynich drug was successful in curing a severe drug-resistant infection in a 15-year old cancer patient in US under compassionate use, marking the third successful treatment by the antibiotic which is undergoing phase III study.",This comes as investors remain concerned ahead of US President Trump's April 2 deadline to impose reciprocal tariffs.,"Shares of pharmaceutical company Wockhardt surged over two percent on April 1 after the company announced that its novel antibiotic Zaynich drug was successful in curing a severe drug-resistant infection in a 15-year old cancer patient in US under compassionate use, marking the third successful treatment by the antibiotic which is undergoing phase III study.",positive,94.78%

Click here to view full list Outlook for April 2 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The index has experienced a sharp decline, approaching the 50EMA on the daily chart. This drop follows a recent phase of consolidation, signaling a weakening sentiment. However, in the near term, the 50EMA support could play a crucial role in stabilizing the market. If this level holds, we may see a recovery. That said, a decisive breakdown below 23,115 could trigger a deeper correction. On the upside, resistance is observed at 23,250—a breakout above this level could reignite bullish momentum in the market. Aditya Gaggar Director of Progressive Shares The markets experienced significant volatility during the opening trade, with an initial weak start followed by a swift recovery that proved short-lived. Selling pressure intensified, pushing the Index down to close at 23,165.70 with a significant loss of 353.65 points. Excluding the Media sector, all the other sectors ended in the red, with Realty and IT being the biggest laggards. Mid and Smallcap segments also faced pressure, but managed to outperform the Frontline Index. A strong bearish candle is formed on the daily chart, indicating that the bears have the upper hand. However, the downside appears to be limited at the 23,000 level, supported by the 50-day moving average and the market nearing oversold conditions. On the upside, the 23,430 level is expected to act as immediate resistance. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking The markets began the new financial year on a weak note, declining nearly 1.5% due to unfavorable global cues. Uncertainty surrounding the U.S. reciprocal tariff rates ahead of the April 2 deadline and its potential impact on global trade led to a negative opening, which worsened as the session progressed. As a result, the Nifty index closed near the day's low at 23,165.70 level. All major sectors came under pressure, with realty, IT, and financials among the top losers. However, the broader indices showed relative resilience, losing less than a percent each. Market participants are closely monitoring the ongoing tariff talks and their sectoral impact, leading to profit-booking following the recent rebound. Additionally, the Nifty index, which had been consolidating, has slipped below its range and breached the moving average ribbon support at 23,400. The next crucial support lies around 23,100 (20 DEMA), and a breakdown below this level could further dampen sentiment, whereas holding above it may pave the way for a recovery. Given the mixed signals, it is advisable to be cautious with index positions and maintain a stock-specific trading approach.

India's domestic pharmaceutical companies have strong exposure to US, with major portion of their revenue accruing from exports. Currently, US charges nearly zero duty on pharmaceutical imports, while India imposes around 10 percent tax on pharma imports from US. Domestic pharma companies are fearful of any potential impact due to Trump's reciprocal tariffs. Motilal Oswal, in its latest report, has said that pharma is one of the most vulnerable sectors to US reciprocal tariffs. However, it said that the overall impact of the tariffs on India's economy would be minimal. ""Overall, we believe that the impact of reciprocal tariffs (assuming full product-level reciprocity) on India will be limited on a national basis. India’s exports in the six most vulnerable sectors amount to only 1.1% of India’s GDP,"" MOSL said. International brokerage Jefferies has however said that India's generic pharma players may escape any serious action by the Trump administration owing to fears of drug price hikes in America, though some players like Zydus and Dr Reddy’s are vulnerable due to higher US exposure.

This development is expected to increase government's stake in Voda Idea from 22.6 percent to approximately 49 percent. Vodafone Idea will issue 3,695 crore equity shares with a face value of Rs 10 each, in a move that is expected to lower the outstanding debt on Voda Idea's books. Several brokerages have issued bullish calls on the stock following the development. Nomura Nomura said the government's decision is 'material positive' for Vodafone Idea as it eases concerns over the telecom operator's repayment concerns and improves outlook for any future debt raise. ""We note that VIL was liable to pay Rs 61,000 crore in spectrum dues over FY26-28F, however, following the government's action, the dues have declined to approximately Rs 20,000 crore over the period,"" the note said. ""Our calculations indicate VIL will need to secure debt funding of approximately Rs 40,000 crore over FY26-27F to manage its dues and capex plans…We believe the finalizing of the equity conversion will likely enable a faster turnaround on securing incremental capital,"" Nomura added. The brokerage also maintained its 'Buy' rating but reduced the target to Rs 10 per share from earlier Rs 12 per share. ""We believe the outlook for VIL has improved, but the future remains hinged on VIL closing its debt raise soon, which we believe is essential for it to be able to invest in networks and return to a modest subscriber growth path,"" it said. Ambit Capital Ambit Capital said the conversion of spectrum dues into equity extends Vodafone Idea a 'lifeline' as it enables the company to secure Rs 25,000 crore debt funding. This further increases Voda Idea's ability to carry out the targeted Rs 50,000 crore to Rs 55,000 crore FY25-28E capex and retain customers, adding that it needs continued tariff hikes to ""sustain capex, make good future spectrum/AGR payments and maintain a three-private player industry construct"". ""Equity funding at a 47% premium to CMP also reduces risks for VI’s equity investors. That said, given the dependence on binary outcomes like debt funding and potential AGR relief, VI remains suited for high-risk investors,"" Ambit added. The brokerage has retained a 'Buy' on the stock with a target price of Rs 15 per share. This implies an upside potential of over 120 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. Citi International brokerage Citi Research maintained a 'Buy' on the stock while keeping a target price of Rs 12 per share, which implies an upside potential of nearly 76 percent from the previous closing price. Citi said the immediate financial burden on Vodafone Idea has been relieved, but the telecom player will still face issues to raise fresh funds to expand its 4G and 5G networks. Motilal Oswal Motilal Oswal called the action by the government a ‘key medium-term positive’ for Vodafone Idea, however, added that “stabilization of its subscriber base, long-pending debt raise, and further relief on AGR dues remain vital for Vi’s long-term survival”. The brokerage added that government's continued commitment to maintaining a 3+1 market construct in Indian telecom sector and the easing of Vi’s cashflow constraint are also positive for Indus Towers. ""Vi remains a high-risk high-reward play. We raise our target price to Rs 6.5 per share, from Rs 5 earlier, driven by Government of India’s equity conversion at a premium,"" said Motilal Oswal. The latest target price however implies a downside to the current market price.

(IGL), Mahanagar Gas Ltd. (MGL), and Gujarat Gas Ltd., are in focus on Tuesday, April 1, after the government increased gas prices under the Administered Price Mechanism (APM) by 4 percent. As of 10:00 am, ONGC shares were trading at Rs 246 and GAIL shares were trading at Rs 182 apiece, both with subtle gains, while shares of IGL and MGL were trading at a decline of over a percent, at Rs 200 and Rs 1,372, respectively. READ MORE: LIVE updates and news stories This is the first hike in APM gas prices since April 2023 which allowed for a 4 percent increase from the third year of implementation. The revised APM gas price is set at $ 6.75 per mmBtu for the April to September period, up from $ 6.5 per mmBtu in the first quarter of the year. Brokerage firm Jefferies, in a recent note, highlighted that reforms in gas and crude pricing could support ONGC's Earnings Per Share (EPS) to grow at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 14 percent over FY 2025 to FY 2027. This projection is seen as a positive trigger for ONGC, given the expected revenue boost from the price hike. The development also brings attention to city gas distributors like IGL and MGL, which have been under pressure recently. As of last Friday, shares of IGL were still down 28 percent from their peak, while MGL was down 30 percent.

However, Switch UK accounted for only 0.7% of AL's consolidated revenue in FY24, highlighting its diminishing relevance at the top line. We expect the cessation of Switch UK’s operations to have a 2–4% impact on AL’s consolidated net profit in the short term due to a one-time payout of £5–10Mn (INR 553.6Mn – 1,107.1Mn). However, in the long term, the move is likely to be positive, reducing cash burn and improving economies of scale in India. The cessation is expected to eliminate monthly losses of £2–3Mn (INR 221.4Mn – 332.1Mn), potentially boosting PAT by 8–12%. With the UK operations ceasing, we expect AL to strengthen its consolidated earnings, as the business will no longer weigh down overall profitability. Outlook We do not revise our estimates following the INR 7,000Mn defense order, as the potential upside from such contract wins is already factored into our valuation.

A favorable base is further contributing to an improved growth print. Consumer sentiment is expected to pick up gradually from late 1QFY26, driven by potential interest rate cuts and fiscal measures implemented in Budget 2025.

Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty took a sharp hit, each slipping over 1 percent, weighed down by IT and financial stocks. The broader indices also bore the brunt, experiencing significant declines in the latter half of the trading day. By noon, the Sensex had plunged 1,133 points, or 1.46 percent at 76,281, while the Nifty tumbled 283 points, or 1.20 percent, to 23,236. Despite the selloff, market breadth remained positive, with 2,281 stocks advancing, 1,071 declining, and 134 remaining unchanged. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog The broader market segment, which initially showed resilience, eventually lost steam and turned red. The Nifty Midcap 100 index took a deep cut of 0.9 percent, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 index slipped around 0.1 percent in intra-day trading. Looking ahead, analysts at JM Financial noted that US President Donald Trump’s upcoming tariff announcements could trigger another wave of correction in Indian equities, depending on their severity for India. However, they observed that large-cap valuations had largely mean-reverted, whereas mid and small caps still appeared expensive. ""The mean reversion story has mostly played out, leaving limited downside potential for large caps. Meanwhile, mid and small caps have a narrow margin of safety, given their elevated valuations and little room for earnings disappointment,"" the brokerage firm stated. From a technical perspective, analysts foresee a sideways movement in the Indian markets. ""A decisive rise beyond 23,700-23,750 is required to reignite bullish momentum. Otherwise, expect sideways action with a downside bias toward 23,300,"" said Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Investments. Among sectors, Nifty IT bore the heaviest losses, dragged down by TCS, Infosys, HCL Technologies, and Wipro. The Nifty Realty index also took a severe hit, shedding 2 percent amid weakness in stocks like DLF, Macrotech Developers, Godrej Properties, and Phoenix Mills. Individually, Hindustan Aeronautics' shares soared 8 percent after securing fresh orders worth Rs 62,700 crore from the Ministry of Defence. The state-run defense giant inked two contracts with the ministry for supplying Light Combat Helicopters to the Indian Army. Meanwhile, shares of Vodafone Idea hit the 10 percent upper circuit as investors cheered the government’s decision to raise its stake in the telecom firm.

(VI) shares jumped 20 percent in trade on April 1 after the firm announced the Central government will convert its outstanding spectrum dues into equity shares. Further, shares of Indus Towers also jumped seven percent. VI will issue 3,695 crore equity shares at a price of Rs 10 per share, converting dues to stock worth Rs 36,950 crore. However, the last closing price of Vodafone Idea shares on the bourses was Rs 6.8 apiece. At 12.15 pm, shares of VI were quoting Rs 8.1 on the NSE, higher by 19 percent compared to the previous session's close. Indus Tower's stock was up 6.9 percent to quote Rs 357.35 per share.

While Asian shares rose for the first time in four days, US equity-index futures declined, showing markets remain under pressure. Stocks in Japan, Australia and South Korea opened higher. Gold held near a record high on demand for haven assets. The S&P 500 staged a late rally just as Wall Street’s “fear gauge” - the VIX index - rose for four consecutive days. Trump will announce his reciprocal tariff push on Wednesday during an event in the White House Rose Garden. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday the announcement would feature “country-based” tariffs. The Trump administration’s mixed messaging on what new tariffs are expected to be unveiled and how they’ll be announced have traders flustered as they try to position around the biggest risk confronting the market in years. Ahead of the event, investors have refrained from taking large positions amid concerns how the levies will impact economic growth and inflation in the world’s largest economy. “Wall Street managed to swing into positive territory overnight. However, rather than a sign of improving sentiment it is little more than an indicator of the heightened volatility driving two way price action,” wrote Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.com. “Attention remains fixed on the so-called ‘Liberation Day’ tariff announcement.” The president has touted his April 2 announcement as a “Liberation Day,” heralding the start of a more protectionist policy meant as retribution against trading partners he has long accused of “ripping off” the US. The president has preceded Wednesday’s tariff announcement with levies on Canada, Mexico and China — the US’s three largest trading partners — as well as automobiles, steel and aluminum. Import taxes on copper could come within several weeks. Trump has also threatened tariffs on pharmaceutical, semiconductor and lumber imports. “Tariffs will likely continue to drive the market discussion,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “Whether tariffs are more or less rigid than expected could go a long way toward shaping the market’s near-term momentum.” Though US shares still notched their worst quarter compared to the rest of the world since 2009. As equities bounced, bonds moved away from session highs. It was the first time since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020 that bonds rose and stocks fell in a three-month period. The dollar, long a go-to hiding place during market selloffs, suffered the worst start to a year since 2017. A survey conducted by 22V Research showed 73% of the investors polled do not think that uncertainty will peak on Wednesday. “Some on Wall Street are already talking about how ‘April 2’ may very well be lighter-than-feared,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers. “But others worry that this economy can’t handle a stress test of this magnitude. Stock market bulls are hoping for clear skies ahead, as uncertainty itself serves as a drag on animal spirits, consumption, and capital expenditures.” In China, there was some welcome news, as factory activity expanded at the fastest pace in a year in March. In Australia, the central bank is set to keep interest rates unchanged on Tuesday as it waits out an election campaign fought on cost-of-living issues and girds for the economic impact of a US-driven upheaval in global trade.

A total of 1,627 shares were under pressure compared to 985 shares that gained on the NSE. The market is expected to consolidate further amid caution ahead of tariffs announcements by Donald Trump. Below are some trading ideas for the near term: Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities Fortis Healthcare | CMP: Rs 6,98.35 On the daily and weekly charts, Fortis Healthcare has decisively broken out of its ""multiple resistance"" zone at Rs 680 levels on a closing basis, indicating a strong resurgence of bullish sentiment. This breakout is accompanied by huge volume, signifying increased participation. On the weekly and monthly charts, the stock is in a strong uptrend, characterized by a series of higher highs and higher lows, indicating a robust bullish trend. Recently, the stock has recaptured its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMA and rebounded sharply, showing buying force near the crucial support zone. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock, with an expected upside of Rs 777-830 and a downside support zone of Rs 670-635. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 777, Rs 830 Stop-Loss: Rs 670 Sumitomo Chemical India | CMP: Rs 559.35 On the weekly chart, Sumitomo Chemical India has confirmed a breakout from a ""down-sloping channel"" at the Rs 528 level on a closing basis, indicating a short- to medium-term resumption of the prior uptrend. The positive crossover of the 20- and 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) signifies bullish sentiment. Huge volumes on this breakout signify increased participation. The daily and weekly RSI indicators have turned bullish, indicating rising strength. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock, with an expected upside of Rs 595-645 and a downside support zone of Rs 525-515. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 595, Rs 645 Stop-Loss: Rs 525 SBI Cards and Payment Services | CMP: Rs 881.1 On the daily and weekly charts, SBI Card is in a strong uptrend, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms, indicating bullish sentiment. On the weekly chart, the stock has confirmed a breakout of the ""Flag"" continuation formation at Rs 860 levels, suggesting the continuation of the prior uptrend. It is also well-placed above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs), indicating a positive bias. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicators, RSI, have turned bullish, indicating a rise in strength. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock, with an expected upside of Rs 925-1,000 and a downside support zone of Rs 850-820. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 925, Rs 1,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 850 Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One Hindustan Zinc | CMP: Rs 461.9 Hindustan Zinc has been experiencing a significant downturn over the past couple of trading months. However, the stock has reversed its trend with the strong formation of the ‘Inverted Head & Shoulders’ pattern on the daily time frame chart. It has surged above the 20-DEMA, 50-DEMA, and 100-DEMA in recent times, being backed by a rise in volumes, indicating a potential resurgence. Additionally, weekly indicators suggest a counter-trend, making this a suitable investment opportunity in the near future. Hence, we recommend buying Hindustan Zinc around Rs 455-450. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 495, Rs 500 Stop-Loss: Rs 430 Ramco Cements | CMP: Rs 896.75 Ramco Cements has seen a decent recovery after a phase of consolidation and is now placed above the short-term EMAs and the 200 DSMA on the daily chart. The recent buying traction has been backed by a rise in trading volumes, attributing to positive developments in the counter. Additionally, the counter is comfortably placed above the SuperTrend indicator, adding to the bullish quotient. Simultaneously, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator is about to surpass the Zero line from lower levels, suggesting potential momentum in the near future. Hence, we recommend buying Ramco Cements around Rs 890-880. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 960, Rs 980 Stop-Loss: Rs 840 Ameya Ranadive, Chartered Market Technician and Senior Technical Analyst at StoxBox HDFC Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 685.7 HDFC Life is maintaining strong bullish momentum, with an upside target of Rs 720-740. The stock is trending above key moving averages, with the 10-day EMA (Rs 653) acting as dynamic support. RSI at 70.42 signals strength but is nearing overbought territory, suggesting potential consolidation before further upside. ADX (Average Directional Index) at 26.80 confirms a strengthening trend, while the MACD histogram remains positive, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Options activity and volume trends indicate sustained accumulation. A breakout above Rs 720 could lead to further gains, while Rs 650 remains a crucial support level. A close below Rs 650 would negate the bullish outlook, potentially triggering a pullback.

158,"As China and the US spar, countries brainstorm over how to cope with the trade war",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/as-china-and-the-us-spar-countries-brainstorm-over-how-to-cope-with-the-trade-war-2025-04-08/,"BANGKOK (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump and China sparred over tariff hikes and other retaliatory moves on Tuesday, as governments elsewhere were brainstorming strategies to cope with the trade war between the global economic giants. China said it will “fight to the end” and take countermeasures against the United States to safeguard its own interests after President Donald Trump threatened an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports in retaliation for Beijing's backlash against the 34% tariffs he ordered on his April 2 “Liberation Day.” “The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the US. China will never accept this,"" the Commerce Ministry said in a statement read on state-run broadcaster CCTV. When asked about the possibility of talks between Washington and Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said “I think what the US has done doesn’t reflect a willingness for sincere dialogue. If the US really wants to engage in dialogue, it should adopt an attitude of equality, mutual respect and mutual benefit.” Meanwhile, Chinese state-run companies were told to help support the country's financial markets after they were hit by massive saves of selling on Monday. While world markets calmed somewhat after frenzied selling over two trading sessions that wiped out trillions of dollars worth of wealth, leaders in Asia shifted into damage control mode. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke with Trump late Monday and then convened a task force Tuesday to mitigate damage from the 24% U.S. tariffs imposed on Washington’s biggest ally in Asia. Economic Revitalization Minister Ryosei Akazawa was appointed lead trade negotiator and senior officials were dispatched to Washington to follow up on the Ishiba's talk with Trump. Ishiba told his ministers to do their utmost to get Trump to reconsider and also to mitigate the impact from the U.S. “reciprocal” tariffs, which he said would be a blow to all industries, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters. India’s Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar spoke with his U.S. counterpart Marco Rubio late Monday, pitching for an early conclusion of negotiations for a bilateral trade agreement. India, which faces a 26% tariff on its exports to the U.S., is hoping for concessions as part of the trade deal. A first tranche of the agreement is expected by this fall. Washington wants India to allow more open market access for U.S. dairy and other farm products, but New Delhi has balked at that since farming employs the bulk of India's workforce. India’s Trade Minister Piyush Goyal planned to meet with exporters Wednesday to gauge the potential impact and cushion the economy from the tariffs. A State Department statement said Rubio and Jaishankar discussed ways to deepen collaboration, the tariffs and “how to make progress toward a fair and balanced trade relationship.” Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said his government and other Southeast Asian countries would send officials to Washington to discuss the tariffs and it was working to build a consensus on a unified response among the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as they convened an investment conference in Kuala Lumpur. “We do not believe in megaphone diplomacy,” Anwar said, “As part of our soft diplomacy of quiet engagement, we will be dispatching together with our colleagues in ASEAN our officials in Washington to begin the process of dialogue.” Still, he chided the U.S., saying Malaysia’s trade with the U.S. had long been a model of mutual gain, with its exports supporting Malaysia’s growth as well as high-quality jobs for Americans. The 24% tariff recently imposed on Malaysian imports was “harming all” and might have negative impact on both economies, he said. Anwar said Malaysia would stick to a policy of diversifying its trade at a time of uncertainty over globalization and changing supply chains. In Hong Kong, which has a free-trade policy and operates as a free port with few trade barriers, Chief Executive John Lee echoed Beijing in blasting Trump's tariffs as “bullying” and “ruthless behavior” he said had damaged trade and raised global uncertainty. Lee said the former British colony, which came under Beijing's control in 1997 but has limited autonomy, would draw closer to the Chinese mainland, sign more free trade agreements and strive to attract more foreign investment to help blunt the impact of the higher U.S. duties. ___ Niniek Karmini and Edna Tarigan in Jakarta, Rajesh Roy in New Delhi, Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo and Kanis Leung in Hong Kong contributed.",Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke with Trump late Monday and then convened a task force Tuesday to mitigate damage from the 24% U.S. tariffs imposed on Washington’s biggest ally in Asia.,"A State Department statement said Rubio and Jaishankar discussed ways to deepen collaboration, the tariffs and “how to make progress toward a fair and balanced trade relationship.” Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said his government and other Southeast Asian countries would send officials to Washington to discuss the tariffs and it was working to build a consensus on a unified response among the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as they convened an investment conference in Kuala Lumpur.",Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke with Trump late Monday and then convened a task force Tuesday to mitigate damage from the 24% U.S. tariffs imposed on Washington’s biggest ally in Asia.,"A State Department statement said Rubio and Jaishankar discussed ways to deepen collaboration, the tariffs and “how to make progress toward a fair and balanced trade relationship.” Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said his government and other Southeast Asian countries would send officials to Washington to discuss the tariffs and it was working to build a consensus on a unified response among the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as they convened an investment conference in Kuala Lumpur.",positive,81.41%
159,Canadian couple likely the only business owners on Australia's Norfolk Island to face US tariffs,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/canadian-couple-likely-the-only-business-owners-on-australias-norfolk-island-to-face-us-tariffs-2025-04-08/,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Jesse Schiller and Rachel Evans are likely the only business owners on Australia's Norfolk Island to be directly affected by the Trump administration's tariffs, as the South Pacific outpost they call home exports nothing to the United States. The Canadian couple, both aged 41, own a business that makes plastic-free hair accessories under the brand Kooshoo. Vancouver-born Schiller said he and his Norfolk Island-born wife are likely the only business owners on the island that will pay elevated tariffs — and they will pay at the rates imposed on Japan and India, where the goods are manufactured. Around 80% of Kooshoo’s business is with the United States. “Kooshoo” means “feeling good” in the English-Tahitian creole known as Norf’k or Norfuk that’s spoken among this remote population of 2,000 people 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) northeast of Sydney. “We’re probably the most affected business” on Norfolk Island, Schiller said. Norfolk Island was a shock inclusion in the Trump administration’s list of global tariffs announced last week that was intended to redress U.S. trade deficits with the world. While Australia and its external territories were assigned the global minimum 10% tariff, including the uninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands in the Antarctic region, Norfolk Island was singled out for a 29% tariff. “I think Norfolk became a parable of sorts for the lack of nuance with which these tariffs went out in the world,” Schiller said. Schiller and Evans, a Canadian-Australian dual national, have the consolation of being dealt slightly lower tariffs: Japan has been assigned a 24% tariff and India 26%. Why Norfolk Island came in for such severe and apparently futile tariff treatment has been a popular topic of conversation among locals. “It’s been a question of great intrigue locally,” Schiller said. “An early theory — and it seems to be proving right — is that there are other notable Norfolks in the world. Norfolk, of course, in the U.K., Norfolk in Virginia in the U.S., and it seems as though some improperly labeled customs paperwork may have contributed to the … error,” Schiller said. “That could’ve been very easily fact-checked,” he added. His wife, Evans, has an impressive Norfolk Islander lineage. She is a 9th generation descendant of a crewman of the British naval ship HMS Bounty who mutinied in 1789, although her mother is Canadian. The mutineers, whose exploits have been dramatized in Hollywood movies, established a settlement on Pitcairn Islands and their descendants later settled the former British penal colony of Norfolk Island. She said the sustainable lifestyle she had learned from growing up on such an isolated island around 8 kilometers (5 miles) long and 5 kilometers (3 miles) wide had been part of the brand since they started their business in Vancouver 15 years ago. She was confident their business would survive the latest trade barriers. “Definitely for the short-term we’ll figure out a way to bridge this,” Evans said.",Norfolk Island was a shock inclusion in the Trump administration’s list of global tariffs announced last week that was intended to redress U.S. trade deficits with the world.,"Vancouver-born Schiller said he and his Norfolk Island-born wife are likely the only business owners on the island that will pay elevated tariffs — and they will pay at the rates imposed on Japan and India, where the goods are manufactured.",Why Norfolk Island came in for such severe and apparently futile tariff treatment has been a popular topic of conversation among locals.,"Vancouver-born Schiller said he and his Norfolk Island-born wife are likely the only business owners on the island that will pay elevated tariffs — and they will pay at the rates imposed on Japan and India, where the goods are manufactured.",neutral,84.12%

The event aims to spotlight Pakistan’s vast reserves of copper, gold, lithium and other minerals while promoting investment opportunities in the long-overlooked sector. The Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum was inaugurated by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who said in televised remarks that “Pakistan is strategically positioned to emerge as a global mining powerhouse.” He added that the country holds one of the world’s largest unexplored reserves and is offering incentives to potential investors. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the country's powerful army chief Gen. Asim Munir also attended the event. Pakistan is home to significant mineral wealth, including world's one of the largest copper and gold deposits in Reko Diq, a district in the restive southwestern province of Balochistan, which has witnessed a surge in attacks on security forces and foreigners by Baloch separatists in recent years. Oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest but also least populated province. It is a hub for the country’s ethnic Baloch minority, whose members say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government. Pakistan says it has quelled the insurgency in Balochistan, but the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army has continued to mount attacks as recently as last month. The BLA mostly targets security forces and foreigners, especially Chinese nationals who are in Pakistan as part of Beijing’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative.

162,Lawyer says Prince Harry was unfairly treated when stripped of UK security detail,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/prince-harry-appeals-the-loss-of-his-uk-security-detail-2025-04-08/,"LONDON (AP) — Prince Harry was treated unfairly when he was stripped of his British security detail, his attorney told appeals court judges on Tuesday. Harry, who made a rare appearance in court for the hearing, lost his government-funded protection in February 2020 after he stepped down from his role as a working member of the royal family and moved to the U.S. A High Court judge ruled last year that a government panel’s decision to provide “bespoke” security for Harry on an as-needed basis was not unlawful, irrational or unjustified. But attorney Shaheed Fatima argued that a group that evaluated the Duke of Sussex’s security needs failed to follow its own process and perform a risk management assessment. “The appellant does not accept that bespoke means better,” Fatima said. “In fact, in his submission, it means that he has been singled out for different, unjustified and inferior treatment.” Harry, whose titles include the Duke of Sussex, was wearing a navy blue suit and light blue tie as he sat behind his lawyer. His surprise appearance was an indication of the case's importance to him. Harry, 40, the younger son of King Charles III, has bucked royal family convention by taking the government and tabloid press to court, where he has a mixed record. But Harry rarely shows up to court, making only a few appearances in the past two years. That included the trial of one of his phone hacking cases against the British tabloids when he was the first senior member of the royal family to enter the witness box in more than a century. Harry had claimed he and his family are endangered when visiting his homeland because of hostility aimed at him and his wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, on social media and through relentless hounding by news media. He lost a related court case in which he sought permission to privately pay for a police detail when in the U.K. but a judge denied that offer after a government lawyer argued officers shouldn’t be used as “private bodyguards for the wealthy.” He also dropped a libel case against the publisher of the Daily Mail for an article that said he had tried to hide his efforts to continue receiving government-funded security. But he won a significant victory at trial in 2023 against the publisher of the Daily Mirror when a judge found that phone hacking at the tabloid was “widespread and habitual.” He claimed a “monumental” victory in January when Rupert Murdoch’s U.K. tabloids made an unprecedented apology for intruding in his life for years, and agreed to pay substantial damages to settle his privacy invasion lawsuit. He has a similar case pending against the publisher of the Mail.","But he won a significant victory at trial in 2023 against the publisher of the Daily Mirror when a judge found that phone hacking at the tabloid was “widespread and habitual.” He claimed a “monumental” victory in January when Rupert Murdoch’s U.K. tabloids made an unprecedented apology for intruding in his life for years, and agreed to pay substantial damages to settle his privacy invasion lawsuit.","But he won a significant victory at trial in 2023 against the publisher of the Daily Mirror when a judge found that phone hacking at the tabloid was “widespread and habitual.” He claimed a “monumental” victory in January when Rupert Murdoch’s U.K. tabloids made an unprecedented apology for intruding in his life for years, and agreed to pay substantial damages to settle his privacy invasion lawsuit.","“In fact, in his submission, it means that he has been singled out for different, unjustified and inferior treatment.” Harry, whose titles include the Duke of Sussex, was wearing a navy blue suit and light blue tie as he sat behind his lawyer.",He lost a related court case in which he sought permission to privately pay for a police detail when in the U.K. but a judge denied that offer after a government lawyer argued officers shouldn’t be used as “private bodyguards for the wealthy.” He also dropped a libel case against the publisher of the Daily Mail for an article that said he had tried to hide his efforts to continue receiving government-funded security.,negative,70.21%
163,Scholarships for child care are drying up. Now families are paying the price,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/scholarships-for-child-care-are-drying-up-now-families-are-paying-the-price-2025-04-08/,"PHOENIX (AP) — For parents who need to work but can't afford the steep cost of child care, federally funded scholarships can be a lifeline. Delivered through state child care assistance programs, the scholarships can mean the difference between a parent working full time — or not at all. But qualified families increasingly are being turned away, thanks to the rising costs of child care and the end of pandemic-era funds, and some families that had scholarships have seen them end. In at least three states — Arizona, Colorado and Texas — parents who apply face long waitlists. Other states, including Nevada and Oklahoma, have increased copayments for parents or have said they will serve fewer children. In Idaho, enrollment was paused for part of last year. Last week, the Trump administration laid off some employees who helped states implement child care assistance. It's all left advocates worried about the future of federal child care programs. “What it means is that ultimately child care will become less safe, it’s going to become more expensive, and it’s going to become harder to find,” said Ruth Friedman, who was the director of the Office of Child Care under former President Joe Biden. As part of Trump's sweeping cuts to the federal government, the administration eliminated jobs in the Office of Child Care, which oversees federal child care subsidies and ensure states are enforcing safety standards. All staff in five of the 10 regional offices were cut, along with more in the office’s headquarters in Washington. They included staff who upheld federal safety requirements for child care providers and ensured subsidies were being used effectively. They worked with states to enforce requirements to run background checks on child care employees. They also safeguarded programs from waste and fraud. During the pandemic, Congress approved record spending to boost the child care industry, recognizing its importance to restarting the economy. States received $24 billion to help child care providers boost wages, buy masks and air purifiers and train staff, plus an extra $15 billion for child care assistance scholarships. That money expired in September. Congress declined to extend it, despite a push from Biden and child care advocates. Since then, some states have attempted to continue programs with their own taxpayers' money. But many, such as Arizona, have ended special pandemic-era programs, like those that helped teachers pay for child care. Now, Arizona parents who apply for basic child care assistance are put on waitlists — with no clear end in sight. “There’s a much bigger need than there are funds,” said Kim Kofron of the Texas-based advocacy group Children at Risk. “We know all of these families are willing to work.” In Phoenix, child care worker Janeth Ibarra would have paid nothing last year for care for her twin boys, because she would have received a special scholarship for those in her field. This year, her income qualifies her for regular state child care assistance. But because the state ran low on money for the program, she was on a waitlist earlier this year. As it stands, Ibarra, 22, earns $16.50 an hour and is paying more than $1,200 a month for child care, after a steep discount from her employer. “Even with overtime, it’s barely survivable,” Ibarra said. At the end of last year, Ibarra had to spend the last of her savings on special formula for one of her sons, a purchase not covered by her food assistance benefits. She tried to breastfeed more to save money. In Idaho, where lawmakers in 2023 rejected pandemic aid for child care, the state stopped accepting applications for its child care assistance program. When the applications resumed, the state tightened income restrictions. Now, the only families who qualify earn less than 130% of the federal poverty line, or $41,795 for a family of four. Before, a family of four could earn up to $56,000 and still receive a scholarship. In Colorado, a dozen counties stopped accepting new applications for the state's child care assistance program because they ran out of money, The Colorado Sun reported. Trump has been vague on his plans to make child care more affordable. He said during his campaign that he believed tariffs would rake in “trillions of dollars.” Child care, he added, is, “relatively speaking, not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we’ll be taking in.” Economists, though, have warned tariffs could cause prices for other household goods to skyrocket, squeezing family budgets, and it’s unlikely there would be much money left over for the government to spend if Trump successfully implements steep tax cuts. Advocates are concerned child care funding could be cut as the president seeks to shrink the federal government. For states trying to maintain child care assistance scholarships, the costs of running the programs have risen. Because many child care providers operate in the margins, the Biden administration increased the amount they receive when they take scholarship students. It's all evidence the problems that vex the child care industry have not necessarily abated with the pandemic, said Karen Schulman, senior director of child care policy at the National Women’s Law Center. “The crisis was going on long before COVID,” Schulman said, citing the unaffordability of care for many families, along with the low pay of the child care workforce. Even as providers struggle to make a profit, child care is prohibitively expensive for many families. In a study of 2022 child care prices, the Labor Department found the median cost of care for an infant in a center was more than $15,600 in large counties — higher than the median rent in many places. When Brooklyn Newman divorced her husband, she moved with her two boys, now 2 and 4, into a trailer while she got back on her feet. The Phoenix mother was eager to send her older boy to preschool so he could have structure as the family weathered the split. But she could not afford tuition for her younger son until the preschool gave her a scholarship funded by pandemic aid. With both boys in school half-time, Newman could put in more hours at her job as a freelance business analyst. But when the scholarship ended, she had to pay out of pocket — adding $1,000 a month to her preschool tuition. She made a painful trade-off: She juggled working in the evening while watching her children at home — sacrificing quality time with them so she can earn enough money to continue to send them to preschool. “I’m constantly behind a computer, you know, giving everything I can,” Brooklyn said earlier this year, her voice tightening with emotion. Occasionally, her sons will hide her computer mouse to keep her from working. But she can see growth from their time in preschool — in their language, in their confidence, in their relationships with teachers and classmates. “You’re watching them grow. It’s just the best feeling. And that’s why I do everything I can to have them there.” ___ The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

164,Trump says high tariffs may have prevented the Great Depression. History says different,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-says-high-tariffs-may-have-prevented-the-great-depression-history-says-different-2025-04-07/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In the early days of the Great Depression, Rep. Willis Hawley, a Republican from Oregon, and Utah Republican Sen. Reed Smoot thought they had landed on a way to protect American farmers and manufacturers from foreign competition: tariffs. President Herbert Hoover signed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, even as many economists warned that the levies would prompt retaliatory tariffs from other countries, which is precisely what happened. The U.S. economy plunged deeper into a devastating financial crisis that it would not pull out of until World War II. Most historians look back on Smoot-Hawley as a mistake that made a bad economic climate much worse. But tariffs have a new champion in President Donald Trump. Like Trump, Hoover was elected largely because of his business acumen. An international mining engineer, financier and humanitarian, he took office in 1929 like an energetic CEO, eager to promote public-private partnerships and use the levers of government to promote economic growth. “Anyone not only can be rich, but ought to be rich,” he declared in his inaugural address before convening a special session of Congress to better protect U.S. farmers with “limited changes of the tariff.” Instead, the 31st president got the Great Depression. Trump, now championing his own sweeping tariffs that have sent global markets into a tailspin, argues that the U.S. was founded on steep import taxes on goods from abroad. But the country began abandoning them when it created a federal income tax in 1913, the president says. Then, ""in 1929, it all came to a very abrupt end with the Great Depression. And it would have never happened if they had stayed with the tariff policy,” Trump said in announcing his tariff plan last week. Referring to Smoot-Hawley, he added, “They tried to bring back tariffs to save our country, but it was gone. It was gone. It was too late. Nothing could have been done — took years and years to get out of that depression.” America’s history of high tariffs actually continued well after 1913, however, and Trump’s take on what sparked the Great Depression — and Hoover-era Washington's response to it — don't reflect what actually happened. Gary Richardson, an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine, said the U.S. long maintaining high tariffs “helped to shift industry here. But we’ve gotten rid of them because, as the country at the cutting edge of technology, we didn’t think they were useful.” “When we were at our most powerful, right after World War II, we forced a low tariff regime on most of the world because we thought it was to our benefit,"" said Richardson, also a former Federal Reserve System historian. ""Now, we’re going back to something else.” George Washington signed the Tariff Act of 1789, the first major legislation approved by Congress, which imposed a 5% tax on many goods imported into the U.S. With no federal income tax, the policy was about finding sources of revenue for the government while also protecting American producers from foreign competition. After the War of 1812 disrupted U.S. trade with Great Britain, the U.S. approved more tariffs in 1817 meant to shield domestic manufacturing from potentially cheaper imports, especially textiles. High tariffs remained for decades, particularly as the government looked to increase its revenue and pay down debt incurred during the Civil War. The Tariff Act of 1890 raised taxes to 49.5% on 1,500-plus items. Championing the move was the “Napoleon of Protectionism,” William McKinley, an Ohio Republican congressman who would be elected president in 1896 and one of Trump's heroes. But that move caused prices to rise and the U.S. economy to fall. It worsened after the Panic of 1893, when unemployment reached 25%. Historians referred to the period as the “great depression” until it was superseded by the actual Great Depression. A national income tax didn't become permanent until Congress passed the 16th Amendment in 1909, and it was ratified four years later. Despite what Trump suggests, what followed was continued economic growth — fueled by technological advances like the telephone and increased consumer spending after World War I. A construction boom, and increased manufacturing output — particularly for consumer goods that included the automobile — helped spark the “Roaring 20s."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased six-fold — climbing from 63 points in August of 1921 to nearly 400 in September of 1929. It was the Prohibition era and the jazz age, a period of urbanization even as farming remained a key economic driver. Working conditions were often poor, but the standard of living climbed for the middle class, which enjoyed innovations like broadcast radio and washing machines. High tariff policy also persisted, with Congress approving the Fordney-McCumber Act of 1922, which raised levies to their highest in U.S. history on many imported goods in an effort to further bolster domestic manufacturing. That prompted retaliatory tariffs from key U.S. trading partners — mirroring the reactions of contemporary China and other countries to Trump’s new levies. The economy began slowing when the Fed raised interest rates in 1928 and the following year. The idea was mostly to ease a stock market bubble by reducing lending to brokers or firms buying stocks. But that triggered higher interest rates in Britain and Germany, which helped slow global consumer spending and production, and began a U.S. recession in the summer of 1929. The Great Depression began with “Black Tuesday” on Oct. 29, 1929, when a panic selloff triggered a stock market collapse, wiping out thousands of investors who had borrowed heavily. As consumer demand declined, manufacturing firms laid off workers and idled factories. In subsequent years, the U.S. unemployment rate reached 25%, while economic output plunged nearly 30%. There were thousands of bank failures and widespread business closures, while millions of Americans lost their homes. With self-made wealth and global sympathies, Hoover cut a very different figure than Trump. Hoover was orphaned at 9 and led World War I-humanitarian food relief efforts while living in London. He also served as commerce secretary before running for president. He could be dynamic with small groups but reserved in public. “There’s no theater to Herbert Hoover,"" said David Hamilton, a history professor at the University of Kentucky. Trying to keep his campaign promise to protect farmers, Hoover pushed Congress for higher agricultural tariffs. But a chief goal was encouraging farmers to produce new types of crops, and Hoover didn't view steeper U.S. tariffs as incompatible with global trade, Hamilton said. “He’s not weaponizing trade in the way we see today,” said Hamilton, author of “From New Day to New Deal: American Farm Policy from Hoover to Roosevelt, 1928-1933."" Hawley, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, originally sought farming protections. But the finished bill went much farther, using high tariffs to protect manufacturing. It passed the House in May 1929. Smoot, who chaired the Senate finance committee, helped oversee passage there in March 1930. Reconciled legislation that became the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act finally cleared Congress that June. Hoover was conflicted, especially after more than 1,000 U.S. economists signed a letter urging a veto. But he signed the act, saying in a statement, “No tariff bill has ever been enacted, or ever will be enacted, under the present system that will be perfect.” That's all a departure from another businessman-turned-president, Trump, who grew up wealthy and was a real estate mogul and reality TV star who had never served in government before first winning the presidency in 2016. Trump has long championed tariffs as a way to protect the U.S. economy and manufacturing at the expense of its global trading partners. And he bypassed Congress potentially modifying the scope of his policy aims by declaring an “economic emergency” to institute tariffs unilaterally. Smoot-Hawley raised import tariffs by an average of 20% on thousands of goods, causing many top U.S. trading partners to retaliate. International cooperation on non-trade issues also declined, including on defense matters, helping clear the way for the rise of Hitler, Richardson said. “There were some industries where they made profits,” Richardson said of Smoot-Hawley. “But overall, people in the U.S. and people around the world were losers.” U.S. manufacturers saw foreign markets for their goods evaporate and output and consumer spending sank still further. Hawley lost the 1932 Oregon Republican primary in his district, and Smoot was defeated in November, as Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt trounced Hoover for the presidency. Smoot, Hawley and Hoover largely kept defending their tariff policies in subsequent years, blaming international trade policies and external monetary forces — as well as Democrats — for America's economic woes. The economy wouldn’t begin its recovery until the outbreak of World War II increased demand for factory production in 1939. “Economic depression cannot be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement,” Hoover said in December 1930. ""Economic wounds must be healed by the action of the cells of the economic body -- the producers and consumers themselves.",Trump has long championed tariffs as a way to protect the U.S. economy and manufacturing at the expense of its global trading partners.,"""Now, we’re going back to something else.” George Washington signed the Tariff Act of 1789, the first major legislation approved by Congress, which imposed a 5% tax on many goods imported into the U.S. With no federal income tax, the policy was about finding sources of revenue for the government while also protecting American producers from foreign competition.","But a chief goal was encouraging farmers to produce new types of crops, and Hoover didn't view steeper U.S. tariffs as incompatible with global trade, Hamilton said.","""Now, we’re going back to something else.” George Washington signed the Tariff Act of 1789, the first major legislation approved by Congress, which imposed a 5% tax on many goods imported into the U.S. With no federal income tax, the policy was about finding sources of revenue for the government while also protecting American producers from foreign competition.",neutral,81.39%

Comptroller-General Anel Flores said the audit found some payment defaults, accounting miscalculations and some “shadow” operation of companies that the Hong Kong company originally denied, causing Panama around $300 million in lost revenue. The release of the audit of Panama Ports Company, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate subsidiary that operates ports at both ends of the Panama Canal, comes as U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration alleges Chinese interference in the canal's operations, which Panamanian authorities have denied. It also happens the same day the U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrives to the Central American country to participate in a subregional security conference. “There are many violations that will have to be explained,” the Panamanian comptroller said. He added that the audit’s results will be sent to Panama’s Maritime Authority, which oversees the ports and has the power to terminate a contract. Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings conglomerate did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Panama Ports Company won a concession in 1997 to operate the ports of Balboa, in the Pacific, and Cristobal, in the Atlantic, and it was renewed in 2021 for 25 more years. Trump has threatened to retake control of the Panama Canal, arguing that the U.S. should have never turned control over to the Panamanians more than two decades ago. Some days ago, while the audit was underway, CK Hutchison said it has agreed to sell its controlling stake in Panama Ports Company to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control. The Panamanian government maintains it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group’ operations of the ports did not mean a Chinese control over the canal.",The Panamanian government maintains it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group’ operations of the ports did not mean a Chinese control over the canal.,The Panamanian government maintains it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group’ operations of the ports did not mean a Chinese control over the canal.,Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings conglomerate did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.,PANAMA CITY (AP) — Panama’s comptroller authority said Monday an audit found irregularities in the renewal of a 25-year port concession in the interoceanic canal and it would request an investigation into the authorization of the contract to a Hong Kong company.,negative,85.89%
166,The Latest: China vows countermeasures over Trump tariffs as trade war threatens to intensify,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-latest-china-vows-countermeasures-over-trump-tariffs-as-trade-war-threatens-to-intensify-2025-04-07/,"China says it will “fight to the end” and take countermeasures against the United States to safeguard its own interests after President Donald Trump threatened an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports. The Commerce Ministry said Tuesday the U.S.‘s imposition of “so-called ‘reciprocal tariffs’” on China is “completely groundless and is a typical unilateral bullying practice.” Trump’s threat Monday of additional tariffs on China raised fresh concerns that his drive to rebalance the global economy could intensify a financially destructive trade war. Stock markets from Tokyo to New York have become more unstable as the tariff war worsens. World shares and U.S. futures advanced Tuesday, led by gains in Tokyo where the Nikkei 225 shot up just over 6% as markets calmed somewhat after the shocks from President Donald Trump ’s tariff hikes. ___ Here's the latest: Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto vowed to build the country’s economy with the goal of standing on “our own feet” as his administration scrambles to contain market jitters following an American decision to impose a 32% import tariff on the country's goods. He met investors, market players and economists in Jakarta on Tuesday to formulate how to strengthen Indonesia’s economic resilience. “What is happening now, the world is in turmoil due to the world’s strongest economy country making policies to increase tariffs so high for many countries,” Subianto said in his opening speech at the meeting. He said the resulting uncertainty underlined the need to ""rely more on ourselves to build our economy with our own feet.” During the meeting, Chief Economic Minister Airlangga Hartarto emphasized that the Indonesian government will not take any retaliatory measures and has sent a request letter for negotiations on the reciprocal tariff policy through the United States Trade Representative the Secretary of Commerce. “What America wants is a balancing of the trade balance,” Hartarto said, “We will increase our purchase of American products.” World shares and U.S. futures advanced Tuesday, led by gains in Tokyo where the Nikkei 225 shot up just over 6% as markets calmed somewhat. The modest rebound for most markets followed a wild day on Wall Street, where stocks careened after Trump threatened to crank his double-digit tariffs higher. Germany’s DAX gained 0.9% to 19,975.81 while the CAC 40 in Paris was up 1.3% at 7,018.79. Britain’s FTSE 100 also picked up 1.3%, to 7,804.73. The future for the S&P 500 gained 1.5% early Tuesday while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.9%. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 closed a smidgen over 6% higher, at 33,012.58. Hong Kong also recovered some lost ground, but nothing close to the 13.2% dive Monday that gave the Hang Seng its worst day since 1997, during the Asian financial crisis. The Hang Seng gained 1% to 20,036.03. The Shanghai Composite index jumped 1.4% to 3,140.15 after the government investment fund Central Huijin directed state-owned companies to help support the market with share purchases. The Pakistan Stock Exchange recovered 1.5% on Tuesday after going down 3.3% overall the previous day. The latest development comes a day after Pakistani stocks went down, with Islamabad facing 29% tariffs from the U.S. The improvement in the stock market came after authorities said the U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had spoken with Pakistan’s deputy premier Ishaq Dar about economic cooperation. Pakistan plans to send a government delegation to Washington this month to negotiate the issue of tariffs with the administration. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is urging China to avoid escalating a tariff war with the United States and to help ensure that Chinese products don’t flood other markets due to the fallout. In a phone call with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, von der Leyen “called for a negotiated resolution to the current situation, emphasizing the need to avoid further escalation,” her office said Tuesday. She “underscored the vital importance of stability and predictability for the global economy,” and said that it was up to Europe and China “to support a strong reformed trading system, free, fair and founded on a level playing field.” The commission negotiates trade deals and disputes on behalf of the 27 EU member countries. It is setting up a task force to monitor for any dumping as the tariffs hit trade flows. China's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday questioned America's “willingness for sincere dialogue” and said Beijing would “fight to the end” after Trump threatened to impose more tariffs. “I think what the U.S. has done doesn’t reflect a willingness for sincere dialogue,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a news briefing. ""If the U.S. really wants to engage in dialogue, it should adopt an attitude of equality, mutual respect and mutual benefit. If the U.S. disregards the interests of both countries and the international community and insists on a tariff war and trade war, China will surely fight to the end,” Lin added. Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar spoke with his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, late Monday to push for an early conclusion of negotiations over a bilateral trade deal. The call came days after the U.S. slapped a 26% tariff on Indian imports. India wants to seek concessions as part of the trade deal, the first tranche of which is expected by fall. Brendan Lynch, a U.S. assistant trade representative, visited India last month to discuss the initial contours of the deal. The U.S is pushing India to grant greater market access for agricultural and dairy products, but New Delhi is reluctant since its farm sector employs the bulk of the country’s workforce and is a main source of family income. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim says his government and others in Southeast Asia will send a delegation to Washington to discuss the tariff situation. In a keynote speech Tuesday at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ Investment Conference in Kuala Lumpur, Anwar said ASEAN leaders would try to build a consensus and present a united response to Trump's tariffs. “We do not believe in megaphone diplomacy,” Anwar said. “As part of our soft diplomacy of quiet engagement, we will be dispatching together with our colleagues in ASEAN our officials in Washington to begin the process of dialogue.” Indonesia’s stock market plunged 9.2% in early trading on Tuesday, as markets in the Southeast Asian country reopened after an extended Eid holiday break. Its currency, the rupiah, also sank to a record low, hitting 16,846 against the U.S. dollar. The Indonesia Stock Exchange halted trading for 30 minutes following the steep decline. When it resumed, shares recovered slightly but remained down nearly 8%. Hong Kong leader John Lee has described the latest U.S. tariffs as “bullying,” saying the “ruthless behavior” has damaged global and multilateral trade and brought great risks and uncertainties to the world. At a news conference on Tuesday, Lee pledged to take several steps to address the tariffs. He said the city would seize more opportunities in China’s development, sign more free trade agreements with other economies, and continue to push for Hong Kong’s accession to the 15-nation Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. He also vowed to advance international financial cooperation, attract foreign companies and capital to Hong Kong, and support Hong Kong enterprises to cope with the tariff impacts. New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has delivered stronger criticism of the U.S. tariffs, decrying what he says is a “shift away from agreed rules” of trade and warning of the risk of “backsliding into a global trade war.” “A trade war is in nobody’s interests,” Luxon told reporters in Wellington on Tuesday. “It will slow global growth, hurt jobs and reduce the amount of money we have in our wallets.” He said New Zealand, which is set to receive the 10% baseline tariff rate on goods exported to the U.S., would not impose retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. The U.S. in January overtook Australia to become New Zealand’s second-largest export partner, behind China, with New Zealand exports largely made up of meat, dairy, wine and agricultural machinery. Asian markets opened higher on Tuesday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 benchmark shooting up more than 6% after it fell nearly 8% a day earlier. The rebound followed a wild day on Wall Street as U.S. stocks careened after Trump threatened to crank his double-digit tariffs higher. Hong Kong also recovered some lost ground, but not anything close to its 13.2% dive on Monday that gave the Hang Seng its worst day since 1997 during the Asian financial crisis. The Hang Seng gained 1.7% to 20,163.97 on Tuesday morning. The Shanghai Composite index jumped 0.8% to 3,121.72, South Korea’s Kospi gained 1.6% to 2,364.22, and the S&P/ASX 200 also was up 1.6%, at 7,462.60. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba met with his Cabinet on Tuesday to discuss how to respond to the U.S. tariffs, after he spoke by phone late Monday with Trump. Ishiba has appointed Ryosei Akazawa, the economy revitalization minister, as Japan's trade negotiator with the U.S., Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said Tuesday. The appointment was based on an agreement between Ishiba and Trump, Hayashi added. Japan's prime minister also dispatched senior officials from the foreign and trade ministries to Washington to follow up on his conversation with Trump. Ishiba is considering traveling to Washington for direct talks with Trump at an appropriate time, Hayashi said. At Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting, Ishiba instructed his ministers to fully examine and mitigate the tariffs' impact on Japanese industries and pursue diplomatic efforts to address them. Ishiba told his ministers the tariffs would be a blow to all industries.

168,China says it will 'fight to the end' after Trump threatens to impose still more tariffs,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/china-threatens-to-countermeasures-after-trump-threatens-additional-50-tariff-2025-04-07/,"BEIJING (AP) — China said Tuesday it would “fight to the end” and take countermeasures against the United States to safeguard its own interests after President Donald Trump threatened an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports. The Commerce Ministry said the U.S.‘s imposition of “so-called ‘reciprocal tariffs’” on China is “completely groundless and is a typical unilateral bullying practice.” China, the world's second-largest economy, has announced retaliatory tariffs and the ministry hinted in its latest statement that more may be coming. “The countermeasures China has taken are aimed at safeguarding its sovereignty, security and development interests, and maintaining the normal international trade order. They are completely legitimate,” the ministry said. “The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the U.S. China will never accept this. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end,"" it added. Trump's threat Monday of additional tariffs on China raised fresh concerns that his drive to rebalance the global economy could intensify a financially destructive trade war. Stock markets from Tokyo to New York have become more unstable as the tariff war worsens. Trump’s threat came after China said it would retaliate against U.S. tariffs he announced last week. “If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!” If Trump implements his new tariffs on Chinese products, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would reach a combined 104%. The new taxes would be on top of the 20% tariffs announced as punishment for fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34% tariffs announced last week. Not only could that increase prices for American consumers, it could also give China an incentive to flood other countries with cheaper goods and seek deeper relationships with other trading partners, particularly the European Union. On the streets of Beijing, people said they found it hard to keep track of all the announcements, but expressed belief in their country's ability to weather the storm. ""Trump says one thing today and another tomorrow. Anyway, he just wants benefits, so he can say whatever he wants,"" said Wu Qi, 37, who works in construction. Others were less sanguine. Paul Wang, 30, who sells stainless accessories, including necklaces, bracelets, and tongue studs to Europe, said the European market was now more important after the extra U.S. 50% tariffs and he would be watching to see which other firms in his field would be competing in that space. Jessi Huang and Yang Aijia, whose companies import chemicals from the U.S., said the tariffs, including potential Chinese retribution, could force them to close up shop. “It would be very hard and very likely to have a layoff, maybe even closing,” Huang said, “I might not be able to find another job if I get laid off.” China still has a range of options to strike back at the Washington, experts said, including suspending cooperation on combating fentanyl, placing higher quotas on agricultural products and going after the U.S. trade in services in China such as finance and law firms. U.S. total goods trade with China was an estimated $582 billion in 2024, making it the top trader in goods with the U.S. The 2024 deficit with China in goods and services trade was between $263 billion and $295 billion. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian appeared to give short shrift to talk of dialogue with the Trump administration. “I don't think what the U.S. has done reflects a willingness for sincere dialogue. If the U.S. really wants to engage in dialogue, it should adopt an attitude of equality, mutual respect and mutual benefit,” Lin said. In Hong Kong, where stocks were slightly higher Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee blasted the latest U.S. tariffs as “bullying,” saying the “ruthless behavior” has damaged global and multilateral trade and brought great risks and uncertainties to the world. Lee said the city would link its economy closer to China’s development, sign more free trade agreements, attract more foreign companies and capital to Hong Kong, and support local enterprises in coping with the impact of the tariffs. ___ Associated Press writers Chris Megerian and Josh Boak in Washington, Christopher Bodeen in Taipei, Taiwan, and Kanis Leung in Hong Kong contributed to this report.","The Commerce Ministry said the U.S.‘s imposition of “so-called ‘reciprocal tariffs’” on China is “completely groundless and is a typical unilateral bullying practice.” China, the world's second-largest economy, has announced retaliatory tariffs and the ministry hinted in its latest statement that more may be coming.","The Commerce Ministry said the U.S.‘s imposition of “so-called ‘reciprocal tariffs’” on China is “completely groundless and is a typical unilateral bullying practice.” China, the world's second-largest economy, has announced retaliatory tariffs and the ministry hinted in its latest statement that more may be coming.",Trump's threat Monday of additional tariffs on China raised fresh concerns that his drive to rebalance the global economy could intensify a financially destructive trade war.,"“It would be very hard and very likely to have a layoff, maybe even closing,” Huang said, “I might not be able to find another job if I get laid off.” China still has a range of options to strike back at the Washington, experts said, including suspending cooperation on combating fentanyl, placing higher quotas on agricultural products and going after the U.S. trade in services in China such as finance and law firms.",negative,94.07%

The modest rebound for most markets followed a wild day on Wall Street, where stocks careened after Trump threatened to crank his double-digit tariffs higher. Early Tuesday, China's Commerce Ministry said it would “fight to the end” and take unspecified countermeasures against the United States after Trump threatened another 50% tariff on Chinese imports. Germany's DAX gained 0.9% to 19,975.81 while the CAC 40 in Paris was up 1.3% at 7,018.79. Britain's FTSE 100 also picked up 1.3%, to 7,804.73.

South Korea’s Kospi picked up 0.3% to 2,334.23, while the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia climbed 2.3% to 7,510.00. Markets in Thailand and Indonesia tumbled, however, as they reopened after holidays. Trading was suspended briefly in Jakarta when the JSX index fell more than 9%. It was down 7.6% by mid-afternoon. Thailand’s SET lost 4.2%. In Taiwan, the Taiex lost 4%, pulled lower by losses for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., or TSMC, the world’s largest computer chip maker. Its shares fell 3.8% on Tuesday. On Monday, the S&P 500 sagged 0.2% as shell-shocked investors watched to see what Trump will do next in his trade war. If other countries agree to trade deals, he could lower his tariffs and avoid a possible recession. But if he sticks with tariffs for the long haul, stock prices may fall further. The Dow sank 0.9%, and the Nasdaq composite edged up by 0.1%. All three indexes started the day sharply lower. But a false rumor that Trump was considering a 90-day pause on his tariffs caused the Dow and S&P 500 to shoot higher in the late morning. A White House account on X quickly labeled as “fake news” the rumor that raised hopes Trump may let up on tariffs, causing shifts in trillions of dollars of investments. Soon afterward, Trump dug in further, saying he may raise tariffs more against China after the world’s second-largest economy retaliated last week with its own set of tariffs against U.S. products. Trump’s trade war is an attack on the globalization that’s shaped today's world economy and helped bring down prices but also caused manufacturing jobs to leave for other countries. He has said he wants to bring factory jobs back to the United States, a process that could take years. Trump also says he wants to narrow trade deficits with other countries, but it's unclear how much room for negotiation there is on the U.S. side or among its trading partners. Indexes swung between losses and gains Monday, partly because investors are still hoping negotiations may forestall actual implementation of the stiff duties on all imports. All that seemed certain Monday was the financial pain hammering investments around the world. Hurt by worries that a global economy weakened by trade barriers will burn less fuel, the price of a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude oil dipped below $60 on Monday for the first time since 2021. Early Tuesday, it was up 67 cents at $61.37 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gained 65 cents to $64.86 per barrel.

The wolf pups, which range in age from three to six months old, have long white hair, muscular jaws and already weigh in at around 80 pounds — on track to reach 140 pounds at maturity, researchers at Colossal Biosciences reported Monday. Dire wolves, which went extinct more than 10,000 years old, are much larger than gray wolves, their closest living relatives today. Independent scientists said this latest effort doesn't mean dire wolves are coming back to North American grasslands any time soon. “All you can do now is make something look superficially like something else""— not fully revive extinct species, said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University at Buffalo who was not involved in the research. Colossal scientists learned about specific traits that dire wolves possessed by examining ancient DNA from fossils. The researchers studied a 13,000 year-old dire wolf tooth unearthed in Ohio and a 72,000 year-old skull fragment found in Idaho, both part of natural history museum collections. Then the scientists took blood cells from a living gray wolf and used CRISPR to genetically modify them in 20 different sites, said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro. They transferred that genetic material to an egg cell from a domestic dog. When ready, embryos were transferred to surrogates, also domestic dogs, and 62 days later the genetically engineered pups were born. Colossal has previously announced similar projects to genetically alter cells from living species to create animals resembling extinct woolly mammoths, dodos and others. Though the pups may physically resemble young dire wolves, ""what they will probably never learn is the finishing move of how to kill a giant elk or a big deer,"" because they won't have opportunities to watch and learn from wild dire wolf parents, said Colossal's chief animal care expert Matt James. Colossal also reported today that it had cloned four red wolves using blood drawn from wild wolves of the southeastern U.S.'s critically endangered red wolf population. The aim is to bring more genetic diversity into the small population of captive red wolves, which scientists are using to breed and help save the species. This technology may have broader application for conservation of other species because it's less invasive than other techniques to clone animals, said Christopher Preston, a wildlife expert at the University of Montana who was not involved in the research. But it still requires a wild wolf to be sedated for a blood draw and that's no simple feat, he added. Colossal CEO Ben Lamm said the team met with officials from the U.S. Interior Department in late March about the project. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum praised the work on X on Monday as a “thrilling new era of scientific wonder” even as outside scientists said there are limitations to restoring the past. “Whatever ecological function the dire wolf performed before it went extinct, it can’t perform those functions"" on today's existing landscapes, said Buffalo's Lynch. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

173,Federal grants to fight child labor worldwide are axed in DOGE cuts,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/federal-grants-to-fight-child-labor-worldwide-are-axed-in-doge-cuts-2025-04-07/,"NEW YORK (AP) — The Trump administrated has canceled millions of dollars in international grants that a Department of Labor division administered to combat child labor and slave labor around the world. The Bureau of International Labor Affairs helped reduce the number of child laborers worldwide by 78 million over the last two decades, including by issuing grants to international organizations, according to the Department of Labor. But billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency terminated all of ILAB’s grants, according to the DOGE website, and the grant-funded programs are being closed down, according to an email to Department of Labor employees obtained by The Associated Press. The grants went to non-profit organizations and non-governmental organizations working in other countries to promote better working conditions for the most vulnerable people and to ensure companies complied with international labor standards. The discontinued projects reached across continents and industries, according to the Labor Department website. One grant went toward helping end a practice in Uzbekistan that put farmers and children to work picking cotton against their will. Another grantee trained agriculture workers in Mexico on labor rights, aiming to end child labor in the tobacco industry. A project in West Africa helped curb the practice of 10-year-old children being sent to harvest cacao beans with machetes, according to Reid Maki, coordinator of the Child Labor Coalition, a group of organizations fighting child labor domestically and internationally. “We were on a path to eliminating the scourge (of child labor), and now, if ILAB is defunded, if the programs are closed, we’re looking at the reverse,” Maki said. “We’re looking at an explosion of child labor.” The cancellation of the grants mirrors actions the Trump administration and DOGE took in dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development, which had funding for foreign humanitarian and development work the agency administered frozen or cut. Referring to the grants as “paused,” Department of Labor spokesperson Courtney Parella said the American people elected Trump with “a clear mandate to reduce federal government bloat and root out waste.” “Americans don’t want their hard-earned tax dollars bankrolling foreign handouts that put America last,” Parella said in an emailed statement. ""We’re focused on improving oversight and accountability within this program – and across the entire department – while prioritizing investments in the American workforce and bolstering protections for children here at home.” The Bureau of International Labor Affairs researched and worked to combat modern slavery among children and adults with about $500 million in grants, according to Catherine Feingold, international director of the AFL-CIO. The labor federation worked with ILAB on strengthening global working conditions. The bureau produced annual reports tracking labor conditions and listing products that were made with child labor. American companies relied on the research to determine if there was improper labor in their supply chains, Feingold said. “You don’t want American workers competing with countries that use forced and child labor,” Feingold said. “I worry that we’re going to see more products made with child and forced labor, both in the U.S. and around the world. We’re going so far back in time here, allowing forced labor and child labor to go rampant in the global economy.” An estimated 160 million children are doing child labor, which is defined as work that can harm them or interfere with learning, and an estimated 79 million are doing child labor that is hazardous, Maki, of the Child Labor Coalition, said. The children who harvest cacao beans in West Africa, for example, haul heavy loads and are exposed to dangerous chemicals, as well as the risk of severe injuries while using machetes to break open seed pods they hold in their hands, he said. “What we see there is kids, often very young, working for often no wages at all, sometimes with families, but often not,” Maki said. The American Apparel and Footwear Association, a trade group which represents hundreds of American brands and retailers, and the Fair Labor Association, a nonprofit organization working to improve conditions in the apparel and footwear industries, called ILAB a crucial ally in fighting unfair trade and leveling the playing field for American businesses and workers. “We rely on the essential work of ILAB, whose purpose is to put America First by furthering the interests of American workers and American businesses,"" the groups said in a joint letter to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. Employees at ILAB and other divisions of the Labor Department are bracing for staff reductions. On Friday night, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer notified employees in several Labor Department offices that they were being offered the options of deferred resignation or voluntary early retirement, according to an email obtained by The Associated Press. In addition to International Labor Affairs, the notice went to employees in the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, the Women's Bureau and the Office of Public Affairs. They were told to expect additional announcements, including plans to implement a reduction in force, in the coming weeks. “You can’t do this work if you eliminate all the expertise that’s been built over the years in that team,” Reingold said. The Department of Labor spokesperson did not comment on plans to reduce the workforce.","But billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency terminated all of ILAB’s grants, according to the DOGE website, and the grant-funded programs are being closed down, according to an email to Department of Labor employees obtained by The Associated Press.","We’re going so far back in time here, allowing forced labor and child labor to go rampant in the global economy.” An estimated 160 million children are doing child labor, which is defined as work that can harm them or interfere with learning, and an estimated 79 million are doing child labor that is hazardous, Maki, of the Child Labor Coalition, said.",One grant went toward helping end a practice in Uzbekistan that put farmers and children to work picking cotton against their will.,"""We’re focused on improving oversight and accountability within this program – and across the entire department – while prioritizing investments in the American workforce and bolstering protections for children here at home.” The Bureau of International Labor Affairs researched and worked to combat modern slavery among children and adults with about $500 million in grants, according to Catherine Feingold, international director of the AFL-CIO.",positive,62.82%
174,Budget airline Avelo to fly deportation flights for ICE from Arizona,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/budget-airline-avelo-to-fly-deportation-flights-for-ice-from-arizona-2025-04-07/,"Budget carrier Avelo Airlines signed an agreement to fly federal deportation flights from Arizona starting in May, according to the company, whose founder acknowledged the decision may be controversial. Andrew Levy, also CEO of the Houston-based airline, said Avelo is flying for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration Control and Enforcement agency as part of a “long-term charter program” to support the agency's deportation efforts. The company decided the move would help with expansion and protect jobs, he said. “We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,"" Levy said in a statement. The domestic and international flights will be supported by three Boeing 737-800 planes and based at Mesa Gateway Airport, Avelo said in a statement. In an online job listing for the Arizona operation, Avelo states that the “flights will be both domestic and international trips to support DHS’s deportation efforts.” Tom Cartwright, a flight data analyst for the advocacy group Witness at the Border, whose social media feeds are closely watched in immigration circles, said he isn't aware of any other commercial airlines that have provided such flights for ICE in the past five years he's been tracking flights. He called the decision by Avelo “unusual"" considering charter companies the public likely hasn't heard of typically make these flights. “They may fly a flight with all migrants or deportation flights today and they might fly fans to the Masters golf tournament tomorrow,” he said of the charters. “They don’t sell tickets in a retail manner like Avelo does.” In New Haven, Connecticut, where Avelo flies out of Tweed New Haven Airport, Democratic Mayor Justin Elicker said he called Levy over the weekend to express his opposition to the arrangement and urged the CEO to reconsider. “Avelo Airlines’ decision to charter deportation flights from Mesa Gateway Airport in Arizona is deeply disappointing and disturbing. For a company that champions themselves as ‘New Haven’s hometown airline,’ this business decision in antithetical to New Haven’s values,” Elicker said in a statement. “Travel should be about bringing people together, not tearing families apart,” he added. A local immigrant advocacy group called the New Haven Immigrants coalition is urging people to sign an online petition pledging to boycott the airline. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ___ This story has been corrected to show the airport name is Mesa Gateway Airport.","For a company that champions themselves as ‘New Haven’s hometown airline,’ this business decision in antithetical to New Haven’s values,” Elicker said in a statement.","In an online job listing for the Arizona operation, Avelo states that the “flights will be both domestic and international trips to support DHS’s deportation efforts.” Tom Cartwright, a flight data analyst for the advocacy group Witness at the Border, whose social media feeds are closely watched in immigration circles, said he isn't aware of any other commercial airlines that have provided such flights for ICE in the past five years he's been tracking flights.",“Avelo Airlines’ decision to charter deportation flights from Mesa Gateway Airport in Arizona is deeply disappointing and disturbing.,"In an online job listing for the Arizona operation, Avelo states that the “flights will be both domestic and international trips to support DHS’s deportation efforts.” Tom Cartwright, a flight data analyst for the advocacy group Witness at the Border, whose social media feeds are closely watched in immigration circles, said he isn't aware of any other commercial airlines that have provided such flights for ICE in the past five years he's been tracking flights.",neutral,90.29%
175,Gray divorce: 10 financial and tax issues you must know after 50,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/gray-divorce-10-financial-and-tax-issues-you-must-know-after-50-2025-04-08/,"Beyond the emotional strain of a “gray divorce,” managing your finances is critical. The first step is hiring an experienced divorce attorney. Although it might be tempting to avoid legal fees, going without professional guidance could cost you more in the long run. Additionally, understanding the key financial and tax issues that come with gray divorce is essential. The cash flow you had while you were married supported one household. After a divorce, that available income stream will need to fund two households. At best, you can expect your income to be cut in half. Granted, you only have to cover your own personal expenses, but some expenses, like housing, insurance, and medical expenses, could exceed 50% of your married costs. Start with calculating a spending budget. To begin, itemize your fixed costs: things like rent, car payments, insurance, groceries, and utilities. Your variable expenses, such as travel, restaurants, and gifts, can be adjusted based on your available income. As your post divorce lifestyle becomes more certain, you can revise that budget. After a late-life divorce, you might be thinking that you’d like to keep the family home. This could be a double-edged sword. Keeping all the equity in the house means you’ll get less of the other assets. Also, the cost of maintaining a large home along with assuming a mortgage could squeeze your budget. Do you really want to be house-poor to keep a residence that might be too big for you? If you were married at least 10 years, your Social Security benefit will be the greater of your own benefit or half your ex-spouse’s benefit. Certainly, if this makes a difference for you, consider the timing of your gray divorce. For example, if you’ve been married for nine and a half years, you might want to delay the final decree for six months. Additionally, if you are approaching age 62 (or older), you have a choice of taking benefits early for less of an ongoing monthly benefit or delaying to increase your monthly benefit. Your personal financial situation and life expectancy will be the primary decision-making factors. If you will be short on cash flow , returning to (or continuing) work might be a good solution. Depending on your shortfall, it might not be necessary to hold down a high-level full-time job. Many semiretired people supplement their income with substitute teaching, house- and dog-sitting, and other part-time work. Whether you continue your regular job or pursue something less demanding, there’s a big advantage to bringing in income: You might be able to delay drawing from your investments. When you are on your own, long-term-care coverage is important. This insurance will be less expensive and easier to obtain when you are younger (under age 60) and healthy. If you’re not able to afford premiums, consider opting for a longer waiting period of 180 or 360 days. Paying for long-term care for six months to a year can be more easily handled than having to cover care for many years. There are two other options for covering long-term-care costs. One, you may able to exchange a life insurance policy for a long-term-care policy. Second, consider moving into a “continuing care” retirement community. You can choose independent living, which is similar to having your own apartment. As you age and require more care, you can move to assisted living, healthcare, or memory-care facilities within the community. ___ This article was provided to The Associated Press by Morningstar.

176,"Chevron to survey east Mediterranean seabed for pipeline linking gas field to Egypt, Cyprus says",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/chevron-to-survey-east-mediterranean-seabed-for-pipeline-linking-gas-field-to-egypt-cyprus-says-2025-04-07/,"NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Energy company Chevron will begin a survey of the east Mediterranean seabed early this summer to prepare for a pipeline connecting a sizable natural gas deposit in Cyprus waters with processing facilities in Egypt, Cypriot officials said Monday. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth told Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides in a meeting at Chevron headquarters in Houston the survey will proceed according to a set timetable. No further details were disclosed in a statement issued by Cypriot government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis. The pipeline will link Cyprus’ Aphrodite field -- estimated to contain up to 4.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas -– with an undisclosed facility on Egypt’s coastline. Christodoulides was in Houston as part of a weeklong trip to the U.S. to solicit investment in the east Mediterranean island nation. Chevron and partners Shell and Israeli NewMed Energy are in charge of developing Aphrodite, which was discovered in 2011 some 160 km (100 miles) off Cyprus’ southern coastline, within the island’s exclusive economic zone. In February, Chevron, NewMed and Shell signed an agreement with Egypt outlining the framework under which Aphrodite will be developed. The agreement came after the Cypriot government and the Chevron-led consortium approved a revised production plan that includes a floating platform to process extracted gas as well as the pipeline to Egypt. Christodoulides told Wirth that Aphrodite’s development is a priority for the Cypriot government “as it highlights the importance of our country as a new source of supply for the needs of neighboring countries but also the European Union,” the statement said. Chevron officials said Aphrodite is an “important part of the energy company’s portfolio of activities in the eastern Mediterranean, a region that is part of Chevron’s future plans and priorities,” it said. Chevron is the only energy company that operates in Cyprus, Israel, Egypt and Greece. ExxonMobil and partner Qatar Petroleum hold exploration licenses for two blocks where they have discovered at least one sizable gas field and are currently drilling a second. A consortium made up of Italy’s Eni and French Total holds exploration licenses for four blocks and have discovered the Cronos deposit, estimated to hold more than 3 trillion cubic feet of gas. In November, Cyprus Energy Minister George Papanastasiou said that ExxonMobil, Eni and Total could partner up to jointly develop gas deposits in close proximity to each other.

178,Weedkiller maker asks US Supreme Court to block lawsuits claiming it failed to warn about cancer,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/weedkiller-maker-asks-us-supreme-court-to-block-lawsuits-claiming-it-failed-to-warn-about-cancer-2025-04-07/,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Global agrochemical manufacturer Bayer has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to decide whether federal law preempts thousands of state lawsuits alleging it failed to warn people that its popular weedkiller could cause cancer. Bayer's new request to the nation's highest court comes as it is simultaneously pursing legislation in several states seeking to erect a legal shield against lawsuits targeting Roundup, a commonly used weedkiller for both farms and homes. Bayer disputes the cancer claims but has set aside $16 billion to settle cases and asserted Monday that the future of American agriculture is at stake. In a court filing Friday, Bayer urged the Supreme Court to take up a Missouri case that awarded $1.25 million to a man who developed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma after spraying Roundup on a community garden in St. Louis. The federally approved label for Roundup includes no warning of cancer. Bayer contends federal pesticide laws preempt states from adopting additional labeling for products and thus prohibits failure-to-warn lawsuits brought under state laws. The Supreme Court in 2022 declined to hear a similar claim from Bayer in a California case that awarded more than $86 million to a married couple. But Germany-based Bayer, which acquired Roundup maker Monsanto in 2018, contends the Supreme Court should intervene now because lower courts have issued conflicting rulings. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Bayer's favor last year while the 9th and 11th Circuits have ruled against its stance. An attorney representing the St. Louis gardener said Bayer is “really grasping at straws."" “The reality is they don’t want to put the warning on it because they’re afraid"" that if people ""realize it’s unsafe, it will reduce sales,” said attorney Jim Onder, whose firm has more than 20,000 clients with failure-to-warn claims regarding Roundup. Bayer faces about 181,000 Roundup claims, mostly from residential users. Because of that, Bayer stopped using the key ingredient glyphosate in Roundup sold in the U.S. residential lawn and garden market. But glyphosate remains in agricultural products. It's designed to be used with genetically modified seeds that can resist the weedkiller’s deadly effect, thus allowing farmers to produce more while conserving the soil by tilling it less. Bayer has said it might have to consider pulling glyphosate from U.S. agricultural markets if the lawsuits persist. “This is a bigger threat to innovation in general, when we think about agriculture,"" said Jess Christiansen, head of communications for Bayer’s crop science division. ""If glyphosate falls to the litigation industry, what could be next?” Bayer has made similar arguments to lawmakers in several states. Georgia recently became the first to pass legislation backed by Bayer that would deem federally approved pesticide labels sufficient to satisfy any state-law duty to warn customers. Gov. Brian Kemp has not indicated whether he will sign the bill. A jury in Georgia recently ordered Bayer to pay nearly $2.1 billion to a man who claimed Roundup caused his non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Legislation barring similar state failure-to-warn claims for pesticide makers passed the Tennessee Senate on Thursday and the North Dakota House earlier this year and is now pending in the second chamber in each state. Bayer also has focused heavily on Missouri and Iowa, home respectively to its North America crop science division and a Roundup manufacturing facility. The Republican-led Missouri House narrowly passed the legislation in February. But a coalition of Republican senators has vowed to block it. State Sen. Nick Schroer has said it “would be a betrayal to the public trust” and the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial to grant “immunity” to pesticide manufacturers against particular legal claims. Similar legislation advanced through the Iowa Senate this year with exclusively Republican support. But the Iowa House declined to bring the bill forward before last week’s legislative deadline. Iowa House Speaker Pat Grassley told reporters Thursday “there’s not support” within the Republican House caucus at this time. The bill drew staunch opposition from environmental justice groups that denounced it as a “cancer gag act,” saying it would limit the rights of Iowans to hold pesticide companies accountable if their products cause harm. During a February protest at the Iowa capitol building, speakers took turns telling stories of family members throughout the state who have been diagnosed with cancers. ___ Associated Press writer Hannah Fingerhut contributed from Des Moines, Iowa.",Legislation barring similar state failure-to-warn claims for pesticide makers passed the Tennessee Senate on Thursday and the North Dakota House earlier this year and is now pending in the second chamber in each state.,"In a court filing Friday, Bayer urged the Supreme Court to take up a Missouri case that awarded $1.25 million to a man who developed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma after spraying Roundup on a community garden in St. Louis.","“This is a bigger threat to innovation in general, when we think about agriculture,"" said Jess Christiansen, head of communications for Bayer’s crop science division.",State Sen.

180,Will the tariffs lead to a recession? Here's how to know if we're in one,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/will-the-tariffs-lead-to-a-recession-heres-how-to-know-if-were-in-one-2025-04-07/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's sharp tariff hikes last week have sent the stock market into a tailspin, raised alarm bells among Wall Street executives, and heightened many economists' worries that the U.S. could tip into recession. The tariffs, set to take effect Wednesday, include a 10% blanket duty on nearly all countries and additional import taxes on 60 nations. The increases are so large and are taking effect so rapidly that they are likely to be disruptive to the economy, economists say, even if they are partially rolled back through negotiations in the coming weeks or months. Economists at Goldman Sachs have raised their assessment of the odds the U.S. will experience a recession — where the economy shrinks and unemployment rises — to 45%, from 35% last week. And even that forecast assumes many of the duties are negotiated away or reduced. If not, “we expect to change our forecast to a recession,” Jan Hatzius, Goldman's chief economist, and his colleagues said in an analyst note. Other economists are raising similar alarms, with JPMorgan putting the odds of a recession at 60% and projecting inflation will reach 4.4% by the end of this year, up from 2.8% currently. Should the tariffs remain in place for an extended period, they will likely raise costs and uncertainty for businesses, which could reduce their willingness to hire, invest in new equipment or software, or expand into new markets. Americans could cut back on their spending in the face of higher prices. The economy could start to shrink, after expanding 2.8% in 2024. So far, most measures of the economy, such as job gains, remain solid. Employers added more jobs than expected in March, the government reported last week, and layoffs remain historically low. Still, surveys show consumers and businesses are increasingly worried about the economic outlook. What everyone from Wall Street investors to economists to officials at the Federal Reserve will be watching closely is whether those concerns lead to a downturn. Here are some questions and answers about recessions: Not yet. But one development that has sparked widespread fear is a real-time economy tracker maintained by the Federal Reserve's Atlanta branch. It now indicates that the economy could shrink by 0.8% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from 2.4% in last year's final quarter. The Atlanta Fed's tracker is not technically a forecast but instead a running tally that is updated as economic data is released. Typically, a recession occurs when some short of shock hits the economy, such as the pandemic in 2020, or the bursting of the housing bubble in 2007. It's not yet clear that tariffs will have a large enough impact to knock the economy into reverse. But economists at Wells Fargo, in a note on Friday, calculated that the average U.S. tariff would jump tenfold to about 23% when all the duties are in place, the highest since 1908. Such a shift “practically overnight will throw sand in the gears of global supply chains in ways that we have not seen since the pandemic and perhaps since World War II,” Shannon Grein, an economist at Wells Fargo, wrote. On Sunday, Trump told reporters that “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something."" Yet Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on the same day said “there doesn't have to be a recession” and that the administration is focused on “building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity.” The clearest signal would be a steady rise in job losses and a surge in unemployment. The government's weekly report on the number of people seeking unemployment benefits, which is released every Thursday, is being closely watched for signs of rising layoffs. So far, applications for aid remain quite low by historical standards. Torsten Slok, chief economist for Apollo, an asset management firm, is watching a range of real-time data and sees some signs the economy is weakening. The number of people filing for bankruptcy has risen, while visits to Las Vegas have declined a bit. Weekly visits to movie theaters this year are below their levels in recent years, he said. The Trump administration is plowing ahead with widespread job cuts in federal agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, and says it will cut government spending. Both could weigh on the economy, at least in the short run. And even if some of the tariffs imposed April 2 are pulled back or reduced, the uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's trade policies are likely to discourage spending by businesses or consumers. It's unclear, for example, whether companies will build more factories in the U.S. — as the tariffs are intended to encourage — if they don't know how long the tariffs will last. Another factor could be overseas boycotts of U.S. goods and travel. Slok has noted that airline bookings data point to a 70% drop in trips from Canada to the U.S. in the next six months. While the effect on the overall economy is likely to be minor, Goldman Sachs estimates such changes could shave 0.2 percentage points off growth this year. Many economists now expect the Fed will cut their key interest rate at their meeting in June and implement at least three reductions this year. But the Fed is in a difficult position: With inflation seemingly stuck above its target of 2%, even before the tariffs take effect, the central bank would typically want to keep borrowing costs high to slow spending and cool inflation. Yet if tariffs weaken the economy and lead to job losses, the Fed would normally slash its key rate to stimulate borrowing and spending. Since tariffs could worsen inflation, however, it is unlikely to do so until there are clear signs of a sharp economic slowdown. “They can’t really be proactive here because they do have inflation to worry about,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities. “What we’re looking at is a Fed that is going to be stuck between a rock and a hard place."" On Friday, Chair Jerome Powell said the tariffs could worsen inflation and added that the Fed's main obligation was to keep prices in check. His comments suggested the Fed will likely stay on the sidelines at its next meeting in May. Recessions are officially declared by the obscure-sounding National Bureau of Economic Research, a group of economists whose Business Cycle Dating Committee defines a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.” The committee considers trends in hiring. It also assesses many other data points, including gauges of income, employment, inflation-adjusted spending, retail sales and factory output. It assigns heavy weight to a measure of inflation-adjusted income that excludes government support payments like Social Security. Yet the organization typically doesn’t declare a recession until well after one has begun, sometimes as long as a year afterward.

182,Microsoft workers say they've been fired after 50th anniversary protest over Israel contract,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/microsoft-workers-say-theyve-been-fired-after-50th-anniversary-protest-over-israel-contract-2025-04-07/,"Microsoft has fired two employees who interrupted the company's 50th anniversary celebration to protest its work supplying artificial intelligence technology to the Israeli military, according to a group representing the workers. Microsoft accused one of the workers in a termination letter Monday of misconduct ""designed to gain notoriety and cause maximum disruption to this highly anticipated event.” Microsoft says the other worker had already announced her resignation, but on Monday it ordered her to leave five days early. The protests began Friday when Microsoft software engineer Ibtihal Aboussad walked up toward a stage where an executive was announcing new product features and a long-term vision for Microsoft's AI ambitions. “You claim that you care about using AI for good but Microsoft sells AI weapons to the Israeli military,"" Aboussad shouted at Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman. ""Fifty-thousand people have died and Microsoft powers this genocide in our region.” The protest forced Suleyman to pause his talk while it was being livestreamed from Microsoft's campus in Redmond, Washington. Among the participants at the 50th anniversary of Microsoft's founding were co-founder Bill Gates and former CEO Steve Ballmer. Microsoft said Suleyman calmly tried to de-escalate the situation. “Thank you for your protest, I hear you,” he said. Aboussad continued, shouting that Suleyman and “all of Microsoft” had blood on their hands. She also threw onto the stage a keffiyeh scarf, which has become a symbol of support for Palestinian people, before being escorted out of the event. A second protester, Microsoft employee Vaniya Agrawal, interrupted a later part of the event. Aboussad, based at Microsoft's Canadian headquarters in Toronto, was invited on Monday to a video call with a human resources representative at which she was told she was being fired immediately, according to the advocacy group No Azure for Apartheid, which has protested the sale of Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing platform to Israel. An investigation by The Associated Press revealed earlier this year that AI models from Microsoft and OpenAI had been used as part of an Israeli military program to select bombing targets during the recent wars in Gaza and Lebanon. The story also contained details of an errant Israeli airstrike in 2023 that struck a vehicle carrying members of a Lebanese family, killing three young girls and their grandmother. In its termination letter, Microsoft told Aboussad she could have raised her concerns confidentially to a manager. Instead, it said she made “hostile, unprovoked, and highly inappropriate accusations” against Suleyman and the company and that her “conduct was so aggressive and disruptive that you had to be escorted out of the room by security.” Agrawal had already given her two weeks notice and was preparing to leave the company on April 11, but on Monday a manager emailed that Microsoft ""has decided to make your resignation immediately effective today.” It was the most public but not the first protest over Microsoft's work with Israel. In February, five Microsoft employees were ejected from a meeting with CEO Satya Nadella for protesting the contracts. “We provide many avenues for all voices to be heard,” said a statement from the company Friday. “Importantly, we ask that this be done in a way that does not cause a business disruption. If that happens, we ask participants to relocate. We are committed to ensuring our business practices uphold the highest standards.” Microsoft had declined to say Friday whether it was taking further action, but Aboussad and Agrawal expected it was coming after both lost access to their work accounts shortly after the protest. Dozens of Google workers were fired last year after internal protests over a contract it also has with the Israeli government. Employee sit-ins at Google offices in New York and Sunnyvale, California targeted a $1.2 billion deal known as Project Nimbus providing AI technology to the Israeli government. The Google workers later filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board in an attempt to get their jobs back.","Instead, it said she made “hostile, unprovoked, and highly inappropriate accusations” against Suleyman and the company and that her “conduct was so aggressive and disruptive that you had to be escorted out of the room by security.” Agrawal had already given her two weeks notice and was preparing to leave the company on April 11, but on Monday a manager emailed that Microsoft ""has decided to make your resignation immediately effective today.” It was the most public but not the first protest over Microsoft's work with Israel.","Instead, it said she made “hostile, unprovoked, and highly inappropriate accusations” against Suleyman and the company and that her “conduct was so aggressive and disruptive that you had to be escorted out of the room by security.” Agrawal had already given her two weeks notice and was preparing to leave the company on April 11, but on Monday a manager emailed that Microsoft ""has decided to make your resignation immediately effective today.” It was the most public but not the first protest over Microsoft's work with Israel.","Employee sit-ins at Google offices in New York and Sunnyvale, California targeted a $1.2 billion deal known as Project Nimbus providing AI technology to the Israeli government.","Instead, it said she made “hostile, unprovoked, and highly inappropriate accusations” against Suleyman and the company and that her “conduct was so aggressive and disruptive that you had to be escorted out of the room by security.” Agrawal had already given her two weeks notice and was preparing to leave the company on April 11, but on Monday a manager emailed that Microsoft ""has decided to make your resignation immediately effective today.” It was the most public but not the first protest over Microsoft's work with Israel.",negative,91.04%
183,'Doing This for Scale': All 'The White Lotus' Actors Get Paid the Same Flat Rate,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/doing-this-for-scale-all-the-white-lotus-actors-get-paid-the-same-flat-rate-2025-04-07/,"If you're an actor hoping to be a main cast member on the next season of HBO's hit ""The White Lotus,"" there are two things you can expect: your character might die, but you'll still be paid the same as the rest of your colleagues. ""Everyone is treated the same on 'The White Lotus,'"" producer David Bernad told The Hollywood Reporter last week. Veteran actors like Jason Isaacs, Parker Posey, Carrie Coon, and Michelle Monaghan were paid around $40,000 an episode ($320,000 for an eight-episode season), the same amount as the less experienced actors on set.

Although it was Lalisa Manoban's first major acting role, the superstar Thai rapper and singer, who's known as Lisa from Blackpink, is reportedly worth $25 million and has over 100 million Instagram followers. ""They get paid the same, and we do alphabetical billing, so you're getting people who want to do the project for the right reasons, not to quote The Bachelor,"" Bernad said. ""It's a system we developed in the first season because there was no money to make the show."" The outlet also noted that acclaimed actor Woody Harrelson asked the CEO of HBO's parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery, ""to see if his salary could be negotiated"" when he was up for a lead role in the series, but was told no. (He took the job anyway but reportedly left the project due to scheduling conflicts and was replaced by Walton Goggins.) ""It makes it so much easier,"" said casting director Meredith Tucker to the Hollywood Reporter. ""You tell people this is what it is. And some won't do it, and honestly, you can't hold it against people who need to make a living. Our series regulars are pretty much doing this for scale.""

186,Options Activity Points to More Volatility for Palantir Stock,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/options-activity-points-to-more-volatility-for-palantir-stock/,"Palantir Technologies NASDAQ: PLTR is becoming the stock that just won’t listen to reason. After falling about 15% and even more in after-hours and pre-market trading, PLTR stock came roaring back on April 7, with trading on the stock activating a limit up/limit down (LULD) pause. Many investors are wrestling with the question, ""Why?"" There could be many answers, but one place to look for clarity could be the company’s options chain, which suggests that a volatile stock like Palantir is still the target of options traders. PLTR stock is seeing a high volume of options activity for the week ending April 11. Calls outnumber puts, with the $80 strike showing the highest call volume and the $60 strike leading in put volume. However, the general belief based on the option chain is that the stock will land somewhere in the $70 to $80 range. At the high end, that’s about a 10% gain from the week ending April 4. This suggests that options traders believe the bottom could be in for Palantir stock. Monday morning’s trading action supports that view, as PLTR stock triggered a limit up/limit down pause due to heavy buying after dipping below $70 per share. The key concern about Palantir stock is its lofty valuation. Even after the recent sell-off, PLTR still trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 246x, and its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio sits around 62x. That’s down from a peak of over 100x in early February, but it remains well above typical valuation metrics. Much of this concern stems from comparing Palantir to traditional software stocks. However, Palantir doesn’t fit neatly into any one category. It’s not purely a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company, nor is it exclusively a cloud or artificial intelligence (AI) provider. Instead, it blends elements of each, operating as a category of its own. The company’s real differentiator is its ontology — what it calls “the operational layer for the organization.” Sitting on top of a company's digital assets, the ontology acts as a digital twin, enabling large language models (LLMs) to deliver highly relevant, actionable insights. This unique architecture sets Palantir apart and strengthens the bullish case, even at a premium valuation. The simplest reason why Palantir, along with many technology stocks, are falling harder than other stocks is simply because that’s where the money is. If institutional investors need to raise cash quickly, they will look at stocks that have delivered the strongest gains. And one of those is Palantir. That doesn’t mean that Palantir isn’t overvalued. It also doesn’t mean the company has a clear and present risk to its business. Nevertheless, if markets remain under pressure, there’s ample reason to believe that PLTR stock may have further to fall. Palantir stock doesn’t come with a tariff risk, but it still carries risk that goes beyond a lofty valuation. The risk that’s garnered the most headlines recently is that the company’s business with the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) may be at risk. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has commented that a software program was among the budget cuts. Many investors are thinking of Palantir. On the other hand, the company has entered into partnerships with Archer Aviation Inc. NYSE: ACHR and Anduril, which positions it to handle the demands of modern warfare. That’s why investors shorting or considering shorting PLTR stock based on lower U.S. government revenue may be missing the bigger picture. Retail investors have successfully capitalized on this narrative before.
