The shares of the Tata Group company were trading at Rs 5,440 apiece. Trent Ltd, which operates the apparel stores Zudio and Westside, reported a net profit of Rs 423 crore for the April-June quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a 24 percent on-year rise from the Rs 342 crore net profit reported in the year-ago period. The Tata Group company's revenue from operations meanwhile rose 20 percent on-year to Rs 4,781 crore in Q1 FY26, as against Rs 3,992 crore in Q1 FY25. The consolidated profit rose 9 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 429.7 crore, excluding the exceptional items impact. The Operating EBIT margin for Q1 FY26 stood at 11.4 percent, as against 10.6 percent in Q1 FY25. Should you buy, sell or hold? Motilal Oswal retained its 'Buy' rating on the stock, but reduced its target price to Rs 6,400 apiece. This implies an upside potential of around 19.5 percent from the stock's previous closing price of Rs 5,356 apiece. The domestic brokerage noted that the company delivered a strong EBITDA growth of approximately 37 percent on-year, beating its estimate by around 17 percent, despite a continued deceleration in revenue growth and sharp decline in gross margin. ""The significant margin beat was led by effective cost control—employee expenses fell 7% YoY, while rental costs rose only 7% YoY, despite a 36% increase in retail area, reflecting the strength of Trent’s variable cost structure,"" Motilal Oswal said, while noting that its Star business underperformed with just 7 percent on-year revenue growth, flat like-for-like sales, and a 14 percent on-year drop in revenue per square feet. ""We continue to like Trent for its robust footprint additions, strong double digit growth, long runway for growth in Star (presence in just 10 cities), and potential scale-up of emerging categories (Beauty, Innerwear, Footwear, and LGDs). However, revenue growth acceleration remains a key trigger,"" it added. Bernstein has an 'Outperform' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 6,500 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 21 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage however, also highlighted the slowing growth in revenue and significant reduction in revenue per square feet, CNBC-TV18 reported. Citi kept an 'Buy' rating on the stock, but reduced its target price to Rs 7,150 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 33 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage noted that while the revenue growth slowed down, it is still ahead of the other discretionary players, according to the note cited by the business channel. Nuvama Institutional Equities maintained its 'Hold' rating on the stock, but reduced its target price to Rs 5,850 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 9 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The brokerage said that the Tata Group company delivered strong margin improvement despite lower productivity. Trent share price history: The shares of the company later pared some gains to trade nearly 1 percent higher at Rs 5,396.50 apiece. The stock has gained nearly 8 percent in the past five days, but dropped nearly 2 percent in the past one month. It currently has a P/E ratio of around 125.

"Sensex falls for third straight day, Nifty below 24,550 as Trump threatens additional 25% tariff",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-falls-for-third-straight-day-nifty-below-24-550-as-trump-threatens-additional-25-tariff-13410906.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex slipped for a third session in a row on August 7 after US President Donald Trump announced plans to double tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent. However, markets may find some temporary relief as the fresh 25 percent levy comes with a 21-day window, giving India a brief opportunity to negotiate a trade deal. At about 9:25 am, the Sensex was down 209.33 points or 0.26 percent at 80,334.66, and the Nifty was down 64.15 points or 0.26 percent at 24,510.05. About 910 shares advanced, 1793 shares declined, and 122 shares were unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates ""The 21-day window before the additional 25 percent US tariff takes effect offers India a chance to negotiate and potentially strike a deal. However, the broader trade outlook remains clouded by uncertainty, with little clarity on how far either side is willing to compromise. President Trump, buoyed by recent trade wins with other partners like the EU, is unlikely to back down from his hardline — and arguably unjustified — stance."" V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited, said. ""For India, the challenge is greater, as the US holds the upper hand in negotiations. So far, India’s response has been measured and pragmatic. While markets are unlikely to panic immediately, sentiment is expected to remain weak in the near term amid lingering trade tensions."" he added. Among individual stocks, Bajaj Auto slipped as much as 4 percent on August 7 after the company reported a 14 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 2,210.44 crore for the fiscal first quarter of FY26. Revenue from operations climbed to Rs 13,133.35 crore in Q1 FY26, marking a 10 percent increase from the same quarter last year. Bernstein and CLSA have given outperform rating on the counter. Shares of lifestyle retailer Trent rose 1 percent after the company reported a 9 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in consolidated net profit to Rs 425 crore for Q1FY26, compared to Rs 391 crore in the same quarter last year. Revenue rose 19 percent YoY to Rs 4,883 crore from Rs 4,104 crore. Domestic brokerages Motilal Oswal and Avendus Spark have given buy ratings. Two-wheeler major Hero MotoCorp rose nearly 2 percent after it reported a flat net profit at Rs 1,126 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 as against Rs 1,123 crore a year ago. However, the firm beat estimates as a Moneycontrol poll of eight brokerage firms pegged the net profit at Rs 1,054 crore. Hero's revenue declined 5.5 percent to Rs 9,579 crore in Q1FY26 as against Rs 10,144 crore in Q1FY25. Technical View The Nifty continues to trade within a tightly knit consolidation range of 24,500–24,750, as evidenced by successive small-bodied candles on the daily chart. A directional breakout from this band will likely dictate the next phase of market momentum. Until then, the Nifty may continue its sideways to choppy trajectory. The 100-day exponential moving average (100-DEMA), currently near 24,595, has consistently acted as a support threshold. However, a decisive breakdown below the 24,535–24,500 zone could trigger further downside toward 24,300–24,250. On the upside, immediate resistance is seen around 24,760, coinciding with the 10-DEMA. Unless the index convincingly reclaims this level, any rebound is expected to encounter selling pressure. Hero MotoCorp, Trent, Cipla, Bajaj Finserv, and Tech Mahindra were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Tata Motors, Kotak Mahindra, Jio Financial Services, Coal India, and Tata Steel.

"Sensex, Nifty set to drop for third day as Trump’s additional 25% tariff rattles sentiment",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-set-to-drop-for-third-day-as-trump-s-additional-25-tariff-rattles-sentiment-13409534.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex are poised to extend losses for a third straight session after US President Donald Trump announced plans to double tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent. However, markets may find some temporary relief as the fresh 25 percent levy comes with a 21-day window, giving India a brief opportunity to negotiate a trade deal. At about 7:45 pm, the Gift Nifty was at 24,552, lower by 0.32 percent. After a choppy intraday session, bears drove Dalal Street into the red on August 6, as the Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee's decision failed to support the benchmark indices. Further, investors decided to trim exposure to the equity markets as U.S. President Trump's repeated tariff threats roiled sentiment. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) were net sellers to the tune of Rs 4,999 crore worth of shares in Indian equities, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) net bought Rs 6,794 crore worth of shares, according to provisional NSE data. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session The Nifty continues to trade within a tightly knit consolidation range of 24,500–24,750, as evidenced by successive small-bodied candles on the daily chart. A directional breakout from this band will likely dictate the next phase of market momentum. Until then, the Nifty may continue its sideways to choppy trajectory. The 100-day exponential moving average (100-DEMA), currently near 24,595, has consistently acted as a support threshold. However, a decisive breakdown below the 24,535–24,500 zone could trigger further downside toward 24,300–24,250. On the upside, immediate resistance is seen around 24,760, coinciding with the 10-DEMA. Unless the index convincingly reclaims this level, any rebound is expected to encounter selling pressure. Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities says that the Nifty Bank index is yet to stage a meaningful breakout, despite a Bullish Harami pattern forming on the daily chart. A reversal will only be confirmed if it closes above 55,700. Minor upticks continue to face selling pressure, keeping the trend weak. The index remains stretched below its short-term averages, with the 10-day EMA near 55,900 and the 20-day EMA around 56,200 acting as key resistance. On the downside, support lies at 55,100–55,000. A breach below this could trigger further selling toward 54,500–54,300, he added. India VIX rose marginally by 2.11 percent to close at 11.96. Despite upcoming macro triggers, volatility remains subdued and anchored near the 11 mark—suggesting that the broader market is currently pricing in consolidation rather than a steep correction. This implies that while caution prevails, panic has not yet taken hold. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) has sharply declined from 0.72 to 0.60, highlighting growing bearish sentiment and a clear dominance of call sellers.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade IndiGo, Asian Paints, Waaree Energies, Jindal Stainless, CSB Bank, Bajaj Finance and others on August 7?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-indigo-asian-paints-waaree-energies-jindal-stainless-csb-bank-bajaj-finance-and-others-on-august-7-13409033.html,"The benchmark indices remained under pressure for the second consecutive session, with the Nifty 50 down 0.3 percent on August 7. Bears maintained dominance in market breadth, with about 1,988 shares declining compared to 697 advancing on the NSE. The bearish sentiment is expected to prevail, given the weakness in technical indicators. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Nilesh Jain, Head – Technical and Derivatives Research Analyst (Equity Research) at Centrum Broking InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo) | CMP: Rs 5,893.5 InterGlobe Aviation remains in a strong uptrend, consistently taking support at its 50-DMA (currently at Rs 5,681) and along its rising trendline. It is on the verge of a breakout from a falling channel pattern, and a successful breakout could trigger a fresh rally towards new all-time highs. We expect the stock to surpass resistance and head towards the Rs 6,300 level in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,300 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,680 Asian Paints | CMP: Rs 2,491.2 Asian Paints is forming a strong base and is on the verge of a multi-month breakout above the Rs 2,530 level. It is trading comfortably above all key short-term and long-term moving averages. Additionally, momentum indicators and oscillators on the daily chart have confirmed a bullish crossover. Based on this setup, we anticipate the stock to move towards the gap area near Rs 2,700 in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,700 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,390 Sun Pharmaceutical Industries | CMP: Rs 1,595.2 Sun Pharmaceutical has broken down from a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart, signaling potential downside. Additionally, the MACD has triggered a sell crossover, reinforcing the bearish outlook. It is currently trading well below all key short-term and long-term moving averages. Given these factors, further weakness is likely in the near term, and a sell-on-rise approach is advisable. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 1,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,649 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities Waaree Energies | CMP: Rs 3,218.4 Waaree Energies has recently found strong support near its 50-day EMA, which acted as a springboard for a fresh upward move. Following this rebound, the price action has been gradually inching higher and is now approaching a critical juncture — a potential breakout above a downward-sloping trendline on the daily chart. Notably, Wednesday’s trading session witnessed volume activity that surpassed the 50-day average, indicating early signs of accumulation. This surge in participation suggests that market participants may be positioning themselves ahead of a possible breakout, adding conviction to the bullish setup. From a trend perspective, the stock is trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages, which are aligned in a bullish sequence and trending upward — a classic sign of strength and trend continuation. This confluence of price, volume, and momentum indicators points toward a constructive technical structure, with the potential for a breakout-led rally in the near term. Hence, we recommend buying this stock above the breakout level of Rs 3,270. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,520 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,140 Jindal Stainless | CMP: Rs 734 Jindal Stainless has recently witnessed a breakout from a downward-sloping trendline on the daily chart, signalling a potential continuation of its upward trajectory. Post-breakout, the price has been gradually trending higher, supported by relatively higher volumes — a classic indication of sustained buying interest and accumulation. Currently, the stock is trading above its key moving averages, which reinforces the bullish undertone. Momentum indicators are also aligning with the bullish narrative. The RSI is firmly positioned in the bullish zone and continues to rise, reflecting improving price strength. Meanwhile, the MACD remains in positive territory, quoting above both its signal line and the zero line. The MACD histogram is expanding, suggesting a pickup in upside momentum and further validating the breakout. Overall, the confluence of price action, volume behaviour, and momentum indicators points to a strong technical setup, with potential for continued upward movement in the sessions ahead. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the Rs 730–740 range. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 800 Stop-Loss: Rs 700 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities CSB Bank | CMP: Rs 435.2 CSB Bank has recently given a strong closing above its key resistance zone of Rs 420, supported by a bullish RSI crossover, indicating strengthening momentum. The major trend remains positive, with a structure of higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart and a steady rally visible on the weekly chart. It is also sustaining above its 20-day EMA, reinforcing the bullish sentiment. With a favourable risk-reward setup, the stock can be considered for buying at Rs 434. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 465 Stop-Loss: Rs 417 Bajaj Finance | CMP: Rs 876.65 Bajaj Finance has given a consolidation breakdown on the daily chart, indicating a shift towards weakness. It is trading below its crucial 20-day and 50-day EMAs, reflecting sustained selling pressure. On Wednesday, the stock faced rejection near its 100-day EMA, placed at Rs 893, further reinforcing the bearish sentiment. Additionally, the RSI remains in a bearish crossover, suggesting weak momentum. Based on these technical signals, the stock is expected to drift lower and test its 200-day EMA, placed around the Rs 845 level, in the near term. We recommend selling August Futures in the Rs 883–880 range. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 864 Stop-Loss: Rs 896 Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders | CMP: Rs 2,764.5 Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders witnessed a sharp downward move on the daily chart after breaking its key support level of Rs 3,104, signaling strong bearish momentum. During a pullback, it faced resistance near the 20-day EMA and closed with a bearish engulfing pattern, reinforcing the negative sentiment. These technical indicators suggest the stock may head toward its 200-day EMA. Traders can consider initiating a sell position (August Futures) in the Rs 2,760–2,780 range. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 2,660 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,825 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Bajaj Auto warns of demand, supply challenges from ABS mandate on entry-level bikes",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/bajaj-auto-warns-of-demand-supply-challenges-from-abs-mandate-on-entry-level-bikes-13406185.html,"Bajaj Auto has flagged supply chain and cost hurdles stemming from the government’s proposal to make anti-lock braking systems (ABS) mandatory for all two-wheelers from January 1, 2026. The regulation, aimed at enhancing road safety, is expected to particularly impact motorcycles in the 100–125cc segment, which currently use the more affordable combined braking system (CBS). Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director at Bajaj Auto, said the transition would put “huge requirements” on the supply chain. “It could take anywhere between 12 to 24 months to get the supply chain ready if every single two-wheeler has to be equipped with ABS,” Sharma said during the company’s post-earnings call for the first quarter on August 6. Also read: Bajaj Auto halves EV output amid rare earth crunch, races to secure alternative supplies While acknowledging the need for improved rider safety, Sharma warned that the cost implications of such a shift could weigh on consumer sentiment. “We struggle to cut even Rs 500 from the cost. If prices go up sharply due to ABS, it will dampen demand—especially in the entry-level segment,” he said. Sharma pointed out that the Indian two-wheeler industry has yet to recover to its FY19 peak levels, with one of the key reasons being successive cost escalations triggered by regulatory changes, insurance costs, and other compliance burdens. The proposed ABS mandate, he noted, risks repeating that cycle at a time when rural and value-conscious buyers are still cautious. However, there appears to be room for negotiation. Sharma said the government is in active dialogue with industry players and has asked for additional data to evaluate alternatives. “They are open to understanding other options that may be more cost-effective and still improve safety. Those conversations are ongoing,” he added. The auto sector is already navigating multiple challenges, including a supply crunch of heavy rare earth magnets used in electric vehicles. Any further regulatory burden, especially on the cost-sensitive end of the market, could deepen headwinds. Read more: Modi to visit China: Trump’s tariff war bringing rivals together?

"Bajaj Auto halves EV output amid rare earth crunch, races to secure alternative supplies",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/bajaj-auto-halves-ev-output-amid-rare-earth-crunch-races-to-secure-alternative-supplies-13405296.html,"Bajaj Auto has slashed production of its electric two-wheelers by up to 50 percent in July as a deepening global shortage of heavy rare earth magnets disrupts supply chains. The automaker expects output to remain constrained in the coming months, with August and September also likely to see production at just over half the planned levels, Bajaj Auto said in its post-earnings conference call on August 6. The supply crunch stems from China's suspension of magnet exports since April. As the dominant player in the rare earth space—accounting for 60 percent of global production and 90 percent of refining—China’s pause has sent shockwaves through the auto industry, particularly electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers that rely heavily on these components. Also read: Hero MotoCorp Q1 net profit flat at Rs 1,126 crore, but beats estimates ""Non-availabilities have begun to compromise production in June itself, resulting in some shortfalls in deliveries to dealers in June. July has seen a 50 percent shortfall. While we expect production in August to be better than July, we may still see a shortfall of similar levels of 50 percent in this quarter in Chetak and about 25 percent to 30 percent or so in E autos,"" Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director and Chief Technology Officer, said. ""Multiple options, both short-term and long-term term are being pursued at the same time, ranging from simply working with authorities to reopen the flows of HRE magnet as well as to developing alternate sources and alternatives to HRE-based components,"" he added. Rare earth magnets are crucial in EVs, enabling high-performance motors in compact spaces and powering critical electronics. The shortage has not only forced Bajaj Auto to cut output but also weighed on overall industry sales. In July, the company—India’s second-largest electric two-wheeler maker—saw registrations dip 15 percent month-on-month to 19,650 units. Read more: Modi to visit China: Trump’s tariff war bringing rivals together? To prevent further disruption, Bajaj Auto has been quick to adapt. The company is now exploring two parallel tracks: replacing heavy rare earth magnets with more easily available light rare earth variants and developing entirely new technologies that bypass rare earths altogether.

Outlook for August 7 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty remained bearish throughout the day as the index stayed under selling pressure, holding below the 50EMA throughout the session. The RSI continued to display a bearish crossover on both the daily and hourly charts. In addition, a lower-top, lower-bottom formation has developed on the hourly chart, indicating a weakening trend. The index is likely to remain a “sell on rise” as long as it stays below 24,850. In the short term, the index may trend downwards towards 24,400, which is expected to act as a crucial support level on a sustained or closing basis. If Nifty sustains below 24,400, it is likely to witness a more serious correction. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities The choppy movement continued in the market on Wednesday and the RBI's mid quarter policy outcome has failed to lift the sentiment in the market, as Nifty closed the day lower by 75 points. After opening with a flat note, the market slipped into sharp weakness in the early part of the session. There was a minor recovery in the mid part and the market finally closed near the lows. A small negative candle was formed on the daily chart which indicates a narrow range movement in Nifty over the last few sessions near the crucial support of 24500 levels. This is not a good sign and suggests that the said support could eventually be broken decisively on the downside in the near term. The underlying trend of Nifty continues to be weak amidst choppy movement. A sharp breakdown of the support of 24500 could trigger quick decline down to the next support of 24200 levels (200day EMA). Immediate resistance placed at 24800. Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Though Q1FY26 revenue growth (up 7.4% YoY) was muted, we see pick up in coming quarters as insulin shortages stabilize, export pick up and likely additional market share gain from human insulin market. Eris has opted for inorganic route to diversify and scale up existing portfolio. This has been implemented without diluting margins. We expect margins to scale up from the current level of 35% in FY25 as revenue scales up from recent acquisitions, which are currently operating at sub-optimal profitability. The company has multiple growth levers such as broad-based offerings in the derma segment, tapping GLP-1 market, demand supply mismatch in insulin segment, creating large injectable franchise across India and RoW market and benefits of operating leverage.

Triveni Turbine (TRIV) reported a weak quarter, with revenue declining 19.9% YoY and EBITDA margin contracting 81bps YoY to 19.8%. Performance was impacted by geopolitical uncertainties, which led to inspection delays, affecting dispatches, revenue recognition, and export order bookings. Despite a subdued quarter, the management remains optimistic about FY26, supported by a strong increase of ~130% YoY in domestic enquiry pipeline, driven by demand from steel, cement, sugar and process cogeneration sectors along with healthy traction for API as well as drive turbines. However, as Triveni moves to larger value contracts, it may cause lumpiness in the company’s revenue. Meanwhile export enquiries declined ~5% YoY due to weaker demand in Europe, SAARC and Southeast Asia, this was partly offset by ~175% surge in enquiries from the USA and improving traction in Central Asia and Africa. The launch of a new heat pump during the quarter is also expected to expand the company’s export addressable market and open up new avenues for growth. Outlook The stock is trading at a P/E of 40.2x/32.8x on FY26/27E EPS. We maintain ‘BUY’ rating with a revised TP of Rs650 (Rs772 earlier), valuing the stock at a P/E of 40x Mar’27E (same as earlier).

Blended NSR rose 3.8% QoQ, supported by significant price hikes in the East and South regions post Mar’25. Power and fuel costs continued to decline, aided by a higher share of renewable energy, helping SRCM achieve an EBITDA of Rs1,373/t, though other expenses remained elevated. As cement pricing across regions remain sticky aided by relatively better demand, we expect SRCM to deliver strong Q2 on a weak base. With its focus on value over volume, we expect stronger profitability in current market environment. SRCM is on track to achieve 80mtpa capacity by 2028 with planned capacity addition at Rajasthan and Karnataka. However, to outperform the industry volume growth, SRCM may need to recalibrate its value over volume approach by driving volumes and capitalizing on the current pricing stickiness. Over last few quarters, SRCM has lost market share to its peers which remains as a cause of concern. We raise our FY26/27E EBITDA estimates by 8.4%/1.3% on account of better pricing assumptions in near term. Outlook The stock is trading at EV of 19.8x/17.1x FY26/FY27E EBITDA, which appears full. We upgrade our rating to ‘Hold’ with revised TP of Rs30,001 (earlier Reduce with TP Rs29,516) valuing at 17x EV of Mar’27E EBITDA.

The topline growth was driven by the Fluoropolymers segment, which grew 16% YoY and 12% QoQ, supported by higher volumes and a favorable product mix. This segment is expected to grow ~25% in FY26, aided by the exit of a key global player from Dec’24. The Fluorochemicals segment delivered a modest 2% YoY growth, but declined 7% sequentially, due to lower sales of R410A and R125 in the USA. However, R22 prices rose during the quarter and are expected to remain elevated due to global production quota cuts. FLUOROCH also commercialized its R32 capacity during Q1FY26 and aims to ramp it up to 20,000mtpa by the end of FY26. The Bulk Chemicals segment reported a 12% YoY decline, impacted by lower caustic soda prices and planned shutdown of the CMS unit. The Battery Chemicals segment is expected to begin contributing to revenue from H2FY26, with meaningful ramp-up from FY27. Product validation is currently at an advanced stage. Going forward, overall growth will be driven by the Fluoropolymers segment, rising refrigerant prices, and commencement of the Battery Chemicals business.

"Alembic Pharma’s tariff playbook: Cost cuts, complex pipeline and a supply chain armor",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/alembic-pharma-s-tariff-playbook-cost-cuts-complex-pipeline-and-a-supply-chain-armor-13402282.html,"As the threat of Trump’s tariffs on Indian pharmaceutical exports loom large, Alembic Pharmaceuticals said it is doubling down on the US generics business while fortifying supply chain and exploring domestic manufacturing alternatives. In an exclusive interview to Moneycontrol, Managing Director Pranav Amin said Alembic is preparing for multiple tariff scenarios, ranging from benign to disruptive. “Best case is nothing happens to pharma,” Amin said, referring to the proposed tariffs by US President Trump that currently exclude pharmaceutical products. “Even if tariffs do come in at 5-10 percent, they can be absorbed. But anything above 25 percent could make high-volume, low-margin products unviable.” Alembic’s US generics business, making up for over 30 percent of revenue in Q1FY26 rose 13 percent on-year to Rs 523 crore, driven by new launches and rising market share. Read More The company launched four products during the quarter and expects over 15 launches in FY26, with its US portfolio now including 167 commercialized products, supported by 10 manufacturing facilities and 268 ANDA filings. Amin remains bullish on the US market despite pricing pressures and rising competition. “You can’t ignore the US. It’s still profitable, and there are opportunities if you move up the value chain,” he said, pointing to Alembic’s recent acquisition of Utility Therapeutics as a strategic entry into the branded space. Internal Playbook against Tariffs To mitigate the risk of tariffs, Amin said Alembic is pursuing a multi-pronged strategy of backward integration for APIs to reduce dependency on external suppliers, cost optimization through increased throughput and shifting logistics from air to sea, exploring US-based contract manufacturing to de-risk supply chains, and selective acquisitions for high-value, complex products rather than commoditized generics. “There’s no playbook for this. We’re doing it ourselves - sourcing more from India, improving conversion costs, and building resilience,” Amin said, emphasizing that Alembic is not relying on consultants. The Trump administration’s revived tariff agenda has rekindled concerns across Indian exporters. While pharma has so far been spared, the industry remains wary. Tariff on generics could disrupt supply chains and inflate costs in a market where margins are already thin. Some pharma companies have begun acquiring US manufacturing assets to hedge against any policy shock. Amin, however, cautions against reactionary moves. “Don’t buy a US plant just because of tariffs. Do it if you’re targetting government contracts, where local manufacturing is a must.” From API to US Front-end Generic Play Alembic Pharma entered the US market in 2015, transitioning from API exports to direct marketing of generic formulations. Over the past decade, it has invested heavily in building USFDA-compliant manufacturing and R&D to develop a robust pipeline across oral solids, injectables, ophthalmic and dermatology. The US front-end is now well-established with a strong customer base and regulatory track record. Alembic’s US foray received a major boost in 2018 when it benefited from disruptions in the sartan drug market, used in hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, as competitors exited temporarily due to carcinogenic impurities found in the active ingredient. With 223 ANDA approvals and a growing portfolio of complex generics, Alembic is positioning itself for long-term growth - even as it braces for geopolitical headwinds.","As the threat of Trump’s tariffs on Indian pharmaceutical exports loom large, Alembic Pharmaceuticals said it is doubling down on the US generics business while fortifying supply chain and exploring domestic manufacturing alternatives.","Do it if you’re targetting government contracts, where local manufacturing is a must.” From API to US Front-end Generic Play Alembic Pharma entered the US market in 2015, transitioning from API exports to direct marketing of generic formulations.","We’re doing it ourselves - sourcing more from India, improving conversion costs, and building resilience,” Amin said, emphasizing that Alembic is not relying on consultants.","Internal Playbook against Tariffs To mitigate the risk of tariffs, Amin said Alembic is pursuing a multi-pronged strategy of backward integration for APIs to reduce dependency on external suppliers, cost optimization through increased throughput and shifting logistics from air to sea, exploring US-based contract manufacturing to de-risk supply chains, and selective acquisitions for high-value, complex products rather than commoditized generics.",positive,0.9091559052467346
"RBI MPC meet: Experts pick these top 10 rate-sensitive stocks after central bank holds rates, lowers inflation forecast",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/rbi-mpc-meet-experts-pick-these-top-10-rate-sensitive-stocks-after-central-bank-holds-rates-lowers-inflation-forecast-13400864.html,"The Reserve Bank of India Monetary Policy Committee (RBI MPC) on August 6 has decided unanimously to keep the repo rate unchanged at 5.5 percent, and retained the policy stance as 'neutral', citing benign inflation, robust growth, and evolving tariffs uncertainties. This decision follows a cumulative 100 bps rate cut earlier this year and a 25 percent tariff threat on Indian exports by US President Donald Trump. The impact of the 100 bps rate cuts since February 2025 on the economy is still unfolding in the credit markets and the broader economy, hence, the MPC resolved to maintain a close vigil on the incoming data and the evolving domestic growth-inflation dynamics to chart out the appropriate monetary policy path, the central bank said. ""Market participants are likely to view this as a positive signal. A dovish inflation outlook, resilient growth, and policy continuity—without surprise—create a supportive backdrop for equities, especially domestic cyclical sectors,"" Anirudh Garg, Partner and Fund Manager, at INVasset PMS said. According to him, this policy reflects balance—not complacency, suggesting India is entering a phase of monetary stability with an eye on strategic flexibility, rather than immediate intervention. The central bank has lowered its full year inflation outlook further to 3.1 percent from 3.7 percent earlier, and also for Q2 and Q3FY26, driven mainly by lower food inflation that entered deflationary territory in June. However, it believes the CPI inflation is likely to edge up above the 4 percent target from Q4 onwards. ""Core inflation has been rising steadily from the recent low of 3.6 percent recorded during December-January FY25 and averaged 4.3 percent in Q1FY26,"" the RBI said. Meanwhile, the central bank retained its full year economic growth forecast at 6.5 percent given the above normal southwest monsoon, lower inflation, rising capacity utilization and congenial financial conditions, though prospects of external demand remain uncertain amidst ongoing tariff announcements and trade negotiations. The growth is expected to see some pick-up in the coming festive season, it believes. According to Sonam Srivastava, Founder and Fund Manager at Wright Research PMS, the markets are starting to price in a pivot later this year, especially if food inflation eases and global financial conditions soften. She believes rate cuts may materialize in late Q4 FY26, not before. On the equity front, this stance reinforces a case for being selective, with a tilt towards domestic cyclical themes such as financials, industrials, and consumption, which stand to benefit from eventual monetary easing and potential fiscal stimuli ahead of the 2026 elections, she said. After the policy decision, the Nifty 50 was quoting at 24,608, down 41.5 points while nicely defending its previous week's low. The BSE Sensex declined just 20 points to 80,690 at 12:50 hours IST.

Notably, while the broader markets have been under pressure in recent weeks, this counter has displayed relative strength and even outperformed its major peers, with prices comfortably trading above all key moving averages. On the indicator front, the RSI (smoothed) is holding above the 60 mark across all major time frames, signaling strong momentum across the board. Hence, we recommend buying M&M around Rs 3,212 - Rs 3,200. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,550 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,040 L&T Finance | CMP: Rs 204 L&T Finance had a stellar run in June, triggering a long-awaited long-term breakout after more than 8 years. July turned out to be a breather with a consolidation phase. However, with the start of the new month, prices appear to be back in action, hinting at the beginning of a fresh leg of the upmove. Volume analysis supports this view: the rally was backed by strong volumes, while the recent pullback occurred on relatively lower volumes, with prices retracing to short-term moving averages — indicating healthy accumulation. Momentum oscillators also remain in the positive zone, reinforcing the bullish outlook. Hence, we recommend buying L&T Finance around Rs 204 - Rs 200. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 229 Stop-Loss: Rs 193 Indian Bank | CMP: Rs 635 While the broader banking space has struggled over the past couple of months, Indian Bank has shown relative strength by consistently holding above its multi-month bullish breakout levels. In recent sessions, prices have rebounded sharply after testing key support zones, signaling a potential resumption of the primary uptrend. A multi-timeframe analysis reveals that the Monthly and Weekly RSI remain firmly above 80, while a dip in the Daily RSI towards 40 presents a buying opportunity within the prevailing uptrend. Hence, we recommend buying Indian Bank around Rs 635 - Rs 630. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 700 Stop-Loss: Rs 597 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Axis Bank | CMP: Rs 1,070.80 Axis Bank continued to remain under pressure after slipping from its late-June peak of Rs 1,247. The decline has extended, with the stock slipping below key short- and medium-term averages, including the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day SMAs. Recent candles reflect attempts to stabilize near Rs 1,050–1,070, but the recovery lacks decisive strength. The Supertrend resistance stands overhead near Rs 1,107, and price action remains capped below it. The daily RSI has climbed slightly to 31 from sub-25 levels seen last week, but still reflects weak underlying momentum. The MACD remains in negative territory; the signal and MACD lines have not crossed, and the histogram continues to print red bars — suggesting a lack of reversal strength. Price action over the last few sessions has been marked by small-bodied candles, narrow ranges, and lower volumes compared to the late-July breakdown phase — indicating that sellers are pausing, but buyers are not yet in control. The last significant volume uptick came during the breakdown on July 18, and follow-through activity has been muted since then. Sustaining above Rs 1,050 is crucial to prevent further weakness. A breakdown below this level could expose the stock to a slide toward Rs 1,020 or even Rs 1,000, which aligns with prior swing support levels and psychological round figures. On the upside, any sustained move above Rs 1,115–1,125 with volume confirmation would be the first sign of a potential rebound. Only then can one anticipate a gradual retracement toward the Rs 1,150–1,200 zone in the coming weeks. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,150, Rs 1,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,050 Godrej Properties | CMP: Rs 2,114.80 Godrej Properties is currently trading near a crucial demand zone, which also coincides with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level drawn from the major swing low of Rs 1,005 to the peak of Rs 3,999 on the weekly chart — adding strong confluence to this area. Notably, the stock is also hovering near its 200-week exponential moving average (WEMA) — a level that has historically acted as a springboard for price rebounds. Structurally, the stock continues to move within an upward-sloping channel, suggesting sustained accumulation and a potential base-building scenario at current levels. From a momentum perspective, the RSI on both weekly and monthly timeframes remains above the 40 mark, indicating that the stock is not in a bearish trend but rather maintaining a sideways-to-slightly bullish bias. Investors may consider accumulating Godrej Properties around the current market price, with a stop-loss of Rs 1,890, targeting Rs 2,400 in the medium term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,890 Bajaj Finance | CMP: Rs 891.90 Bajaj Finance is currently in a consolidation phase after undergoing a mild corrective move from the Rs 970 zone. The stock has been hovering just above its recent swing low of Rs 870, where it has managed to hold ground for the last few sessions, hinting at an early-stage base formation. However, the short-term outlook remains tentative until it reclaims its key moving averages. The stock is trading below the 20-day and 50-day SMAs, placed at Rs 916 and Rs 922, respectively. Price action is compressed below these levels, forming narrow-bodied candles. The RSI has rebounded to 41 from oversold territory but remains below its signal line (46), suggesting that momentum is attempting to stabilize but hasn’t reversed yet. The MACD remains in negative territory, with a slight narrowing in the histogram, indicating a possible shift in trend — but no confirmation so far. Volume participation remains moderate, with no significant spike to confirm strong accumulation. The Bollinger Bands have started to contract, signaling reduced volatility and potential for a directional breakout ahead. Holding above Rs 870 will be important to preserve the emerging support. A sustained close above Rs 920 would mark a reclaim of the 20-day SMA and potentially trigger fresh upside toward the Rs 950–970 zone. On the downside, a breach below Rs 865 could extend the corrective leg toward Rs 840, the next visible horizontal support from the March–April price action.The broader trend remains intact as long as the stock holds above key medium-term support levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 950, Rs 970 Stop-Loss: Rs 865 Vidnyan Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital TVS Motor Company | CMP: Rs 2,983.2 TVS Motor has exhibited robust outperformance on the weekly chart, breaking out of a base formation and a 16-week consolidation zone, signaling a strong continuation of its uptrend. On the daily timeframe, the stock remains firmly above its key 12-, 26-, and 50-day EMAs, indicating sustained strength. The MACD has shown a bullish crossover. The stock recently registered a new all-time high, further reinforcing the prevailing bullish momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,342 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,834 SBI Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 1,857 SBI Life Insurance has been displaying relative strength for the past three consecutive months. A long lower wick candlestick near its 5-month EMA indicates renewed buying interest at support. On the weekly chart, the stock has remained rangebound for six weeks, suggesting consolidation. On the daily timeframe, a bullish mean reversion from the 50-day EMA highlights positive price development and the potential for a breakout. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,990 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,785 RBL Bank | CMP: Rs 265.70 RBL Bank has been in a rising trend since January 2025, consistently forming higher highs and higher lows, highlighting a strong bullish structure. The stock is trading well above its 5-, 12-, and 26-week EMAs, reinforcing the trend. On the daily chart, it has shown a bullish mean reversion from the 26-day EMA, indicating renewed buying interest. The MACD remains in buy mode, suggesting sustained momentum and strengthening the case for further upside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 287 Stop-Loss: Rs 255 Bharat K Gala President, Technical Head at Ventura Jindal Steel & Power | CMP: Rs 1,000 The primary downtrend in Jindal Steel & Power began at Rs 1,095 (June 2024) and reached a low of Rs 724 in February 2025. The stock later rebounded to a high of Rs 986 in May 2025. It traded in the range of Rs 720–985 from February to July 2025. Recently, the stock formed a positive price candle, trading above key averages and is on the verge of giving a triangle breakout, making a high of Rs 1,002.85. Indicators like Aroon Up/Down, Demand Index, and MACD are positive, suggesting high probability of a further up move. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,350 Stop-Loss: Rs 880 Tata Investment Corporation | CMP: Rs 7,138 The primary move in Tata Investment started at Rs 1,751 in April 2023. It touched a high of Rs 9,744.40 in March 2024, followed by profit booking, forming a higher bottom at Rs 1,873 in April 2024. This was followed by a valid correction, which brought the stock down to a low of Rs 5,180 in February 2025. Since then, the stock traded in a range of Rs 5,180 to Rs 8,100 for a prolonged period, frequently taking support at key moving averages. Recently, the stock has given a range breakout, making a high of Rs 7,625, supported by strong volumes after a phase of consolidation and continuous average support. Hence, the probability of a further upmove is high, with positive indications from the Aroon Up/Down, Demand Index, and MACD.

The public sector bank is scheduled to announce its Q1FY26 results on August 8, 2025. According to Moneycontrol's poll, SBI’s net interest income (NII) is likely to grow modestly by 3 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 42,347 crore in Q1FY26, up from Rs 41,125 crore in the same quarter last year. The bank’s profit too is expected to rise marginally by 0.7 percent to Rs 17,166 crore in Q1FY26 versus Rs 17,035 crore in the year-ago period. Estimates of analysts polled by Moneycontrol are shown to be in a diverse range, meaning any positive or negative surprises may elicit a sharp reaction in the stock price. Among the brokerages polled, Prabhudas Lilladher Capital rolled out the most bullish projections while Equirus Research forecasted the slowest growth for SBI. What factors are driving the earnings? Margin contraction: Analysts anticipate some pressure on margins, with Emkay forecasting a 28 basis point contraction in net interest margin (NIM) year-on-year. SBI’s NIM is expected to come in at 2.9 percent for Q1FY26, compared to 3.2 percent a year ago. Stable asset quality: Analysts at Motilal Oswal expect gross non-performing assets (GNPA) to decline to 1.8 percent from 2.2 percent in the same period last year, while net NPA is likely to improve to 0.5 percent from 0.6 percent. Healthy loan growth: Loan growth is expected to remain healthy, in the range of 13 to 14 percent year-on-year, led by strong traction in both retail (especially housing and auto) and corporate segments, according to Ashika Institutional Equities.

No rate cut? Why the RBI’s ‘hawkish pause’ could still be good news for markets,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/no-rate-cut-why-the-rbi-s-hawkish-pause-could-still-be-good-news-for-markets-13401811.html,"The Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) kept policy rates unchanged, delivering what economists may brand as a “hawkish pause.” At first glance, the decision may disappoint those hoping for rate relief. But its outlook for the next year certainly gives some reason to cheer. GDP growth projections for the current fiscal year were left unchanged, a move widely expected given the persistent global uncertainties. But surprise, surprise — the MPC pegged its forecast for the first quarter of FY27 at 6.6 percent, higher than the 6.5 percent projected for FY26. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates That signals stronger confidence in the economy’s momentum heading into next year. Inflation projections for FY26, on the contrary, have been cut to 3.1 percent from 3.7 percent earlier, though for the first quarter of next fiscal, it has been pegged at 4.9 percent. Most economists also feel inflation won’t stay down for too long and, in fact, depending on how Trump tariffs settle, there could be a risk of higher inflation — something the MPC recognises in its projections. So, here is the broad picture: if we have consumer inflation running at close to 5 percent, there is no case for the repo rate, which is already just a quarter percentage point above the projected inflation, to be cut much from hereon. Rates should at least cover inflation, so savers do not stand impoverished (not that we have not had long periods of negative “real rate” in the past!). More importantly, rate cuts are an ammo for central banks to trigger growth by making credit enticing for borrowers. And if growth is not suffering, there is no need to cut rates anyway. Also read: MPC meeting: RBI cuts FY26 inflation forecast to 3.1% from 3.7% At the same time, the reality today is that credit growth is in single digits, and that is not because credit is expensive but because there is fear and uncertainty on several counts. Apart from the risk of Trump tariffs — which will eventually determine if, when, and where private capex will come up — there is fear of AI-led job losses, which could hit a cohort that usually borrows the most: home loans, car loans, and durable loans. Besides visible stress in the microfinance and MSME segments, there is also the threat of stress rising in the MSME sector. That’s why RBI’s GDP growth forecast for the first quarter of next fiscal brings greater cheer. But, it does not take away the uncertainty. It is the mixed feeling that the bond markets showed some disappointment, with a modest uptick in yields — the 10‑year G‑sec rose from 6.33 to 6.37 percent. But stock markets hardly moved. Bank stocks were nonchalant about the MPC announcement, with leading banks clocking less than 1 percent gains today, for it strictly means no gains or losses for banks right away — there is no scope for treasury bounties, nor can the GDP growth projection be taken as a guarantee of better credit growth. The future is always uncertain, but in today’s business climate, there is a vast array of scenarios that could play out one year out. For now, strong growth and still‑firm inflation leave little reason to cut rates. But if the dust settles on Trump tariffs and the Fed also considers a rate cut, October could bring the first opening for a rate cut. For investors, the takeaway is that the RBI is holding back its firepower until it’s needed — and the prospect of easing later in the year may still be on the table. Till then, for stock markets, the focus will need to be on earnings, stock by stock.",That’s why RBI’s GDP growth forecast for the first quarter of next fiscal brings greater cheer.,"Also read: MPC meeting: RBI cuts FY26 inflation forecast to 3.1% from 3.7% At the same time, the reality today is that credit growth is in single digits, and that is not because credit is expensive but because there is fear and uncertainty on several counts.","Most economists also feel inflation won’t stay down for too long and, in fact, depending on how Trump tariffs settle, there could be a risk of higher inflation — something the MPC recognises in its projections.","For investors, the takeaway is that the RBI is holding back its firepower until it’s needed — and the prospect of easing later in the year may still be on the table.",negative,0.8406798839569092

At about 12:10 pm, the Sensex was down 114.68 points or 0.14 percent at 80,595.57, and the Nifty was down 61.40 points or 0.25 percent at 24,588.15. About 966 shares advanced, 2461 shares declined, and 127 shares were unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates ""President Trump’s recent statements and policy actions are expected to keep market sentiment under pressure in the near term. India’s response so far has been restrained, but increasingly firm and calibrated. It's unlikely that India will yield to what are seen as unjustified demands from the US administration. This could result in some near-term economic headwinds, including a dip in exports and a slight downward revision in FY26 GDP growth — potentially around 6.2 percent, compared to the earlier estimate of 6.5 percent,"" V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, said. ""In its monetary policy announcement today, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept the repo rate unchanged at 5.5 percent, while maintaining a “neutral” policy stance. This comes despite rising global uncertainties, including the threat of potential US tariffs and ongoing geopolitical tensions. Significantly, the RBI retained its GDP growth forecast at 6.5 percent for FY26, citing robust domestic macroeconomic fundamentals. Inflation continues to remain well within the central bank’s comfort zone, with projections around 3 percent in FY25-26, well below the upper tolerance level,"" Aamar Deo Singh, VP of Research at Angel One, said. At mid-day, sectoral indices on the NSE were trading mostly in the red, reflecting broad-based weakness across the market. The Nifty Pharma index was among the top losers, down 1.61 percent, followed by Nifty Media and Nifty IT, which slipped 1.70 percent and 1.59 percent, respectively. Realty stocks also came under pressure, with the Nifty Realty index falling 2.17 percent. Other notable laggards included Nifty Consumer Durables (-1.24 percent), Nifty Midcap 100 (-1.21 percent), and Nifty Smallcap 100 (-1.52 percent). Auto, FMCG, Energy, and Metal indices also posted declines of around 0.7 to 0.9 percent. Banking indices fared relatively better, with Nifty Bank down 0.19 percent, Nifty PSU Bank slipping 0.36 percent, and Nifty Private Bank easing 0.24 percent. The India VIX, a gauge of market volatility, rose 1.88 percent to 11.93, indicating some nervousness among traders. Also read: MPC meeting: RBI cuts FY26 inflation forecast to 3.1% from 3.7% Indian pharmaceutical giants like Sun Pharma, Cipla, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, and Lupin, among others, saw steep cuts of up to 2 percent in the morning on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump said he would sharply raise tariffs on imported medicines. In an interview with CNBC, Trump said the new duties would begin at a modest rate but could increase significantly over time. “We’ll be putting an initially small tariff on pharmaceuticals, but in one year, one-and-a-half years, maximum, it’s going to go to 150 percent and then 250 percent. Bharti Hexacom shares declined 4 percent on August 4 after global brokerage firm CLSA downgraded shares on to 'Underperform', following the Bharti Airtel unit's Q1 FY26 earnings report, which came in below expectations. Bharti Hexacom's revenue stood at Rs 2,260 crore, down 1 percent quarter-on-quarter, but up 18 percent year-on-year. Gland Pharma rose 4 percent after the company's profit after tax (PAT) for the quarter ended June stood at Rs 215 crore, up 50 percent from Rs 143 crore reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal year. Consolidated revenue from operations figures stood at Rs 1,505 crore in Q1FY26, as against Rs 1,401 crore reported in the year-ago period, marking a rise of 7 percent. Technical View Nifty once again failed to hold above the 24,700 mark in the morning session and spent most of the day oscillating near the 24,600 level, reflecting a cautious undertone. The index remains at a critical juncture and requires clearer direction in the coming sessions. Our view remains unchanged — holding above the key support level of 24,500 is essential to maintain the broader uptrend. A breach below this zone could trigger deeper selling, with the next major support seen around the 24,000 mark. Asian Paints, Trent, HUL, Adani Ports, and ICICI Bank were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included IndusInd Bank, Dr Reddy's, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, and Eternal.

Pharma stocks fall up to 2% as Trump threatens steep tariffs on drug imports,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/pharma-stocks-fall-up-to-2-as-trump-threatens-steep-tariffs-on-drug-imports-13400856.html,"Indian pharmaceutical giants like Sun Pharma, Cipla, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, and Lupin, among others, saw steep cuts of up to 2 percent in the morning on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump said he would sharply raise tariffs on imported medicines. In an interview with CNBC, Trump said the new duties would begin at a modest rate but could increase significantly over time. “We’ll be putting an initially small tariff on pharmaceuticals, but in one year, one-and-a-half years, maximum, it’s going to go to 150 percent and then 250 percent, because we want pharmaceuticals made in our country,” he said, without disclosing the starting tariff rate. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The remarks have added to fears of rising protectionism, particularly in critical sectors like healthcare and technology. Trump also indicated that tariffs on semiconductors and chips could be unveiled “next week or so,” although he did not share specifics. The US government has long sought to shift pharmaceutical manufacturing back to domestic soil, citing both economic and national security concerns. A formal review of the pharma sector is currently underway, with industry-specific tariffs under discussion — though there’s no clear timeline for when the findings will be released. At present, trade between the US and the European Union in pharmaceuticals and semiconductors is tariff-free under a bilateral framework. Should new import duties be implemented following the investigation, they would reportedly be capped at 15 percent under the terms of that agreement. Also read: RBI keeps repo rate unchanged with an eye on Trump's tariff threats The proposed tariffs could deliver a significant setback to the pharmaceutical industry, which has cautioned that such measures may inflate drug costs, discourage investment in the US, and disrupt supply chains — potentially putting patients at risk. Many drugmakers are already grappling with the effects of Trump’s drug pricing initiatives, which they argue threaten both profitability and their ability to fund research and innovation. In a fresh move last week, Trump sent letters to 17 pharmaceutical companies, urging them to commit to lowering drug prices in the US by September 29. Among the demands: offering their full portfolio of existing medicines to every Medicaid patient at the lowest price available in any developed country. Trump’s latest comments could weigh on sentiment for Indian drugmakers, which count the US as a key export market. As investors assess the risks of a shifting trade landscape, pharma counters may remain in focus in the days ahead. At about 11 am, the Nifty Pharma index was down 1.3 percent to 21,686. Divis Labs, Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy's, Cipla, and Glenmark Pharma were the major laggards on the index.

Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) on August 5 reported a net profit of Rs 3,315 crore for Q1 FY26.

""Haifa port operated unhindered throughout and reported 25% YoY growth in container volume and 38% YoY growth in other cargo volume during the quarter, leading to overall volume growth of 29% YoY.

The international brokerage noted that the firm's Q1 traffic was up 11 percent on-year, and it maintained its robust FY26 guidance. The Adani Group company implied an EBITDA growth of 14-20 percent on-year, despite a hazy global trade picture, it added. CLSA said that the firm's EBITDA margin improved on the back of price hikes, a better cargo mix and rupee depreciation. Jefferies kept a 'Buy' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,815 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 33 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage noted that the firm’s quarterly EBITDA was above estimates, while management reiterated its focus on absolute EBITDA growth.

Asian stocks cautious as US data clouds Fed path,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-cautious-as-us-data-clouds-fed-path-13398710.html,"Asian shares traded in a narrow range as weak US services data fueled uncertainty over the Federal Reserve’s policy path, while shares of chipmakers and pharmaceutical companies declined on tariff threats. Japanese shares rose while South Korean stocks dropped. The broader MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed. Asian chip-related stocks and some pharmaceutical companies fell after President Donald Trump said he will announce tariffs on the sectors “within the next week or so.” Treasuries edged lower with the yield on the 10-year gaining almost one basis point to 4.22%. Oil edged up after four consecutive days of declines while a gauge of the dollar was steady. US equity-index futures slipped. The S&P 500 was on the brink of all-time highs on Tuesday, before losing steam. The pullback in stocks highlighted investor anxiety over the Fed’s next move, with economic data complicating the central bank’s balancing act between controlling inflation and sustaining growth. Stocks had rallied Monday amid growing bets on potential rate cuts after weak jobs data last week. “We expect further choppy trading to persist in the later stages of summer, especially as the path of interest-rate policy remains unknown and highly sensitive to incoming economic data,” said Chris Senyek at Wolfe Research. The US services sector effectively stagnated in July as firms — faced with tepid demand and rising costs — reduced headcount. The data, released Tuesday, painted a picture of a sluggish service economy wrestling with the fallout of higher tariffs, cautious consumers and uncertainty stemming from Trump’s policies. Data out last week showed weaker-than-expected jobs data while inflation-adjusted consumer spending barely rose. “Traders are continuing to speculate on the time of the Fed’s next rate cuts with sticky inflation signs weighed against weakening economic indicators,” said Fawad Razaqzada at City Index and Forex.com. He also noted the S&P 500 outlook could start to deteriorate in the near-term amid warnings over sky-high valuations against a backdrop of weakening economy. Asian chip-related stocks declined after a stream of negative news, including a Taiwanese probe into an alleged theft of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s trade secrets. Shares of the chipmaker fell 1.7% Wednesday. Also, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. warned that its access to the crucial China market remains uncertain. Super Micro Computer Inc. tumbled after its results missed expectations. In other tariff news, Trump said he was “getting very close to a deal” with Beijing. Trump also suggested he would impose increased tariffs on additional countries buying energy from Russia — including China — after saying earlier Tuesday that he would raise levies on Indian exports within 24 hours. India is racing to contain the economic fallout from Trump’s threatened tariffs, which has left officials in New Delhi feeling shocked, jilted and unsure of how to respond. Indian shares and the currency fell Tuesday ahead of the central bank’s rate decision later Wednesday. In other tariff news, Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter arrived in Washington to make a last-minute bid for a deal to lower the 39% tariff imposed last week. The trip is to “facilitate meetings with the US authorities at short notice and hold talks,” the government said in a statement.","Asian shares traded in a narrow range as weak US services data fueled uncertainty over the Federal Reserve’s policy path, while shares of chipmakers and pharmaceutical companies declined on tariff threats.",Asian chip-related stocks and some pharmaceutical companies fell after President Donald Trump said he will announce tariffs on the sectors “within the next week or so.” Treasuries edged lower with the yield on the 10-year gaining almost one basis point to 4.22%.,The US services sector effectively stagnated in July as firms — faced with tepid demand and rising costs — reduced headcount.,Asian chip-related stocks and some pharmaceutical companies fell after President Donald Trump said he will announce tariffs on the sectors “within the next week or so.” Treasuries edged lower with the yield on the 10-year gaining almost one basis point to 4.22%.,negative,0.9649599194526672

Interestingly, there were five companies in the top 10 list — in terms of the biggest jump in retail holding — with a market capitalisation of less than Rs 300 crore. This, even as some of the companies saw the stock price plunge during the quarter. As per data from primeinfobase.com, the share of stake held by retail investors in companies listed on NSE went up to 7.53 percent as on June 30 from 7.51 percent as on March 31. In value terms, retail holding stood at Rs 34.25 lakh crore on June 30. More importantly however, the companies that saw the highest jump in the stake held by retail investors during the June quarter were all from the mid/small-cap universe. For instance, Shanti Overseas (India) saw the highest jump in retail holding – 69.83 percent as on June 30 from 26.52 percent as on March 31. The company that migrated from the SME segment to the main board in 2021 has a market capitalisation of only Rs 12.65 crore. Wendt (India), which has a market capitalisation of Rs 1,972 crore, saw the retail holding move from 16.14 percent in the March quarter to 37.32 percent as on June 30. Some of the other companies that saw the largest jump in retail holding during the June quarter were Hilton Metal Forging (mcap of Rs 134 crore), M M Forgings (Rs 1,642 crore), Oriental Trimex (Rs 69 crore), Hi-Tech Pipes (Rs 1,808 crore), Protean eGov Technologies (Rs 3,093 crore), Capital Trust (Rs 136 crore), One Mobikwik Systems (Rs 1,864 crore) and Balaxi Pharmaceuticals (Rs 265 crore). Incidentally, a majority of these companies saw their share price plunge in the June quarter with some shedding more than 20 percent as well.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Bank of Baroda, BLS International, Godawari Power, ICICI Prudential, BHEL, DMart and others on August 6?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-bank-of-baroda-bls-international-godawari-power-icici-prudential-bhel-dmart-and-others-on-august-6-13398367.html,"Equity benchmarks corrected after a day of rally, with the Nifty 50 declining by a third of a percent on August 5, as the market breadth was skewed in favour of bears. About 1,608 shares were under pressure compared to 1,069 shares that advanced on the NSE. The consolidation with a negative bias is expected to persist in the upcoming sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities Bank of Baroda | CMP: Rs 240.65 After a decline from higher levels, Bank of Baroda has rebounded from its support zone on the daily charts. Moreover, there was a sloping trendline breakout along with decent volume activity. The stock is witnessing a steady recovery from lower levels. The upward movement in the stock suggests a new leg of the bullish trend in the near term. As long as the stock is trading above Rs 230, the bullish momentum is likely to continue. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 260 Stop-Loss: Rs 230 ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 614.75 On the daily timeframe, ICICI Prudential Life had been in a downtrend. It is now in oversold territory and within its demand area. The texture of the chart formation and technical indicators such as the RSI indicate that the stock is very likely to rebound for a new leg of the uptrend from its demand zone. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 590 could be the trend-deciding level for the bulls. If the stock sustains above this level, we can expect a further uptrend towards Rs 660. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 660 Stop-Loss: Rs 590 Tata Consumer Products | CMP: Rs 1,064.8 After the remarkable uptrend of the last few weeks, Tata Consumer Products witnessed a short-term correction from higher levels. However, on the weekly charts, the stock is near an important retracement zone. The chart formation suggests a revival of the uptrend from the current levels. For traders, Rs 1,020 would be the key support level to watch. Above this level, the uptrend could continue towards Rs 1,140. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,140 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,020 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors BLS International Services | CMP: Rs 399.55 On the daily timeframe, BLS International Services has been consolidating in a range between Rs 351–392 since June 2025. In the previous session, the stock managed to break out of the upper end of the range, closing near Rs 399. Over the past six trading sessions, the stock has held above the previous candle’s low on a closing basis, which is a positive sign. After the sharp rise, buying on dips appears to be a wiser strategy for riding the ongoing trend with better risk management. After the breakout, we can expect good momentum on the upside in the upcoming sessions. One can use dips as a buying opportunity. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 420, Rs 438 Stop-Loss: Rs 385 Hero MotoCorp | CMP: 4,546.8 On the daily chart, Hero MotoCorp has been trading within a broader range of Rs 4,150 to Rs 4,490 since May 2025. Since the start of this week, the auto sector has outperformed other sectors, with Hero MotoCorp emerging as one of its key contributors, which is a strong bullish sign. The stock has already broken out of the mentioned range, which is again a positive sign. Moreover, Bollinger Bands have started to expand, indicating increased volatility, with prices closing above the upper bands, which can further boost positive momentum in the stock. Along with this, the MACD has just witnessed a bullish crossover, providing double confirmation for our stance. The current trend for Hero MotoCorp has shifted in favour of the bulls. One should use dips as a buying opportunity. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,700, Rs 4815 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,330 Godawari Power and Ispat | CMP: Rs 200 In the previous session, despite major indices falling, Godawari Power and Ispat managed to gain 1.8%, indicating that bulls are getting active in the stock. Prices have been respecting their upward-sloping trendline since March 2025. Additionally, the stock has managed to retrace 50% of its fall that began in December 2024. With follow-up buying, prices may retrace up to 61.8% of the fall, which comes near Rs 212, coinciding with its previous swing highs. The current trend for GPIL favours the bulls. A break above Rs 202 could further accelerate positive momentum towards Rs 212, followed by Rs 225. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 212, Rs 225 Stop-Loss: Rs 192 Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities Avenue Supermarts | CMP: Rs 4,257.8 Avenue Supermarts (DMart) is in a healthy intermediate uptrend after touching a low of Rs 3,340 in March 2025. Last week, the stock bounced back strongly from the 200-day SMA and cleared its nearby resistances in the process. The stock also traded above the 20-day and 50-day SMAs, with momentum indicators like the 14-day RSI in rising mode and not overbought. This indicates that the uptrend is likely to continue. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,700 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,931 BHEL | CMP: Rs 248.25 BHEL has reversed its recent downtrend after touching a low of Rs 230. The stock has comfortably moved above the 200-day EMA on the back of healthy volumes. On the weekly chart, the stock found support near the 20-week and 50-week SMAs, bouncing back this week. Momentum indicators like the 14-day RSI are rising and not overbought, which is favourable for the continuation of the uptrend.

The anti-dumping duty on ""Black Toner in Powder Form"" imported from China PR, Malaysia, and Chinese Taipei (Taiwan) will continue, providing a competitive edge for domestic manufacturers. The Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue, through notification No. 26/2025-CUSTOMS(ADD) dated August 4, 2025, has extended the duty for five years. The duty will be payable in Indian currency and is effective from August 11, 2025, until August 10, 2030. The extension follows the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) final findings in Final Report No. 7/12/2024-DGTR, which concluded that ending the duty would likely lead to renewed dumping and harm to the domestic industry. The initial anti-dumping duties were imposed via Notification No. 12/2021-Customs (ADD) dated March 5, 2021. The duty aims to foster a more level playing field for Indian manufacturers. DGTR's review determined that the removal of the duty would likely result in a recurrence of dumping practices.

"Toyota reports a 37% drop in profit, cuts its forecast due to Trump's tariffs",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/toyota-reports-a-37-drop-in-profit-cuts-its-forecast-due-to-trumps-tariffs-2025-08-07/,"TOKYO (AP) — Toyota's profit plunged 37% in the April-June quarter, the company said Thursday, cutting its full year earnings forecasts largely because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The Japanese automaker said it based its report on the assumption that Trump’s tariffs on exports from Japan, including autos, would be 12.5% starting this month. As of now they stand at 15%. The world’s top automaker also makes vehicles in Mexico and Canada. Toyota’s profit in the last quarter totaled 841 billion yen, or $5.7 billion, down from 1.33 trillion yen in the same period the year before. Its quarterly sales rose 3%. The status of those exports is unclear since Mexico and Canada are beneficiaries of the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement, renegotiated from a 1990s pact during Trump's first term in office, that eliminated most tariffs and trade barriers between the three countries. Toyota Motor Corp.’s April-June profit totaled 841 billion yen ($5.7 billion), down from 1.33 trillion yen in the same period of 2024. Quarterly sales rose 3% to 12 trillion yen ($82 billion). Toyota said the tariffs cost its quarterly operating profit 450 billion yen ($3 billion). Cost reduction efforts and the negative impact of an unfavorable exchange rate also hurt its bottom line. The company, which makes the Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models, forecast a 2.66 trillion yen ($18 billion) profit for the full fiscal year ending in March 2026, down from an earlier forecast for a 3.1 trillion yen ($21 billion) profit. Toyota earned nearly 4.8 trillion yen in the previous fiscal year. “Despite a challenging external environment, we have continued to make comprehensive investments, as well as improvements such as increased unit sales, cost reductions and expanded value chain profits,” Toyota said in a statement that outlined its efforts to minimize the impact of the tariffs. At the retail level, Toyota sold 2.4 million vehicles globally, with sales growing in Japan, North America and Europe from the previous year, when global retail totaled 2.2 million vehicles. Analysts say Toyota is likely among the worst hit by the tariffs among global companies, even compared with other Japanese automakers. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on Threads: https://www.threads.com/@yurikageyama Before you consider Toyota Motor, you'll want to hear this.",Quarterly sales rose 3% to 12 trillion yen ($82 billion).,"The company, which makes the Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models, forecast a 2.66 trillion yen ($18 billion) profit for the full fiscal year ending in March 2026, down from an earlier forecast for a 3.1 trillion yen ($21 billion) profit.",Cost reduction efforts and the negative impact of an unfavorable exchange rate also hurt its bottom line.,"The company, which makes the Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models, forecast a 2.66 trillion yen ($18 billion) profit for the full fiscal year ending in March 2026, down from an earlier forecast for a 3.1 trillion yen ($21 billion) profit.",negative,0.9760854244232178
Germans worry their beloved kebab may get more pricy or even scarce because of factory strike,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/germans-worry-their-beloved-kebab-may-get-more-pricy-or-even-scarce-because-of-factory-strike-2025-08-07/,"BERLIN (AP) — Germans are in kebab angst. They worry that their most beloved street food option, the spicy, juicy kebab in a pita that can be found on every street corner across Germany, may get more expensive — or even worse, that the country may be sliding into a national kebab shortage. Even if these fears may sound exaggerated at first, they aren't unfounded. Workers at one of Germany's biggest kebab factories are locked in a bitter and ongoing fight with their employer over wages and working conditions. For weeks, workers at the Birtat Meat World SE factory in southwestern Germany have repeatedly stopped the production line by walking off their jobs in ""warning strikes,” demanding wage increases of 375 euros ($434) per month. Their current salaries vary widely, and haven't been disclosed. The Food, Beverages and Catering Union that represents them says that payment methods are nontransparent and workers are making vastly different salaries for the same kind of job, according to German news agency dpa. Workers are also trying to organize a collective contract agreement for all employees with the help of the union. Many workers are immigrants from Turkey, Romania or Bulgaria, who spend long, tough workdays in the factory, which has near freezing temperatures to keep the raw meat fresh. On Wednesday, many workers walked off their jobs again, waving flags in front of the factory's main gate, playing drums, whistling and shouting for higher salaries and unionized contracts. German media have reported that Birtat hasn't yielded to any of the demands so far. The company didn't immediately respond to requests for an interview. Birtat, which is located in Murr, 30 kilometers (nearly 20 miles) north of Stuttgart, has been making kebab skewers for more than 30 years. The company says on its website that it makes skewers of ground beef, veal, chicken or turkey kebab that can weigh up to 120 kilograms (260 pounds). The workers chop up the meat, marinate it and push chunks of the raw produce on long metal skewers. The meat is then shock-frozen and and delivered to restaurants all over the country. Birtat says it supplies thousands of kebab stands and fast food places and reaches more than 13 million consumers every month. Some restaurant owners worry that should the workers decide to go on a long-term strike, the Germans' favorite fast-food snack may indeed become more expensive or even scarce. Germans already complain that the meaty snack, which used to be a cheap staple that sold for 2.50 euros about two decades ago, has become too expensive, with most places charging at least 7 euros ($8) or more. Halil Duman was pondering the state of the kebab business as he was busy slicing off thin pieces of ground beef at Pergamon Döner, a small eatery at Berlin’s Friedrichstrasse train station where people were lining up for lunch. “It's all getting more and more difficult,"" the 68-year-old Turkish immigrant said. ""The produce is becoming more expensive and we barely make profit anymore.” “But if we raise the prices any further, people won't buy here anymore,” said Duman, who has been working at kebab stores in the German capital for more than 30 years and was selling the classic kebab sandwich for 7.50 euros (around $8.70). Germans have long fancied the kebab sandwich, which is called a döner in Germany. The word comes from the Turkish verb “donmek,” meaning to turn — the meat is grilled for hours on a spit and cut off in razor-thin slices when it's crisp and brown. First brought to Berlin by Turkish immigrants in the 1970s, the grilled meat snack, which comes wrapped in pita bread with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, onions and different dressings, is now sold everywhere in Germany, from regions stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Bavarian Alps. According to legend, it was Mahmut Aygun, a Turkish guest worker, who invented the first döner sandwich in 1971, when he sold the meat in a piece of pita bread with yogurt dressing at a stand close to a main train station next to the zoo in West Berlin. About 2.9 million people with Turkish roots live in Germany — but the döner kebab sandwich has become so ubiquitous in the country that many foreign tourists consider it typically German and don't even know about the snack's immigrant past. Nele Langfeld, a 22-year-old university student, had come to Pergamon Döner because she was craving the yummy comfort food after having just finished an exam. Waiting in line for her turn, she said that while she hadn't heard about the labor dispute at Birtat, she sure didn't like the prospect of a possible döner shortage or higher prices. “I live on a budget and that's the last thing I need,” she said. “Döner is the one affordable meal that really fills your stomach — it should stay that way.”","Waiting in line for her turn, she said that while she hadn't heard about the labor dispute at Birtat, she sure didn't like the prospect of a possible döner shortage or higher prices.","""The produce is becoming more expensive and we barely make profit anymore.” “But if we raise the prices any further, people won't buy here anymore,” said Duman, who has been working at kebab stores in the German capital for more than 30 years and was selling the classic kebab sandwich for 7.50 euros (around $8.70).","Nele Langfeld, a 22-year-old university student, had come to Pergamon Döner because she was craving the yummy comfort food after having just finished an exam.","According to legend, it was Mahmut Aygun, a Turkish guest worker, who invented the first döner sandwich in 1971, when he sold the meat in a piece of pita bread with yogurt dressing at a stand close to a main train station next to the zoo in West Berlin.",neutral,0.9172932505607605
The Latest: Trump's tariffs go into effect,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-latest-trumps-tariffs-go-into-effect-2025-08-07/,"The U.S. began officially levying higher taxes on imports from dozens of countries Thursday, four months after President Donald Trump first announced plans to impose tariffs on most of the world while seeking new trade agreements across the board. The White House said that starting just after midnight goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union would face tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea will be taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh will be taxed at 20%. Trump also expects places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. The Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world’s largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes they can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power. But so far, economic data has shown a U.S. economy that began flagging after Trump’s initial rollout of tariffs in April. Here's the latest: A top body of Indian exporters said Thursday the latest U.S. tariffs will impact nearly 55% of the country’s outbound shipments to America and force exporters to lose their long-standing clients. “Absorbing this sudden cost escalation is simply not viable. Margins are already thin,” S.C. Ralhan, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said in a statement. The tariffs effectively impose a cost burden, placing Indian exporters at a competitive disadvantage with countries that have lesser import taxes, he added. In 2024, the U.S. ran a $45.8 billion trade deficit in goods with India, meaning America imported more from India than it exported, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. American consumers and businesses buy pharmaceutical drugs, precious stones, and textiles and apparel from India, among other goods. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said India will never compromise the interests of farmers. “For us, the interests of farmers are a top priority. I know I will have to personally pay a heavy price for it, but I am ready,” Modi said at a conference in what was seen as a message to the U.S. administration, which has been seeking greater access to India’s agriculture and dairy sectors. India and the U.S. have had five rounds of negotiations on a bilateral trade agreement, but haven’t been able to clinch one so far. On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order to place an additional 25% tariff on India for its purchases of Russian oil. The order would go into effect in 21 days and bring the combined tariffs imposed on India to 50%. Japanese entertainment and electronics company Sony said Thursday its profit surged 23% in the last quarter from the year before, as damage from U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs was less than it had expected. Sony raised its forecast for its profit in the full fiscal year until March 2026 to 970 billion yen ($6.6 billion), from an earlier forecast of 930 billion yen ($6.3 billion). The revised projection is still lower than what it earned in the previous fiscal year at 1 trillion yen. Sony now estimates the impact of the additional U.S. tariffs on its operating income at 70 billion yen ($476 million), much better than the initial estimate of 100 billion yen ($680 million).","Sony raised its forecast for its profit in the full fiscal year until March 2026 to 970 billion yen ($6.6 billion), from an earlier forecast of 930 billion yen ($6.3 billion).","I know I will have to personally pay a heavy price for it, but I am ready,” Modi said at a conference in what was seen as a message to the U.S. administration, which has been seeking greater access to India’s agriculture and dairy sectors.","India and the U.S. have had five rounds of negotiations on a bilateral trade agreement, but haven’t been able to clinch one so far.",Here's the latest: A top body of Indian exporters said Thursday the latest U.S. tariffs will impact nearly 55% of the country’s outbound shipments to America and force exporters to lose their long-standing clients.,negative,0.9551966786384583

Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 added 0.6% to 41,025.76. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng climbed 0.6% to 25,057.84 and the Shanghai Composite added 0.1% to 3,637.96. China reported that its exports picked up in July, helped by a flurry of shipments by businesses taking advantage of a pause in U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff war with Beijing. South Korea’s Kospi rose 0.6% to 3,217.67 while the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia shed 0.2% to 8,828.70. India’s Sensex gave up 0.6% after Trump ordered tariffs on imports from the world's most populous nation to rise to 50%, citing its crude oil imports from Russia. Trump also declared 100% tariffs on computer chips with an exemption for U.S. investments. Apple's shares rose 5.1% on Wednesday ahead of a White House event where it announced an increase to its U.S. investments of an additional $100 billion over the next four years. Mizuho Bank, in a commentary, said the Trump’s exemption from 100% tariffs on semiconductors for those with investments in U.S. production means trade partners may be able to use investments as a bargaining chip. Taiwan's Taiex jumped 2.4% as shares in market heavyweight Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. surged 4.9%. TSMC is the world's largest contract maker of computer chips and it has been ramping up its investments in U.S. factory capacity, helping to alleviate the impact from higher tariffs. South Korean chipmakers also saw strong gains, with Samsung Electronics jumping 2.1% after the government said its products would also be subject to the exemption. On Wednesday, a rally for Apple led Wall Street higher, with U.S. stocks reclaiming more of their sharp losses from last week. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% to 6,345.06. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2% to 44,193.12, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 1.2% to 21,169.42. Apple alone accounted for more than a third of the S&P 500’s gain. Trading elsewhere on Wall Street was mixed following a jumble of profit reports. McDonald’s and Shopify rose following their latest updates, while Super Micro Computer tumbled after its earnings and revenue came in below analysts’ expectations.

How India ended up facing steep US tariffs despite its strategic partnership,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/how-india-ended-up-facing-steep-us-tariffs-despite-its-strategic-partnership-2025-08-07/,"NEW DELHI (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed additional 25% tariff on India for its purchases of Russian oil, bringing the combined tariffs imposed by the United States on its ally to 50%. India has called the additional tariffs “unfortunate.” Trump's Wednesday announcement came as India and the U.S. are still negotiating a trade deal that has faced roadblocks after it was first announced when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Trump in Washington earlier this year. It also comes at a time when ties between India and the U.S. appear to have taken a hit even as Modi and Trump share a warm relationship. Here is how India, a strategic partner of the U.S. in Asia, ended up facing steep tariffs: Trump imposes tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. He initially spares India, despite repeatedly calling the country a “tariff king,"" but threatens that high tariffs are coming. Modi meets Trump in Washington in an effort to resolve trade concerns. Trump again warns of higher U.S. tariffs on Indian goods. India and the U.S. agree to work on a trade deal and expand bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. They don't share details as to how the target would be achieved. Modi says he expects a deal to be completed later this year. India’s trade minister, Piyush Goyal, visits Washington and meets his counterparts to initiate negotiations for the bilateral trade agreement. U.S. Vice President JD Vance meets Modi in New Delhi and says both sides are making progress on trade talks. India and the U.S. also finalize the terms of reference for the trade negotiation, bringing them a step closer to an agreement. Trump says he stopped military hostilities between India and Pakistan by offering possible trade concessions to both. India is angered by Trump’s claims and disputes them. Trade minister Goyal leads a team of senior Indian officials to Washington for more negotiations. India’s commerce secretary says the proposed bilateral trade agreement is progressing “very well.” Trump signals a deal may be close. “We’re having some great deals. We have one coming up, maybe with India, a very big one, where we’re going to open up India,” he says. An Indian trade delegation visits Washington for another round of discussions, which end without reaching a breakthrough. Goyal says India is ready to make trade deals in “the national interest,” but not just to meet deadlines. Trump imposes 25% tariffs on Indian imports. He warns of further penalties for India because of its buying of Russian oil, and calls its economy “dead.” Trump vows an additional 25% import taxes on India to punish the country for its purchases of Russian oil, bringing combined tariffs to 50%.

New US tariffs cloud outlook for exporters in Asia and beyond,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/new-us-tariffs-cloud-outlook-for-exporters-in-asia-and-beyond-2025-08-07/,"BANGKOK (AP) — President Donald Trump’s new tariff rates on U.S. imports from dozens of countries took effect Thursday, the latest chapter in the saga of Trump’s reshaping of global trade. But many questions remain. Trump has threatened tariffs of up to 200% on imports of pharmaceuticals and has ordered a 100% import tax on computer chips. Most U.S. imports of copper, steel and aluminum are subject to a 50% tariff. There’s still no agreement on what tariffs might apply to products shipped from China. India has no deal yet and faces a potential 50% tariff as Trump pressures it to stop buying oil from Russia. Recent data shows uncertainty is clouding the outlook for exporters around the world as a rush to beat the tariffs during a pause for negotiation tapers off. Companies are reporting billions of dollars in higher costs or losses due to the higher import duties. Global financial markets took Thursday's tariff adjustments in stride, with Asian shares and U.S. futures mostly higher. Here's where things stand in what has proven to be a fast-changing policy landscape. The tariffs announced on Aug. 1 apply to 66 countries, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands. They are a revised version of what Trump called "" reciprocal tariffs,"" announced on April 2: import taxes of up to 50% on goods from countries that have a trade surplus with the United States, along with 10% “baseline’’ taxes on almost everyone else. That move triggered sell-offs in financial markets and Trump backtracked to allow time for trade talks. The president has bypassed Congress, which has authority over taxes, by invoking a 1977 law to declare the trade deficit a national emergency. That's being challenged in court, but the revised tariffs still took effect. To keep their access to the huge American market, major trading partners have struck deals with Trump. The United Kingdom agreed to 10% tariffs and the European Union, South Korea and Japan accepted U.S. tariffs of 15%. Those are much higher than the low single-digit rates they paid last year, but down from the 30% Trump had ordered for the EU and the 25% he ordered for Japan. Countries in Africa and Asia are mostly facing lower rates than the ones Trump decreed in April. Thailand, Pakistan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines cut deals with Trump, settling for rates of around 20%. Indonesia views its 19% tariff deal as a leg up against exporters in other countries that will have to pay slightly more, said Fithra Faisal Hastiadi, a spokesperson in the Indonesian president's office. “We were competing against Vietnam, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and China ... and they are all subject to higher reciprocal tariffs,” Hastiadi said. “We believe we will stay competitive.” Trump has yet to announce whether he will extend an Aug. 12 deadline for reaching a trade agreement with China that would forestall earlier threats of tariffs of up to 245%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the president is deciding about another 90-day delay to allow time to work out details of an agreement setting tariffs on most products at 50%, including extra import duties related to illicit trade in fentanyl. Higher import taxes on small parcels from China have hurt smaller factories and layoffs have accelerated, leaving some 200 million workers reliant on “flexible work” — the gig economy — for their livelihoods, the government estimates. India also has no broad trade agreement with Trump. On Wednesday, Trump he signed an executive order placing an extra 25% tariff for its purchases of Russian oil, bringing combined U.S. tariffs to 50%. India's Foreign Ministry has stood firm, saying it began importing oil from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict, a “necessity compelled by the global market situation.” Struggling, impoverished Laos and war-torn Myanmar and Syria face 40-41% rates. Trump whacked Brazil with a 50% import tax largely because he’s unhappy with its treatment of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. South Africa said the steep 30% rate Trump has ordered on the exporter of precious gems and metals has put 30,000 jobs at risk and left the country scrambling to find new markets outside the United States. Even wealthy Switzerland is under the gun. Swiss officials were visiting Washington this week to try to stave off a whopping 39% tariff on U.S. imports of its chocolate, watches and other products. The rate is over 2 1/2 times the 15% rate on European Union goods exported to the United States. Goods that comply with the 2020 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump negotiated during his first term are excluded from the tariffs. Even though U.S. neighbor and ally Canada was hit by a 35% tariff after it defied Trump, a staunch supporter of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, by saying it would recognize a Palestinian state, nearly all of its exports to the U.S. remain duty free. Canada’s central bank says 100% of energy exports and 95% of other exports are compliant with the agreement since regional rules mean Canadian and Mexico companies can claim preferential treatment. The slice of Mexican exports not covered by the USMCA is subject to a 25% tariff, down from an earlier rate of 30%, during a 90-day negotiating period that began last week. Surveys of factory managers offer monthly insights into export orders, hiring and other indicators of how businesses are faring. The latest figures in the United States and globally mostly showed conditions deteriorating. In Japan, factory output contracted in July, purchasing activity fell and hiring slowed, according to the S&P Global Manufacturing PMI. But the data were collected before Trump announced a trade deal that cut tariffs on Japanese exports to 15% from 25%. Similar surveys show a deterioration in manufacturing conditions worldwide, as a boost from “front loading” export orders to beat higher tariffs faded, S&P Global said. Similar measures for service industries have remained stronger, reflecting more domestic business activity. In Asia, that includes a rebound in tourism across the region. Corporate bottom lines are also taking a hit. Honda Motor said Wednesday that it estimates the cost from higher tariffs at about $3 billion. On top that, the U.S. economy — Trump's trump card as the world's biggest market — is starting to show pain from months of tariff threats. ___ Associated Press writer Niniek Karmini in Jakarta and Aniruddha Ghosal in Hanoi contributed.","They are a revised version of what Trump called "" reciprocal tariffs,"" announced on April 2: import taxes of up to 50% on goods from countries that have a trade surplus with the United States, along with 10% “baseline’’ taxes on almost everyone else.","They are a revised version of what Trump called "" reciprocal tariffs,"" announced on April 2: import taxes of up to 50% on goods from countries that have a trade surplus with the United States, along with 10% “baseline’’ taxes on almost everyone else.",India has no deal yet and faces a potential 50% tariff as Trump pressures it to stop buying oil from Russia.,"South Africa said the steep 30% rate Trump has ordered on the exporter of precious gems and metals has put 30,000 jobs at risk and left the country scrambling to find new markets outside the United States.",negative,0.9685875177383423
Sony raises its profit forecast after saying it expects less damage from Trump's tariffs,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/sony-raises-its-profit-forecast-after-saying-it-expects-less-damage-from-trumps-tariffs-2025-08-07/,"TOKYO (AP) — Japanese entertainment and electronics company Sony said Thursday that its profit surged 23% in the last quarter from the year before, as damage from U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs was less than it had expected. The Tokyo-based manufacturer reported its April-June profit totaled 259 billion yen, or $1.8 billion, up from 210 billion yen. Quarterly sales edged up 2% to 2.6 trillion yen ($17.7 billion) as demand grew for games and network services, imaging solutions and sensors. The maker of PlayStation game machines, digital cameras, Walkman audio players and Spider-Man movies said those positive factors offset the negative impact from unfavorable exchanges rates. Sony said its network business also was drawing more subscribers to its online services. Sony raised its forecast for its profit in the full fiscal year until March 2026 to 970 billion yen ($6.6 billion), from an earlier forecast of 930 billion yen ($6.3 billion). The revised projection is still lower than what it earned in the previous fiscal year at 1 trillion yen. Sony now estimates the impact of the additional U.S. tariffs on its operating income at 70 billion yen ($476 million), much better than the initial estimate of 100 billion yen ($680 million). One of the successes among Sony's entertainment franchises was the latest “Demon Slayer” animation movie, which is part of a hit series and is doing well at the box office. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on Threads: https://www.threads.com/@yurikageyama","Sony raised its forecast for its profit in the full fiscal year until March 2026 to 970 billion yen ($6.6 billion), from an earlier forecast of 930 billion yen ($6.3 billion).","Sony raised its forecast for its profit in the full fiscal year until March 2026 to 970 billion yen ($6.6 billion), from an earlier forecast of 930 billion yen ($6.3 billion).","TOKYO (AP) — Japanese entertainment and electronics company Sony said Thursday that its profit surged 23% in the last quarter from the year before, as damage from U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs was less than it had expected.","Sony now estimates the impact of the additional U.S. tariffs on its operating income at 70 billion yen ($476 million), much better than the initial estimate of 100 billion yen ($680 million).",positive,0.9445533156394958
RSI Stock Soars 22% On Q2 Blowout—Will PENN Match the Momentum?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/rsi-stock-soars-22-after-q2-blowoutwill-penn-match-the-momentum/,"Online casino and sports betting firm Rush Street Interactive Inc. NYSE: RSI has been one of the biggest surprises of the second-quarter earnings period. The company's impressive earnings report sent shares skyrocketing by nearly 22% in the span of just five days. With major wins for both Rush Street's online casino business and its sports betting operations, the company seems poised for continued growth going forward. Beyond the implications of a strong quarter for Rush Street in particular, however, is the suggestion that this could be the first of several online casino names to win this earnings season. Indeed, advances in AI and user experience, growing certainty surrounding regulations, the rise of data-driven personalization of casino experiences, and a customer shift toward a younger demographic may all be contributing to a noteworthy moment for online gaming companies. As major competitors like PENN Entertainment Inc. NASDAQ: PENN deliver their most recent quarterly updates, investors will get a clearer picture of whether Rush Street was an indicator of wins for the industry as a whole or a standout player on its own. Before comparing RSI to others in the space, it’s important to understand the full scope of Rush Street's recent earnings win. The company's revenue grew by 22% year-over-year (YOY), reaching record levels, while its EBITDA jumped by an impressive 88% over the same period. These gains were driven by 25% and 15% increases, respectively, in revenue from the firm's online casino and sports betting segments. Rush Street's global popularity is expanding, as the company saw a YOY surge in monthly active users (MAUs) in North America (30%) as well as Latin America (40%). While it was growing at a rapid pace, Rush Street also managed to stay debt-free and continue building its stockpile of $241 million in cash reserves. The company expects slightly more modest full-year revenue and EBITDA growth of 16% and 51%, respectively, as it raised its full-year guidance. Analysts are largely bullish on Rush Street, as eight out of 10 rated RSI a Buy, despite the fact that the recent rally sent the stock price just above the consensus price target of around $18 per share. Despite being just over half the size of Rush Street, PENN Entertainment's smaller size, the company is expanding rapidly. It has multiple growth projects in development for the next several quarters, including a land-based casino planned in Iowa valued at up to $200 million. On the digital front, PENN continues to invest in its iCasino and online sports betting offerings, particularly after its acquisition of theScore and strategic pivot away from Barstool Sportsbook. These moves aim to tighten integration across platforms and appeal to younger digital-first audiences. Its partnership with ESPN for ESPN BET has garnered attention but also heightened expectations. When PENN reports second-quarter earnings, investors will hope to see signs of continued progress on its multiple developments and, ideally, a strong improvement in top- and bottom-line performance. Despite some volatility in earnings performance in past quarters, the company’s liquidity remains strong, and it continues to execute on long-term growth plans. All told, though, analysts feel positively about PENN shares, with 11 out of 19 calling the company a Buy and setting a consensus price target suggesting about 33% in upside potential. Still, concerns persist around execution risk, brand differentiation in a crowded space, and the delayed payoff of long-term strategic bets. Rush Street’s Q2 performance shows that an online casino firm can deliver growth and profitability at scale, both domestically and internationally, with disciplined marketing and rising user value. With strong fundamentals and raised guidance, RSI is currently setting the pace in its segment. As investors await PENN’s upcoming earnings report on Aug. 7, the key question is whether it can mirror RSI’s momentum or forge a different path to growth through its hybrid land-based and digital strategy. PENN’s execution will be especially important given the competitive and evolving landscape. Notably, casino competitor DraftKings NASDAQ: DKNG reported a surprise slight earnings miss this quarter. Despite its scale and dominant sportsbook footprint, the company reported an EPS of 38 cents, slightly short of the analyst expectations of 41 cents. That miss raises the possibility that RSI’s performance isn’t just a rising tide lifting all boats, but rather a sign of company-specific outperformance. It also puts added pressure on PENN to demonstrate clear strategic gains. All told, RSI's breakout quarter could be a turning point for investor confidence in mid-tier digital gaming firms, especially if PENN can validate the trend. But if PENN underwhelms, it may reinforce the notion that Rush Street is the outlier, not the bellwether.

"Trump's broad tariffs go into effect, just as economic pain is surfacing",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trumps-broad-tariffs-go-into-effect-just-as-economic-pain-is-surfacing-2025-08-06/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump was set to officially begin levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to create visible damage for the U.S. economy. The White House said that starting just after midnight that goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union would face tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea will be taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh will be taxed at 20%. For places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea, Trump also expects them to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. “I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,” Trump said Wednesday afternoon. He added that the U.S. was “taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs,” but he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because “we don’t even know what the final number is” regarding tariff rates. Despite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes they can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power. But so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with Trump’s initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday. After April, economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. “A less productive economy requires fewer workers,” Silvia said in an analysis note. “But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.” Even then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly. “We all want it to be made for television where it’s this explosion — it’s not like that,” said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. “It’s going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.” Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year, and the factory jobs promised by Trump have so far resulted in job losses. The lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. The process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 said the higher tax rates would start in seven days. On Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. Trump on Wednesday announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India for its buying of Russian oil, bringing their total import taxes to 50%. He has said that import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs and announced 100% tariffs on computer chips, meaning the U.S. economy could remain in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impact. The president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also under challenge. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority. Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. “There’s no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,” Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. “I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they’re going to have some legal challenges.” Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. As of now, Trump still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. “There’s one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he’s creating, and that’s Donald Trump,” said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. “The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.”","Most Americans get more than half their calories from ultra-processed foods, those super-tasty, energy-dense foods typically full of sugar, salt and unhealthy fats, according to a new federal report.","One small but influential study found that even when diets were matched for calories, sugar, fat, fiber and micronutrients, people consumed more calories and gained more weight when they ate ultra-processed foods than when they ate minimally processed foods.","For instance, instead of instant oatmeal that may contain added sugar, sodium, artificial colors and preservatives, use plain oats sweetened with honey or maple syrup.","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Agriculture Department recently issued a request for information to develop a new, uniform definition of ultra-processed foods for products in the U.S. food supply.",neutral,0.7544315457344055
"Americans get more than half their calories from ultra-processed foods, CDC report says",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/americans-get-more-than-half-their-calories-from-ultraprocessed-foods-cdc-report-says-2025-08-06/,"Most Americans get more than half their calories from ultra-processed foods, those super-tasty, energy-dense foods typically full of sugar, salt and unhealthy fats, according to a new federal report. Nutrition research has shown for years that ultra-processed foods make up a big chunk of the U.S. diet, especially for kids and teens. For the first time, however, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed those high levels of consumption, using dietary data collected from August 2021 to August 2023. The report comes amid growing scrutiny of such foods by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who blames them for causing chronic disease. “We are poisoning ourselves and it's coming principally from these ultra-processed foods,” Kennedy told Fox News earlier this year. Overall, about 55% of total calories consumed by Americans age 1 and older came from ultra-processed foods during that period, according to the report. For adults, ultra-processed foods made up about 53% of total calories consumed, but for kids through age 18, it was nearly 62%. The top sources included burgers and sandwiches, sweet baked goods, savory snacks, pizza and sweetened drinks. Young children consumed fewer calories from ultra-processed foods than older kids, the report found. Adults 60 and older consumed fewer calories from those sources than younger adults. Low-income adults consumed more ultra-processed foods than those with higher incomes. The results were not surprising, said co-author Anne Williams, a CDC nutrition expert. What was surprising was that consumption of ultra-processed foods appeared to dip slightly over the past decade. Among adults, total calories from those sources fell from about 56% in 2013-2014 and from nearly 66% for kids in 2017-2018. Williams said she couldn't speculate about the reason for the decline or whether consumption of less processed foods increased. But Andrea Deierlein, a nutrition expert at New York University who was not involved in the research, suggested that there may be greater awareness of the potential harms of ultra-processed foods. “People are trying, at least in some populations, to decrease their intakes of these foods,” she said. Concern over ultra-processed foods' health effects has been growing for years, but finding solutions has been difficult. Many studies have linked them to obesity, diabetes and heart disease, but they haven't been able to prove that the foods directly cause those chronic health problems. One small but influential study found that even when diets were matched for calories, sugar, fat, fiber and micronutrients, people consumed more calories and gained more weight when they ate ultra-processed foods than when they ate minimally processed foods. Research published this week in the journal Nature found that participants in a clinical trial lost twice as much weight when they ate minimally processed foods — such as pasta, chicken, fruits and vegetables — than ultra-processed foods, even those matched for nutrition components and considered healthy, such as ready-to-heat frozen meals, protein bars and shakes. Part of the problem is simply defining ultra-processed foods. The new CDC report used the most common definition based on the four-tier Nova system developed by Brazilian researchers that classifies foods according to the amount of processing they undergo. Such foods tend to be “hyperpalatable, energy-dense, low in dietary fiber and contain little or no whole foods, while having high amounts of salt, sweeteners and unhealthy fats,” the CDC report said. U.S. health officials recently said there are concerns over whether current definitions “accurately capture” the range of foods that may affect health. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Agriculture Department recently issued a request for information to develop a new, uniform definition of ultra-processed foods for products in the U.S. food supply. In the meantime, Americans should try to reduce ultra-processed foods in their daily diets, Deierlein said. For instance, instead of instant oatmeal that may contain added sugar, sodium, artificial colors and preservatives, use plain oats sweetened with honey or maple syrup. Read food packages and nutrition information, she suggested. “I do think that there are less-processed options available for many foods,” she said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

An alert on the Federal Aviation Administration website said all United flights destined for Chicago were halted at their departing airports. The agency said Denver, Newark, Houston and San Francisco airports were also impacted by halted flights. “Safety is our top priority, and we’ll work with our customers to get them to their destinations,” an emailed statement from the Chicago based-airline said. A statement Wednesday night said the underlying technology issue had been resolved and employees were working to restore normal operations. The impacted system, called Unimatic, houses flight information that is fed to other systems including those that calculate weight and balance and track flight times, according to United. The system outage, as the company described it, lasted several hours, the statement said. It wasn't related to recent concerns about airline industry cybersecurity.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the federal government needs to prepare for that to happen this fall. Ford made the comments after the country’s provincial premiers and Prime Minister Mark Carney met in private for the first time since Trump escalated his trade war by hitting Canada with a baseline 35% tariff last week. The new tariff, which took effect on Friday after the two countries failed to hit an Aug. 1 deadline to secure a new trade agreement, applies only to goods not covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump negotiated during his first term. Trump previously hailed the agreement as “the fairest, most balanced and beneficial trade agreement we have ever signed. "" Carney has said about 85% of trade with the U.S. remains tariff-free because of USMCA. Ford said Trump likely won’t wait for the scheduled review of the agreement next year. “He’s not waiting until 2026. At any given time, President Trump — not that he even follows the rules — he can pull the carpet out from underneath us,” Ford told reporters in Toronto Wednesday. “I’m going to ask the people, do you trust President Trump? I don’t.” Carney told a press conference on Tuesday that he has not talked to Trump in recent days but would speak with him “when it makes sense.” Sector-specific tariffs on Canada, like the 50% duty on steel, aluminum and copper, remain in place.

The 10-stamp series announced on Thursday celebrates some of the troupe’s most iconic characters and catchphrases, from “Nudge, nudge” to “The Lumberjack Song.” Six stamps depict scenes from the sketch-comedy TV series “Monty Python’s Flying Circus,” including “The Spanish Inquisition,” ”The Ministry of Silly Walks,"" “Dead Parrot” and “The Nude Organist.” Another four mark the 50th anniversary of the cult classic 1975 film “Monty Python and the Holy Grail,” including one showing the limb-losing Black Knight insisting, “’Tis but a scratch.” The stamps can be pre-ordered from Thursday and go on sale Aug. 14.

The troupe also made several feature films, including “And Now for Something Completely Different,” “Monty Python’s Life of Brian” and “Monty Python’s The Meaning of Life.” David Gold, Royal Mail’s director of external affairs, said the collection “honors a body of work that has shaped the comedic landscape for nearly six decades.” Palin said he was “very glad to share a stamp with the nude organist!” The group largely disbanded in the 1980s, and Chapman died of cancer in 1989.

How DigitalOcean's Focus Is Fueling Explosive Growth,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/how-digitaloceans-focus-is-fueling-explosive-growth/,"In the world of cloud computing, a market famously dominated by tech titans like Amazon NASDAQ: AMZN, Microsoft NASDAQ: MSFT, and Google NASDAQ: GOOG, it’s easy to assume there is little room for smaller players. Their immense scale and sprawling service catalogs often define the conversation. However, a recent, powerful market signal suggests a different story is unfolding. DigitalOcean Holdings, Inc. NYSE: DOCN, a niche cloud provider with a fraction of the giants' resources, saw its stock price jump by nearly 29% in a single day after releasing its quarterly earnings. This dramatic move begs a critical question for investors: How is a specialized company not only competing but achieving such decisive success? The answer is found in a disciplined and focused strategy that is now firing on all cylinders. The immediate trigger for DigitalOcean’s impressive stock performance was a second-quarter 2025 financial report that confidently beat analyst expectations and signaled business health. For investors, the results were a clear indication of a company executing its plan with remarkable efficiency. For the quarter ending June 30, 2025, DigitalOcean delivered a potent combination of growth and profitability: Beyond looking in the rearview mirror, DigitalOcean’s management provided a forward-looking outlook that strengthened investor confidence. The company raised its guidance for the full 2025 fiscal year, now projecting total revenue between $888 million and $892 million and an upgraded non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.05 to $2.10. An upward revision of this nature is one of the strongest signals management can send, suggesting they see sustained momentum and a clear path to achieving their operational goals for the rest of the year. DigitalOcean's success is the result of a deliberate strategy to dominate a specific and valuable niche: the market for individual developers, startups, and small-to-medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that value simplicity above all else. Where hyperscalers offer complexity and an overwhelming array of services, DigitalOcean provides a streamlined experience, transparent pricing, and extensive community support. The latest financial data proves this model is not just viable; it's highly profitable. The most compelling evidence lies in the company’s ability to grow with its customers. Revenue from its “Builders” clients (those spending over $500 monthly) grew by an impressive 35% year-over-year. This metric is crucial because it validates the company's land-and-expand model: customers start with small projects and, thanks to the platform's ease of use, confidently scale their operations and spending over time. This targeted approach translates directly into a healthy and efficient business, as shown by the $57 million in adjusted free cash flow generated during the quarter. Furthermore, two key customer metrics highlight the strategy's success: With its core business executing so well, DigitalOcean is applying its proven philosophy of simplification to the next significant technology shift: artificial intelligence (AI). The company is strategically positioning itself to win the equally important race of making AI accessible and useful for its core customer base. Its focus is on AI inference (the practical use of models in applications), which is widely expected to be a larger long-term market than model training. The company’s AI revenue is more than doubling year-over-year, which is a clear sign that this approach is working. This growth is being propelled by specific product initiatives designed to remove friction for developers: By focusing on the application layer, DigitalOcean is turning AI from a complex, infrastructure-heavy challenge into a simple, integrated tool, reinforcing its value proposition to developers. DigitalOcean's powerful second-quarter performance is validation of a business model built for a specific purpose. The company has demonstrated its ability to carve out a profitable, high-growth niche in a competitive market by remaining disciplined and focused on the needs of its customers. The path forward appears clear and compelling. The core business is healthy and growing, while the company's focused AI strategy provides a significant catalyst for future expansion. Reinforcing this positive outlook is the prudent financial management demonstrated by the leadership team. By proactively securing a new $800 million credit facility to refinance its future debt obligations, the company is ensuring it has a strong and stable financial foundation from which to pursue its growth ambitions. For investors seeking exposure to the cloud and AI sectors through a company with a proven strategy and a clear runway for growth, DigitalOcean presents a compelling and well-defined case.

"Trump plans 100% tariff on computer chips, unless companies build in US",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-says-he-plans-to-put-a-100-tariff-on-computer-chips-likely-pushing-up-cost-of-electronics-2025-08-06/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he will impose a 100% tariff on computer chips, raising the specter of higher prices for electronics, autos, household appliances and other essential products dependent on the processors powering the digital age. “We’ll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors,” Trump said in the Oval Office while meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook. ""But if you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no charge."" The announcement came more than three months after Trump temporarily exempted most electronics from his administration's most onerous tariffs. The Republican president said companies that make computer chips in the U.S. would be spared the import tax. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage of computer chips increased the price of autos and contributed to higher inflation. Investors seemed to interpret the potential tariff exemptions as a positive for Apple and other major tech companies that have been making huge financial commitments to manufacture more chips and other components in the U.S.. Big Tech already has made collective commitments to invest about $1.5 trillion in the U.S. since Trump moved back into the White House in January. That figure includes a $600 billion promise from Apple after the iPhone maker boosted its commitment by tacking another $100 billion on to a previous commitment made in February. Now the question is whether the deal brokered between Cook and Trump will be enough to insulate the millions of iPhones made in China and India from the tariffs that the administration has already imposed and reduce the pressure on the company to raise prices on the new models expected to be unveiled next month. Wall Street certainly seems to think so. After Apple's stock price gained 5% in Wednesday regular trading sessions, the shares rose by another 3% in extended trading after Trump announced some tech companies won't be hit with the latest tariffs while Cook stood alongside him. The shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia, which also has recently made big commitments to the U.S., rose slightly in extended trading to add to the $1 trillion gain in market value the Silicon Valley company has made since the start of Trump's second administration. The stock price of computer chip pioneer Intel, which has fallen on hard times, also climbed in extended trading. Inquiries sent to chip makers Nvidia and Intel were not immediately answered. The chip industry's main trade group, the Semiconductor Industry Association, declined to comment on Trump's latest tariffs. Demand for computer chips has been climbing worldwide, with sales increasing 19.6% in the year-ended in June, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organization. Trump's tariff threats mark a significant break from existing plans to revive computer chip production in the U.S. that were drawn up during the administration of President Joe Biden. Since taking over from Biden, Trump has been deploying tariffs to incentivize more domestic production. Essentially, the president is betting that the threat of dramatically higher chip costs would force most companies to open factories domestically, despite the risk that tariffs could squeeze corporate profits and push up prices for mobile phones, TVs and refrigerators. By contrast, the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act that Biden signed into law in 2022 provided more than $50 billion to support new computer chip plants, fund research and train workers for the industry. The mix of funding support, tax credits and other financial incentives were meant to draw in private investment, a strategy that Trump has vocally opposed. — Liedtke reported from San Ramon, California.","First, Wall Street analysts are set on a forecast for $0.24 in earnings per share (EPS) for the third quarter of 2025, a jump of 33.3% from today’s reported 18 cents in EPS.","The other side to this coin is that the price is now low enough to have priced in some of these bearish expectations, creating a much better risk-to-reward ratio and probability setup for those willing to buy the dip and keep riding on the company’s momentum, which has seemed unstoppable over the past year.","Overall, it seems that the potential range to be had on Celsius hovers between $54 and $57 per share, giving investors a shot at not only double-digit upside but also new 52-week highs.","The other side to this coin is that the price is now low enough to have priced in some of these bearish expectations, creating a much better risk-to-reward ratio and probability setup for those willing to buy the dip and keep riding on the company’s momentum, which has seemed unstoppable over the past year.",neutral,0.918982982635498
Can Celsius Stock Keep Its Momentum Going Any Longer?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/can-celsius-stock-keep-its-momentum-going-any-longer/,"Following a recent rally of 20.5%, shares of Celsius Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: CELH are gaining popularity again, especially as the stock reaches 90% of its 52-week high and shows enough momentum to potentially push investors toward a new peak for the year. However, there is one major speed bump standing in the way of today’s price and that higher promise. That earnings uncertainty acts as a speed bump for the company’s quarter, as Celsius stock has fallen about 5% in a week just before the upcoming release on August 7, 2025. This behavior can usually be perceived in two different ways, and the first, being the most common, is that the market is expecting some disappointing results from Celsius. The other side to this coin is that the price is now low enough to have priced in some of these bearish expectations, creating a much better risk-to-reward ratio and probability setup for those willing to buy the dip and keep riding on the company’s momentum, which has seemed unstoppable over the past year. Here are some reasons Celsius might make it out okay after earnings. Wall Street analysts rarely give their ratings and valuation targets right before a stock announces quarterly earnings, which is why investors should see the upcoming wave of upgrades in late July 2025 as a sign of confidence heading into the results. While the consensus rating for Celsius stock stands at a Moderate Buy, along with a price target of $47.8 per share, a few analysts were willing to break the mold. Filippo Falorni sees a Buy rating and a $55 per share valuation on Celsius to call for 31% upside potential from today’s prices. Falorni wasn’t alone in this, as Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan Chase & Co. followed suit with her Overweight view and $54 per share target price, roughly in line with Citigroup’s view. Overall, it seems that the potential range to be had on Celsius hovers between $54 and $57 per share, giving investors a shot at not only double-digit upside but also new 52-week highs. If the company can deliver on this, it shouldn’t be surprising to see some institutional buyers step in as well, since most of them use a momentum strategy supported by the right fundamental story. However, while that part of the picture is still uncertain, there is some additional evidence to consider about Celsius beforehand. Over the past month, 13.8% of Celsius stock’s short interest was wiped out of the picture in a clear sign of bearish capitulation. More than that, there is still $976.6 million worth of open short positions. If the stock can deliver a decent quarter and break through to these Wall Street targets, chances are those may be closed out, too. Closing a short position indirectly adds more buying pressure to a stock since it involves buying back the stock short sellers borrowed to sell in the first place. Now, other fundamental factors are at play here that could very well push Celsius toward those new highs. First, Wall Street analysts are set on a forecast for $0.24 in earnings per share (EPS) for the third quarter of 2025, a jump of 33.3% from today’s reported 18 cents in EPS. Knowing that EPS growth is the typical driver behind a stock’s upside, this view matches perfectly with the percentage upside expected from valuation targets. Looking at the last quarterly earnings, there is one clear theme that investors should keep in mind and look for in the upcoming quarterly announcement. Celsius reported a 1.15% increase in its gross margin despite a 7% decline in revenue, and the reason why is all that matters. As the brand and company expand into more international markets, its economies of scale allow it to spread costs across different operations and thus make it more efficient. Considering the bulk of revenue contraction occurred in the United States, possibly due to spreading tariff fears in the consumer discretionary sector, this should already be factored in. Moving forward, a more confident consumer in the United States could push that revenue figure for North America higher, building on top of the 41% revenue growth seen in the international segment. With all these tailwinds in mind, backing the expected upside and EPS growth, there is one last factor to consider here. Markets are now willing to pay up to 132.6x in a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for Celsius stock, a long way above the rest of the industry’s 18.1x average. The market’s pricing mechanism is always willing to place a premium on those companies that can outgrow their peers and the broader S&P 500, and this time, Celsius justifies that premium.

Disney’s Iger-Led Turnaround Gains Traction,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/disneys-iger-led-turnaround-gains-traction/,"The Walt Disney Company NYSE: DIS faces headwinds in 2025, as do most businesses, but the Q2 results reveal the enduring strength of the brand and the impact of Bob Iger’s return. While revenue headwinds persist for this entertainment company, the company continues to grow, and profitability is improving. The critical detail is that profitability improved across key operating metrics, driving a significant bottom-line outperformance despite the tepid top-line. The takeaway for investors is that this company has regained its lost leverage, is well-positioned for an economic rebound, and the capital return outlook is rapidly improving. Disney’s stock price action declined following the FQ3 release, setting it up to rally as the calendar quarter progresses. The move took the market to a critical support level that aligns with prior resistance and key moving averages, and support appears to be present. The market may consolidate at this level, but assuming no new low is set, a new high is likely to occur soon. The moving averages have formed a Golden Crossover, indicating a shift in market dynamics from a less-bullish to a more-bullish posture, which is a signal to buy. Disney didn’t have an easy time in Q2, but its diversified business model and refocus on quality are paying off. The $23.65 billion in net revenue is up 2.1% compared to last year, with strength in Entertainment and Experiences offsetting Sports. Entertainment grew by only 1%, led by an 8% increase in Experiences and offset by a 5% decline in Sports. Within the Entertainment segment, DTC and licensing are the standouts, while in Experiences, the domestic parks led the strength. The only bad news is that the analysts had been expecting a little more. The margin news is also mixed, with one segment contracting and the others expanding. The net result is that EBIT grew by 4%, segment operating income by 8%, adjusted earnings by 16%, cash from operations by 41%, and free cash flow by 51%, with adjusted earnings outpacing the consensus by nearly 1200 basis points. The guidance echoes the clear sign of strength, which is why this stock is a buy in Q3. Given the underlying strengths, the company raised its full-year profit targets to a range above the consensus and may exceed the target. The focus on streaming and sports is a reason to bet on Disney’s long-term stock price recovery. The company is integrating Hulu and Disney+, making it a more attractive and comprehensive streaming solution, and rationalizing its ESPS networks. ESPN's focus includes acquiring the NFL’s media assets and integrating them into the streaming portfolio. Bob Iger’s impact on the business is visible in the balance sheet. Highlights include reduced cash, which is balanced by steady assets, decreased debt and total liabilities, and a 7% rise in equity. The increase in equity is especially significant considering the share buybacks, which lowered the share count by 1.2%, effectively using cash while increasing shareholder value. The buybacks and dividend payments are expected to continue steadily through the end of the year and into next year. The dividend remains reliable at less than 20% of forecasted earnings and is expected to rise in 2026. The analyst and institutions are bullish on Disney’s turnaround and capital return. The 24 analysts tracked by MarketBeat rate the stock as Moderate Buy with bullish bias, see it advancing to a multiyear high in 2025, and the institutions are buying on balance. The institutional activity provides a strong tailwind for the market, owning 66% of the stock and buying at a two-to-one pace in Q3.

FDA flags problems with two Boston Scientific heart devices tied to injuries and deaths,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/fda-flags-problems-with-two-boston-scientific-heart-devices-tied-to-injuries-and-deaths-2025-08-06/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. health regulators are warning doctors and patients about safety issues with two separate Boston Scientific heart devices recently linked to injuries and deaths. The Food and Drug Administration issued two alerts Wednesday about electrical problems tied to the company's heart-zapping defibrillator systems and a separate issue with a heart implant used to reduce stroke risk. The agency said some of the company's Endotak Reliance defibrillator wires can become calcified, leading to failures in delivering life-saving shocks to the heart, according to the FDA. Defibrillators are surgically placed in the upper chest, where they monitor irregular heartbeats and use electrical shocks to jolt the heart back to normal. As of July 24, Boston Scientific has reported 386 serious injuries and 16 deaths associated with this issue, the agency said. Ten of the deaths were judged to be due to the device failing to function properly, the company said in an email. Four were linked to attempts to surgically remove the devices from patients and two others were deemed unrelated to the implants. Boston Scientific's wires were distributed between 2002 and 2021 and are no longer available, the company noted in its letter to doctors. Some patients will need to have the devices replaced, though physicians should weigh the risks of the removal procedure. In a separate notice, the FDA said Boston Scientific recently updated instructions for implanting its Watchman device, which closes a portion of the heart's left atrium to reduce the risk of stroke. In a letter to physicians, the company noted that there is an increased risk of blockages in the bloodstream depending on the level of anesthesia for patients undergoing the initial implantation procedure. Watchman is an alternative to long-term treatment with blood thinners for patients at increased risk of stroke. As of July 30, the company has reported 120 serious injuries and 17 deaths related to the issue, the FDA said. A company investigation concluded that the safety issue “is not associated with the design or manufacture of any component of the Watchman system. Heart devices, including defibrillators and other implants, are Boston Scientific’s largest business, making up two-thirds of its $5 billion in revenue for the most recent quarter. Shares of Boston Scientific Corp. fell nearly 1.8 percent Wednesday to close at $102.95 in trading. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

"Joby Deal Gives Blade New Direction, But Stock Lacks Lift",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/joby-deal-gives-blade-new-direction-but-stock-lacks-lift/,"It’s been quite the week for Blade Air Mobility Inc. NASDAQ: BLDE. On August 4, Blade and Joby Aviation Inc. NYSE: JOBY announced the sale of Blade’s passenger mobility business to Joby for up to $125 million. That sent BLDE stock soaring 30%. Blade will become a pure-play medical logistics company and change its name to Strata Critical Medical. However, the stock has given up most of those gains after the company delivered a mixed earnings report. Although it beat on the top line, it delivered negative earnings per share of five cents, which was a penny worse than the negative four cents analysts were expecting. The earnings report is a reminder that Blade has tremendous potential and serves a critical niche among business services stocks. However, the company is not yet profitable, and it may take some time for it to realize the economic benefits from the Joby deal. Blade Air Mobility operates as two divisions: Medical and Blade Passenger. The medical division is primarily comprised of its MediMobility Organ Transport business. The company is the largest dedicated air transporter of human organs for transplant in the United States. As of this quarter’s earnings, nearly 60% of the company’s revenue and 84% of its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) came from its medical division. In the quarter, Blade posted 18% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth from the medical division. This contrasts with the combined 8% YOY revenue decline in its short-distance and Jets business in the passenger division. The company’s earnings report was heavily focused on the impact of the Joby deal on Blade’s business. Management was bullish on the outlook, citing an expectation for “continued attractive organic growth over the coming years.” The company also said it plans to pursue strategic acquisitions with the expected $200 million of cash on hand, pro forma for selling its passenger business. In short, investors can expect a leaner company with more predictable cash flows, focused on non-emergency medical transport (NEMT), organ transfer, and time-critical healthcare logistics. As the company’s quarterly results bear out, this is a less volatile space compared to urban air travel. The sale of Blade’s passenger business to Joby is for “up to” $125 million. That’s because the sale will be paid entirely in Joby stock. On the company’s earnings call, Blade’s management didn’t express concern over Joby’s ability to deliver. That said, a deal based on a stock-based structure opens the possibility that Joby’s share price could impact Blade's final payout. This risk is somewhat amplified because Blade's chief executive officer (CEO), Rob Wiesenthal, remarked that the deal will close in the first half of 2026. That’s not an unusual timeline for a deal involving regulatory approvals. However, it does extend the runway for stock price volatility, particularly for a pre-revenue aviation startup like Joby. What Blade might be (i.e., a profitable, asset-light medical mobility company) is enticing. The company estimates the organ logistics market to be an addressable market worth about $1 billion, of which Blade already controls about 30%. But that’s not where the company is today. It’s also not what attracted some initial investors to the company. Those investors were attracted to the opportunity in air mobility. While the resulting company may offer stability and near-term profits, the upside will likely be capped. Until its passenger business is sold, investors should expect BLDE stock to reflect cautious optimism at best. However, it's likely to be choppy as traders look for opportunities for short-term gains.

Trump once hailed mRNA vaccines as a 'medical miracle.' Now RFK Jr. is halting advancement,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-once-hailed-mrna-vaccines-as-a-medical-miracle-now-rfk-jr-is-halting-advancement-2025-08-06/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump hailed as a “medical miracle” the mRNA vaccines developed to combat the deadly COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Now, his health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is effectively halting the vaccine technology’s advancement. Kennedy announced Tuesday that the federal government is canceling $500 million worth of mRNA research development contracts, putting an end to U.S.-backed hopes for the vaccine technology to prevent future pandemics, treat cancer or prevent flu infections. It's a sharp pivot from how Trump and top officials described the technology during his first term. Here's a look at what Trump and some of his closest advisers have said about mRNA vaccines that were credited with slowing the pandemic five years ago. “A COVID-19 vaccine is the thing that will get Americans back to normal everyday life,” said Redfield, in a Sept. 16, 2020, statement. Americans were still donning face masks as one of the few ways of protecting themselves from a virus that had killed nearly 200,000 in just over six months. Redfield promised that the new vaccines — developed for the first time using mRNA technology — would offer a return to normalcy. “Don’t let Joe Biden take credit for the vaccines ... because the vaccines were me, and I pushed people harder than they’ve ever been pushed before .. The vaccines are — there are those that say it’s one of the greatest things. It’s a medical miracle.” Trump said on Nov. 26, 2020, during a news conference in the White House. Weeks earlier, Trump had lost the election in a bitter race against Democrat Joe Biden. As the Republican grappled with leaving Washington and continued to plan for the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines, he reminded reporters that he oversaw the development of the new shots. “They say it’s somewhat of a miracle and I think that’s true,” Trump said on Dec. 8, 2020, during a speech at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. The event celebrated “Operation Warp Speed,"" the government-funded project that accelerated vaccine development with pharmaceutical companies. Trump was promoting the shots as the government prepared to offer them to frontline health workers. “It's clear that many Americans are learning these vaccines are safe and extraordinarily effective,” Azar said on Dec. 16, 2020, at a news conference. The government was shipping out mRNA vaccines to states, preparing to distributed it to the masses. Azar noted that a vast majority of Americans — between 70% to 80%, according to polls — intended to get the new COVID-19 vaccine that would be available to the public in the coming months. “It takes somewhere between five and 10 years to put a vaccine on the street. Look what we did. Now, that’s because of the great work of the scientists who had done the research on mRNA vaccines and others because of industry working on this, they just didn’t wake up one day and start working on it,” Perna said during a podcast interview that aired on May 9, 2023. Reflecting in an interview about his time overseeing “Operation Warp Speed,” Perna credited the mRNA technology with the government's ability to get shots in arms mere months after the pandemic started claiming lives in the U.S. in 2020. “Take credit because we saved tens of millions of lives. Take credit. Don’t let them take that away from you,” Trump said on Dec. 19, 2021 during a live interview with former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly. Daily COVID-19 deaths had ticked down to 1,500 compared to 3,000 from a year earlier after Americans began receiving their first doses of the mRNA vaccines. Trump revealed to O’Reilly and the audience that he had just gotten a COVID-19 booster. The crowd booed.","On Wednesday: The S&P 500 rose 45.87 points, or 0.7%, to 6,345.06.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.2%.",Trading elsewhere on Wall Street was mixed following a jumble of profit reports.,Apple alone accounted for more than a third of the S&P 500’s gain ahead of an announcement at the White House where it’s expected to increase its U.S. investments by an additional $100 billion over the next four years.,neutral,0.9058996438980103

More Than Yield: 5 Stocks Beating the Market and Hiking Dividends,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/more-than-yield-5-stocks-beating-the-market-and-hiking-dividends/,"While high dividend yields are enticing to many investors, the more relevant measurement of success of any stock is its total return. Total return includes a stock's dividend yield, as well as the change in share price. These two sources of return often work against each other; as shares fall, dividend yields rise, and vice versa. Below, we’ll detail five stocks that are working to deliver on both return sources. They are performing well in 2025, with their total returns beating out the overall market. They are also making strong progress in boosting their dividends, with all five recently announcing significant dividend increases of 10% or more. On July 24, Comfort Systems USA NYSE: FIX announced a 10% increase to its quarterly dividend. Its new $0.50 payment will be payable on Aug. 25 to shareholders of record on Aug. 15. Despite this significant increase, the stock has an indicated dividend yield of just under 0.3%. However, the company’s low dividend yield hasn’t come due to a lack of effort to raise it. Since the beginning of 2022, Comfort Systems has raised its dividend more than ten times, and its quarterly payout has nearly quadrupled. However, the firm’s dividend boosts simply haven’t been able to keep up with the stock’s more than 600% rise since the beginning of 2022, pushing its yield down. In 2025 alone, shares are up around 64%. This surge in price reflects strong earnings momentum and investor confidence. While the yield remains low, the company’s consistent dividend growth signals a commitment to returning capital, making it attractive to long-term investors. Next up is Wingstop NASDAQ: WING. The stock has managed to perform well in 2025, providing a total return of nearly 28%. Shares spiked after the company's latest earnings. Wingstop saw its adjusted earnings per share increase in the quarter while analysts expected the figure to fall. Adding to the good news was that Wingstop announced an 11% increase in its quarterly dividend. The stock only has an indicated dividend yield of just over 0.3%, but Wingstop has made strong progress in growing its dividend over the past three years. Its quarterly payout has increased by a compound annual growth rate of more than 16% over that period. Wingstop’s strong performance reflects growing investor confidence and robust earnings momentum. Its consistent dividend increases—even with a modest yield—demonstrate a clear commitment to returning capital and supporting shareholder value. For long-term investors, the combination of growth and income makes Wingstop a noteworthy holding. Healthcare stock McKesson NYSE: MCK also recently announced an increase to its dividend, boosting its quarterly payout by 15%. This raises the company’s dividend to 82 cents, which will be payable on Oct. 1 to stockholders of record on Sept. 2. The stock's indicated dividend yield now sits at just under 0.5%. Still, the firm continues to announce big-time dividend increases year after year. This most recent raise marks the fourth year in a row the company has boosted its dividend by 15%, showing its increasing commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Impressively, McKesson stock has provided a total return of around 23% in 2025. McKesson’s track record of raising its dividend at a steady pace underscores its financial strength and commitment to shareholders. Even with a modest yield, the consistency of these increases adds long-term value. Coupled with its solid performance in 2025, the stock remains a strong healthcare sector performer. On July 24, Encompass Health NYSE: EHC announced a nearly 12% increase to its dividend, boosting its quarterly payment to 19 cents per share. The new dividend is payable on Oct. 15 to holders of record on Oct. 1, and gives the stock an indicated dividend yield of 0.70%. Encompass has also managed to notch a total return of more than 18% in 2025. The company is gradually rebuilding its dividend after a significant cut in 2022, which followed the spin-off of part of its business. The consistent increases since then suggest a renewed focus on long-term capital returns. With operational stability improving, investors could see the dividend climb back toward pre-2022 levels. Last up is healthcare real estate investment trust (REIT) Welltower NYSE: WELL. The company is lifting its quarterly dividend by 10.4% to 74 cents per share. The company will pay this dividend on Aug. 21 to stockholders of record as of Aug. 12. The stock holds the highest indicated dividend yield on our list of just under 1.8%. Still, this yield is the lowest among large-cap U.S. healthcare REITs, whose average yield is approximately 5.1%. However, Welltower has also achieved by far the most impressive total return among that group in 2025 of over 33%. Investors appear to be rewarding the company’s improving fundamentals and consistent dividend growth. With the stock showing strong price performance, further yield compression is possible even as payouts rise. Overall, these five names are taking key steps when it comes to income generation: increasing their dividends. This is particularly important for these names, as they have seen significant share price appreciation recently. Dividend boosts help offset the decline in dividend yields that comes due to rising share prices. This gives these names the opportunity to have dividends as a meaningful part of their overall return profile going forward.

"Syria signs $14 billion in investment deals, including $4 billion airport expansion",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/syria-signs-14-billion-in-investment-deals-including-4-billion-airport-expansion-2025-08-06/,"DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Syria signed agreements worth $14 billion with regional and international companies on Wednesday for 12 investment projects, including modernizing the international airport in Damascus and a new subway system, state media reported. The deals are the largest so far since foreign companies and countries started an investment push into the war-torn country after Western sanctions were eased following the fall of the 54-year rule of the Assad family. The head of Syria’s Investment Authority, Talal al-Halili, was quoted by state-run news agency SANA as saying that the expansion of Damascus’ International Airport will cost $4 billion and will be done by the Qatar-based UCC Holding. SANA said that the airport will be able to serve up to 31 million travelers a year, after the expansion. SANA added that the agreement for the new subway system in the capital is worth $2 billion, and the network is expected to be used by 750,000 people a day. The deal for the subway was signed by Syria’s Transportation Ministry and the United Arab Emirates’ National Investment Corporation, SANA said. Other projects include the $2 billion construction of 60 residential towers with 20,000 housing units outside of the capital. “Syria is open for investments and determined to build a bright future,” al-Hilali said during the ceremony, which was attended by President Ahmad al-Sharaa. In late July, Syria and Saudi Arabia announced 47 investment agreements, valued at more than $6 billion to mark a significant step in rebuilding Syria’s war-battered economy. In May, Syria signed an agreement with a consortium of Qatari, Turkish and U.S. companies for the development of a $7 billion 5,000-megawatt energy project to revitalize much of Syria’s war-battered electricity grid. “The future of a prosperous and peaceful Syria is in the hands of Syria and its regional partners,” said the U.S. special envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, who attended Wednesday’s signing in Damascus.",Get earnings alerts:Sign Up,Get earnings alerts:Sign Up,Get earnings alerts:Sign Up,Get earnings alerts:Sign Up,neutral,0.42418479919433594
