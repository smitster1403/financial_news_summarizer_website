First Tick: Here are the top global cues for today’s trade,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/first-tick-here-are-the-top-global-cues-for-today-s-trade-132-13248083.html,"Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty are likely to see a positive opening on July 10, tracking cues from GIFT Nifty trading around 25,569 a short while ago this morning. Track the latest updates on GIFT Nifty right here on Moneycontrol. Benchmark indices ended on a negative note after a rangebound session on July 9, with last-hour selling taking Nifty below 25,500 as investors stayed cautious ahead of US President Trump's announcement of trade deals with seven more countries on Wednesday. At close, the Sensex was down 176.43 points or 0.21 percent at 83,536.08, and the Nifty was down 46.40 points or 0.18 percent at 25,476.10. Broader indices outperformed the main indices with BSE midcap index was ended flat, while smallcap index added 0.5 percent. Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Up) The GIFT Nifty is trading higher at around 25,569, indicating a positive start for the day. Asian Equities (Mixed) Asian shares opened cautiously as investors held back from taking risky bets after President Donald Trump ruled out extending his August deadline. Copper futures fell on Trump’s tariff threat. US Equities (Gain) Wall Street indexes closed higher on Wednesday, led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq as Nvidia briefly reached a $4 trillion valuation, and Federal Reserve meeting minutes fueled hopes that inflation pressures from President Donald Trump's tariffs would not derail interest rate cuts this year. The minutes for the mid-June meeting showed that most Fed officials said they expect rate cuts will be appropriate later this year, with price shocks from Trump's import taxes expected to be ""temporary or modest."" However, there was little support for a rate cut at the end of July meeting. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 217.54 points, or 0.49%, to 44,458.30, the S&P 500 gained 37.74 points, or 0.61%, to 6,263.26 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 192.87 points, or 0.95%, to 20,611.34. US Bond Yield (Down) The yields on the 10-year Treasury and 2-year Treasury yields were trading marginally lower at 4.33 percent and 3.84 percent respectively. Dollar Index (Down) The U.S. dollar slipped further from a two-week high versus major peers on Thursday, as President Donald Trump's latest tariff salvos failed to shake markets, except in Brazil where a threatened 50% levy sent the real sliding as much as 2.8% overnight. Asian currencies (Gain) Asian currencies were trading mostly higher in the early trade on Thursday with Thai Baht leading the gainers followed by Japanese Yen, Philippines Peso, South Korean Won, Malaysian Ringgit and Singapore Dollar. Crude (Down) Oil prices dropped on Thursday as the latest tariff announcements by U.S. President Donald Trump were perceived by market participants to threaten global economic growth and demand for the resource. Gold (Up) Gold held a small gain, as investors weighed President Donald Trump’s latest trade demands along with the outlook for the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate cycle. Fund Flow Action The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) bought equities worth Rs 77 crore on July 9, while Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) also bought equities worth Rs 920 crore on the same day. Hope you're all set for today's trade. We wish you a profitable day ahead.

SEBI proposes to opening up activities for credit rating agencies,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-proposes-to-opening-up-activities-for-credit-rating-agencies-13251964.html,"After proposing to open up business activities for mutual funds, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has now suggested easing restrictions on credit rating agencies (CRAs). The market regulator has proposed that rating agencies be allowed to undertake activities not regulated by SEBI, subject to certain conditions. For instance, they may be permitted to rate financial instruments that fall under the purview of other financial sector regulators, provided they comply with the regulatory framework specified by the regulator concerned. This includes aspects such as policy, eligibility criteria, risk management, investor grievance mechanisms, dispute resolution, inspection, enforcement and claims. The conditions outlined in SEBI’s proposal include that rating agencies can undertake only fee-based and non-fund-based rating activities. Activities not regulated by SEBI must be carried out strictly at arm’s length through one or more separate business units (SBUs) of the rating agency. These SBUs must be segregated by a Chinese Wall and ring-fenced from SEBI-regulated activities. Rating agencies must transfer all non-SEBI-regulated activities to a separate unit within six months of the date of SEBI’s notification. Separate records must be maintained for the non-SEBI-regulated activities within the SBU. Staff involved in these activities must be distinct from those engaged in SEBI-regulated functions. According to SEBI’s proposal, the information technology infrastructure may be shared between SEBI-regulated and non-SEBI-regulated activities, provided proper procedures approved by the rating agency’s board are followed. Additionally, the minimum net worth of the rating agency must be ring-fenced to prevent any impact arising from non-SEBI-regulated activities. Rating agencies will also be required to disclose on their websites the list of activities that are not regulated by SEBI. Before undertaking such activities, upfront disclosures must be made to all stakeholders, including clients, beneficiaries and counterparties. The same disclosure must be included in all engagement letters, contracts, agreements and business communications. A confirmation must also be obtained from stakeholders at the time of engagement, stating that they understand the nature of the activity, the associated risks and the absence of SEBI’s investor protection mechanisms. For existing and ongoing arrangements involving such activities, rating agencies must make the necessary disclosures, obtain the required confirmations or acknowledgements from stakeholders and submit a compliance report to SEBI within six months of the proposal’s notification. Financial sector regulators include the Reserve Bank of India, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority, International Financial Services Centres Authority, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India or any other authority specified by SEBI. SEBI has invited feedback on the consultation paper by July 30.",Staff involved in these activities must be distinct from those engaged in SEBI-regulated functions.,"Financial sector regulators include the Reserve Bank of India, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority, International Financial Services Centres Authority, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India or any other authority specified by SEBI.","After proposing to open up business activities for mutual funds, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has now suggested easing restrictions on credit rating agencies (CRAs).","A confirmation must also be obtained from stakeholders at the time of engagement, stating that they understand the nature of the activity, the associated risks and the absence of SEBI’s investor protection mechanisms.",neutral,0.9405359029769897

Outlook for July 10 Aditya Gaggar Director of Progressive Shares A rangebound activity was witnessed for most part of the session, but a sudden fall in the last session dragged the Index lower to close the trade at 25,476.10 with a loss of 46.40 points. FMCG was the top gainer, followed by Auto, whereas Realty and Metal declined by over 1.40% each. A mixed trend was seen among the Broader markets, where Midcaps more or less moved in tandem with Nifty50, while Smallcaps outperformed. Despite the Flag and Pole formation breakout, the Index failed to capitalise on the positive momentum and formed a bearish candle. In terms of levels, 25,580 and 25,430 will continue to act as immediate resistance and support, respectively. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets traded in a volatile but in a narrow range and ended marginally lower, extending the ongoing consolidation phase. After an initial dip, the Nifty attempted to recover in the first half; however, a sharp decline in select heavyweights during the final hours derailed the recovery and dragged the index lower. Eventually, the Nifty settled at 25,476.10, down by 0.18%. On the sectoral front, the mixed trend persisted—FMCG and auto sectors edged higher, while realty, metal, and IT were among the top losers. The broader market also reflected a mixed performance, with the small-cap index gaining over half a percent, while the mid-cap index ended almost flat. While the tariff-related concerns linger, the focus now shifts to the earnings season, with IT major, TCS, scheduled to announce its results on Thursday, July 10. Additionally, the weekly expiry could add to the choppiness. Amid all this, we maintain our bullish stance and recommend continuing with a “buy on dips” strategy, with a strong emphasis on stock selection. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty witnessed range-bound movement after a strong upmove, facing stiff resistance around 25,500–25,550. On the hourly chart, the index has slipped below the 50-hour simple moving average, while the RSI has also moved below the 50 mark, indicating weakening momentum. However, it continues to hold above the breakout zone of 25,200–25,250, which may act as immediate support in the short term. As long as this level is sustained, the broader trend remains positive. A sustained move above 25,550 could trigger fresh upside.

While the index was hovering in the red since morning, the selling pressure intensified after short seller Viceroy Research issued a report on its parent firm Vedanta Resources (VRL), claiming that the Anil Agarwal-led conglomerate ""resembles a Ponzi scheme"". Viceroy Research shorts Vedanta Resources debt, calls it a 'parasite' The US-headquartered short seller took a short position of VRL’s debt, calling it a ""parasite holding company with no significant operations of its own, propped up entirely by cash extracted from its dying host, Vedanta Limited"".Vedanta – Limited Resources Viceroy is short of Vedanta Resources (PropCo), the heavily indebted parent & majority owner of Vedanta Limited (NSE : VEDL). The group structure is financially unsustainable, operationally compromised, & resembles a Ponzi scheme. $VEDL 1/ pic.twitter.com/U15v9tlnPm — Viceroy (@viceroyresearch) July 9, 2025 Anil Agarwal-owned mining conglomerate is systematically draining Vedanta to service its own debt, Viceroy further said. ""VRL's actions to meet its short-term obligations directly impair its creditors’ long-term ability to recover their principal, a situation that resembles a Ponzi scheme where Vedanta stakeholders, which include VRL creditors, are the ""suckers',"" it added. Vedanta shares crashed over 8 percent after the report was published. The stock has now made some recovery, trading over 3 percent lower at Rs 440 apiece. Further, the American short seller said that Hindustan Zinc's resources are being ""looted"" through related-party deals with promoter-family owned companies and unjustifiable brand fees. ""Vedanta's crown jewel may be its biggest liability,"" it said while speaking about Hindustan Zinc. The shares of the company are currently down nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 424 apiece. A perusal of HZL’s brand fee arrangement (2% of revenues) shows that brand fees are often paid in advance on revenue “estimates”, which appear to be consistently over-estimated. This acts as a interest-free line of credit for tens of millions of dollars. $VEDL 15/ pic.twitter.com/IU8ETl0jR8 — Viceroy (@viceroyresearch) July 9, 2025 Trump threatens 50% tariff on US imports Hindustan Copper, which is part of the group, also witnessed significant selling pressure. The shares of the company dropped over 3 percent. This was further buoyed following US President Trump's threat to impose a 50 percent tariff on imported copper soon, leading to a surge in US prices of the metal by more than 12 percent. Hindalco Industries shares were meanwhile down nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 674 apiece. ""I believe the tariff on copper, we're going to make 50%,"" the US President told reporters at a White House cabinet meeting. Following this, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview with CNBC that the copper tariffs will likely be put in place by the end of July or August 1. Steel, aluminium not to be part of India-US mini trade deal, says reports Steel and aluminium stocks meanwhile plummeted amid reports stating that the two metals won’t be part of the mini trade deal which will likely be announced by US and India soon. Without any exemptions, the steel and aluminium companies will face a 50 percent tariff on exports to America. Tata Steel shares plunged over 2 percent to trade at Rs 158 apiece, while those of Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and National Aluminium Company (NALCO) dropped over 1.5 percent each. NMDC, JSW Steel and Adani Enterprises shares were trading in the red with marginal losses.","Tata Steel shares plunged over 2 percent to trade at Rs 158 apiece, while those of Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and National Aluminium Company (NALCO) dropped over 1.5 percent each.","Viceroy Research shorts Vedanta Resources debt, calls it a 'parasite' The US-headquartered short seller took a short position of VRL’s debt, calling it a ""parasite holding company with no significant operations of its own, propped up entirely by cash extracted from its dying host, Vedanta Limited"".Vedanta – Limited Resources Viceroy is short of Vedanta Resources (PropCo), the heavily indebted parent & majority owner of Vedanta Limited (NSE : VEDL).","Further, the American short seller said that Hindustan Zinc's resources are being ""looted"" through related-party deals with promoter-family owned companies and unjustifiable brand fees.","Viceroy Research shorts Vedanta Resources debt, calls it a 'parasite' The US-headquartered short seller took a short position of VRL’s debt, calling it a ""parasite holding company with no significant operations of its own, propped up entirely by cash extracted from its dying host, Vedanta Limited"".Vedanta – Limited Resources Viceroy is short of Vedanta Resources (PropCo), the heavily indebted parent & majority owner of Vedanta Limited (NSE : VEDL).",negative,0.560089111328125

Titan shares jump over 6% as revenue rises 25% YoY in Q4 business update,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/titan-shares-in-focus-as-revenue-rises-25-yoy-in-q4-business-update-12988015.html,"Shares of Titan surged 6.5 percent to Rs 3,222 per share on April 8, following the company’s upbeat business update for the March quarter. In its fourth-quarter business update, Titan reported a 25 percent year-on-year increase in revenue across all its verticals. The company’s flagship jewellery segment witnessed a 25 percent growth compared to the same quarter last year. This was largely fueled by a significant uptick in gold prices. However, the rise in gold rates also had a dampening effect on demand in lower price brackets, resulting in only single-digit growth in the number of buyers. Stay tuned to our LIVE blog for all the real-time market developments Titan's eyecare segment recorded a 19 percent rise, supported by healthy contributions in both revenue and customer base. Meanwhile, the watches and wearables division reported a 22 percent increase in revenue. Other businesses under the Titan umbrella—which include fragrances and fashion accessories—grew by 26 percent year-on-year. This was primarily driven by a 12 percent increase in the fashion accessories category. On the flip side, sales of its ethnic wear brand Taneira dipped by 4 percent. During the quarter, the company launched the first experiential store for its fragrance brand 'SKINN' at Seawoods, Mumbai. Its premium handbag brand 'IRTH' expanded with four new store openings in Hyderabad, Pune, Noida, and Mumbai. Taneira, however, shut down one store in the same period. Titan’s digital-first jewellery brand Caratlane posted a 22 percent year-on-year growth, boosted by strong consumer interest in gold jewellery and a robust performance in its studded collection. The number of buyers grew in the mid-single digits, while like-to-like growth stood at 11 percent. During the quarter, Caratlane added 17 new domestic stores on a net basis. At present, around 35 brokerages are tracking Titan. Of these, 21 have issued a “buy” rating, 10 have recommended a “hold,” and 4 have suggested a “sell.” So far this year, shares of Titan have slipped by 7 percent. This decline is slightly steeper than the 6 percent fall registered by the benchmark Nifty 50 index over the same period.

The European Union proposed counter-tariffs on Monday, while Trump threatened to add another 50% duty on U.S. imports from China on Wednesday if it did not withdraw its 34% retaliatory tariffs from last week.

Fund Flow Action The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) continued their selling on the sixth day on March 7, with selling equities worth Rs 9040 crore, however, Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) turned into net buyers as they bought equities of Rs 12122 crore on the same day.

Wall Street equities have been hammered since Trump's sweeping tariffs, announced late Wednesday, on all imports into the U.S. and much higher levies on some major trading partners. Trading volume on Monday broke U.S. records for the second session in a row. In early trade, all three major U.S. indexes touched their lowest levels in more than a year.

In the first two days following Trump's tariff announcements last week, the benchmark S&P 500 index had dived 10.5% and lost about $5 trillion in market value for its biggest two-day loss since March 2020. On Friday, the blue-chip Dow confirmed it was in a correction, or more than 10% below its December record close while the Nasdaq confirmed it was in a bear market, defined as a decline of 20% or more below its record close. In Monday morning trading, the S&P 500 had fallen 20% below its record closing high. The index briefly rallied more than 3%, after a news report said Trump was considering a 90-day pause on tariffs. White House officials quickly denied the report, sending the market back into the red. Meckler said the market's wild swings on Monday left investors ""a little bit concerned that if facts start to change, you could see a very rapid rise to this market."" ""It's leading to this back-and-forth movement of rallies that are effectively being sold and drops in the market where people are covering shorts or trying to find a place to buy.""

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finance, GMR Airports, Chambal Fertilizers, PNB Housing, and others on April 8?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-kotak-mahindra-bank-bajaj-finance-gmr-airports-chambal-fertilizers-pnb-housing-and-others-on-april-8-12987972.html,"The benchmark indices nosedived sharply and closed with a 3 percent decline after recouping around 2 percent from the day's low, tracking tariff-led turmoil in global peers. The market breadth was dismal, with a total of 2,448 shares trapped in a bear market, compared to just 193 shares that outperformed. The trend is expected to remain favourable for bears, but some rebound can't be ruled out, considering the significant fall in the past few days. Below are some trading ideas for the near term: Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Kotak Mahindra Bank | CMP: Rs 2,037.85 Kotak Mahindra Bank has been one of the outperformers in the Nifty private sector banks, and the uptrend has been largely due to short covering. The stock has provided a breakout from a range lasting more than 3 years, which is quite significant. It is one of the few stocks in the current scenario trading near its all-time high levels, reflecting relative outperformance. Due to the heavy sell-off in the markets during the last trading session, the stock witnessed Put unwinding at almost all the strikes. However, it didn’t see much short addition from current levels; rather, the stock bounced back from lower levels. Based on these observations, the probability of the stock holding onto the Rs 2,000 levels—its second-highest Put open interest—is quite high, at least on a closing basis. Below that, there is another critical support level at Rs 1,960. Therefore, the risk-reward is favourable on the long side. So, buy Kotak Mahindra Bank in the range of Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,040. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,120, Rs 2,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,960 Bajaj Finance | CMP: Rs 8,568 Bajaj Finance has also witnessed a huge range breakout—a consolidation breakout lasting more than 3 years—and the short covering is still pending. Since the prices have fallen back to the level from where it broke upwards, there is a higher probability of short covering, as the stock has not seen a significant short build-up in the recent fall from the top. While there was Put unwinding at most strikes, additions were seen at the Rs 8,400 strike. Hence, the range of Rs 8,500 to Rs 8,400 is very critical in the near term, while Rs 9,000 is an immediate hurdle, making it the first target due to the highest Call open interest. So, buy Bajaj Finance in the range of Rs 8,550 to Rs 8,650. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 9,000, Rs 9,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 8,220 SRF | CMP: Rs 2,715.2 SRF has also outperformed the overall markets recently. There has been a breakout from a huge consolidation due to sharp short covering. Although some fresh short additions were seen in the recent fall, the prices have reversed from the breakout point, making the risk-reward favourable on the long side. The Rs 2,700 strike Put has the highest open interest, while the Rs 3,000 strike Call has the highest open interest. So, the range to watch is Rs 2,700 to Rs 3,000, and since the stock is near the lower end of the range, the bulls have a favourable chance from hereon. Buy SRF in the range of Rs 2,700 to Rs 2,650. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,900, Rs 3,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,550 Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Zomato | CMP: Rs 209.63 Despite a sharp market-wide correction, Zomato outperformed, closing with only a marginal loss. The stock is forming multiple bottoms near the Rs 195 level, indicating strong support. Traders may consider entering long positions near Rs 205, with a stop-loss at Rs 195 and an upside target of Rs 225. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 225 Stop-Loss: Rs 195 GMR Airports | CMP: Rs 82.22 Unlike most F&O stocks, GMR Airports ended with gains in an otherwise volatile market. The stock witnessed a breakout above Rs 80, followed by a sharp pullback, and has now resumed its upward move. This price action suggests renewed strength and presents a potential buying opportunity. Traders may consider entering long positions near Rs 80, with a stop-loss at Rs 76 and an upside target of Rs 88. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 88 Stop-Loss: Rs 76 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments Chambal Fertilizers and Chemicals | CMP: Rs 612.8 Chambal Fertilizers, after breaking out of a rectangle pattern at Rs 546, offered no buying dips—until today. The stock has now smartly defended its 10–20 day moving average zone, giving short-term traders a golden entry into the momentum. Today’s bullish candle hints at renewed buying interest, supported by the cooling off of previously overheated momentum indicators. With the trend intact and structure strong, Chambal Fertilizers looks poised to clock fresh all-time highs in the coming sessions. Traders should watch for continued strength above support to ride the next leg up. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 700 Stop-Loss: Rs 580 PNB Housing Finance | CMP: Rs 923.65 PNB Housing Finance has defended its rounding bottom breakout impressively, even amid a falling market, with volumes consistently above the 50-day average, signaling strong institutional accumulation. For the bullish momentum to persist, the stock must hold above Rs 940. A sustained move above this level will likely lead to an initial target of Rs 1,050. The volume profile throughout the entire pattern reflects accumulation by strong hands, suggesting confidence in the stock’s long-term potential and positioning it as a frontrunner once market sentiment improves. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,050 Stop-Loss: Rs 880 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Wall Street trades lower as Trump threatens China with steeper tariffs, markets near bear territory",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/wall-street-trades-lower-as-trump-threatens-china-with-steeper-tariffs-markets-near-bear-territory-12987885.html,"Wall Street's main indices continued to trade firmly lower albeit off lows as investors grappled with growing fears of a prolonged trade war and a White House unwilling to blink. Fears deepened as President Trump doubled down on his hardline trade stance, threatening even steeper tariffs on China — a move that escalated an already fraught standoff and pushed US markets closer to bear territory. Also read: India well poised to take advantage of current situation: Piyush Goyal on market upheaval from Trump's tariffs The S&P 500 shed 0.8 percent, now down nearly 20 percent from its February peak — the threshold that typically signals a bear market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 988 points, or 2.6 percent, following two historic 1,500-point declines last week. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 percent and is now 24 percent below its record high, with tech stocks once again leading losses. Markets saw a brief bounce at the open on hopes that the White House might consider delaying the sweeping tariff hikes that went into effect over the weekend. But that optimism was short-lived. The administration dismissed talk of a 90-day pause as “fake news,” triggering a sharp reversal. Over the weekend, Trump defended the policy, comparing it to ""medicine"" needed to fix systemic trade imbalances. On Monday, he issued a fresh warning to China on social media, threatening to slap a 50 percent tariff unless Beijing rolled back its retaliatory measures by April 8. Talks, he added, would be suspended if China failed to comply. Read more: Warburg expected to lead troubled MFI Fusion Finance’s rights issue Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the hardline approach, telling CBS News: “The tariffs are coming... They are going to stay in place for days and weeks.” The sheer scale and speed of the tariff rollout has stunned investors. Rates have been applied across dozens of trade partners without the usual economic justifications. China, instead of seeking negotiations, retaliated immediately with a 34 percent levy on all US imports. With the administration showing little appetite for compromise, Wall Street is now pricing in a long, messy trade war. The market rout is also raising fears of forced selling, as funds scramble to raise cash to meet margin calls. The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, spiked to 50 on Monday — a level typically associated with extreme market stress. The sell-off spilled into other asset classes. Bitcoin dropped below $77,000, oil prices fell under $60 a barrel, and volatility surged. European markets slumped for a fourth straight session on Monday, caught in the global equity rout sparked by President Trump’s aggressive new tariff regime. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index dropped as much as 6 percent before trimming losses to end 4.54 percent lower. France’s CAC 40 tumbled 4.8 percent, Germany’s DAX shed 4.26 percent, and the UK’s FTSE 100 declined 4.4 percent, as fears of an escalating trade war and a prolonged downturn continued to rattle investor nerves.

"Futile to predict future, stick to asset allocation dharma, says Kotak's Nilesh Shah amid market turmoil",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/futile-to-predict-future-stick-to-asset-allocation-dharma-says-kotaks-nilesh-shah-amid-market-turmoil-12987853.html,"The market, caught in the crossfire of an unpredictable tariff war, is struggling to find its footing. Every fresh development triggers a reaction, and the uncertainty has left sellers in an aggressive mood while buyers are hesitant to commit. ""It’s futile to predict how events will unfold,"" said Nilesh Shah, Managing Director of Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company. ""What investors can do is stick to their asset allocation dharma."" According to Shah, large-cap stocks are fairly valued and deserve a neutral allocation. But any correction should be seen as an opportunity. ""Buy gradually as markets turn cheaper. That’s how you position to be overweight equities,"" he advised. Amid the global noise, Shah believes domestic stories hold promise—especially sectors like cement, building materials, and consumer discretionary, which offer strong long-term potential. He pointed to several tailwinds supporting consumption: tax rebates announced in the budget, reduced EMI burdens thanks to falling interest rates, a likely dip in oil prices, and the expected rollout of the eighth pay commission next year. Indian equities witnessed a massive bloodbath in today's session. Dalal Street went into a freefall on April 7, as panic-selling took the benchmark indices sharply lower. Triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff tantrum on Wall Street, a wave of global jitters wiped out a jaw-dropping Rs 16 lakh crore in market value — the sharpest intraday collapse since June 2024. Inflation fears, a looming consumption crunch, and recession fears had investors running for cover as the Nifty and Sensex plunged deep into the red. India VIX — the fear gauge of the domestic market — soared as much as 66 percent to 22.85 on April 7, marking its sharpest intraday spike since June 4, 2024, according to Bloomberg data.

During the trading session of April 7, FIIs bought shares worth Rs 13,372 crore and sold shares worth Rs 22,412 crore. DIIs purchased shares worth Rs 26,528 crore and sold shares worth Rs 14,405 crore.

""The primary reason behind the selloff is the fear of a full-blown global trade war and its potential to tip the world economy into a recession. Countries including China, Canada, and the European Union have spoken about retaliatory tariffs on American goods, and the uncertainty around whether a settlement can be reached before the next phase of tariff hikes is causing widespread nervousness,"" Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Research and Wealth Management said in a conversation with Moneycontrol. Khemka advised against panic selling or making adventurous bets. Instead, he recommended a disciplined, long-term approach. Investors should use the correction to gradually accumulate fundamentally strong, domestically focused companies, particularly in consumption, financials, and banks. These areas are better positioned to weather global headwinds compared to globally exposed sectors like IT, pharma, and metals.

Coming off a brutal week, Monday’s losses added to the wreckage across equity markets. The Dow has now shed more than 1,200 points to trade 3 percent lower for three straight sessions— a historic first — including a staggering 2,231-point tumble on Friday. The S&P 500 lost 6 percent on the last day of the previous week, its sharpest single-day decline since the COVID crash in March 2020, wiping out 10 percent in just two sessions. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has officially entered bear market territory, now down over 22 percent from its all-time high. Investors had hoped the weekend would bring some signs of moderation or talks following President Trump’s abrupt imposition of 10 percent tariffs on nearly all key U.S. trade partners, which kicked in on Saturday. Instead, the White House struck a combative tone. ""I don’t want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,"" Trump said in a Sunday evening statement. ""We’re losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China. Until we fix that, there won’t be a deal."" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reaffirmed the administration’s firm stance, stating that the tariffs were ""definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks,"" quashing any hopes of a near-term reversal. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed the message, adding that while over 50 countries have approached the U.S. for talks, resolving the issue won’t be quick. Canada and the European Union are reportedly preparing countermeasures as well, signalling a broadening of the standoff. Wall Street now fears the selloff could spiral further, as hedge funds and institutional investors are forced to liquidate positions to meet mounting margin calls. The CBOE Volatility Index — Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge — shot up to 50 early Monday, a level rarely seen outside of major bear markets. The ripple effects were felt far beyond U.S. shores. Bitcoin crashed below $77,000, oil prices tumbled under $60 per barrel to multi-year lows, and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong nosedived 13 percent in its steepest drop since 1997. Germany’s DAX also sank, falling as much as 10 percent during Monday’s session. Among the hardest-hit U.S. stocks were high-profile names like Tesla, down 6 percent in early trade, along with Caterpillar — a global construction bellwether — which shed 5 percent. Apple also saw a sharp 4 percent drop. If the S&P 500 closes down 4 percent or more on Monday, it would mark the third consecutive day of such a steep decline — something that hasn’t happened since the depths of the Great Depression in 1933. With the administration showing no signs of backing down and retaliatory measures mounting, traders are bracing for more pain in the days ahead — unless diplomacy steps in to cool things off. As for Indian markets, Dalal Street went into a freefall on April 7, as panic-selling took the benchmark indices sharply lower. Triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff tantrum on Wall Street, a wave of global jitters wiped out a jaw-dropping Rs 16 lakh crore in market value — the sharpest intraday collapse since June 2024.

Britannia (up by 0.65% at closing) BritanniaShares of the FMCG major gained during the market mayhem, with Nifty FMCG index emerging as the least-impacted index, with 3 out of 15 constituents in the positive. The relative outperformance of FMCG is attributed to their consumer-facing nature, which provides cushion during market volatility. Trent (down by 14.77% at closing) TrentShares of Trent fell sharply by about 18% after the promoter of Zudio and Westside apparel chains announced a weak Q4FY25 business update, showing Q4FY25 revenue was lower than estimate.

Bharat Petroleum (down by 1% at closing) Bharat PetroleumShares of BPCL ended in the red with losses, however, the stock rebounded by nearly 5 percent from its day’s lows. The fall in Brent crude is expected to benefit oil marketing companies as the decline in crude prices would lower their input costs. Delhivery (down by 3.69% at closing) DelhiveryOwing to acquisition of Ecom Express, Delhivery shares defy general market sentiment and leap 4%. Estimates predict further upward movement.

Mazagaon (down by 8.39%) Mazagon Dock ShipbuildersThe shares of Mazagon crashed nearly 10 percent, marking a downgrade for a third continuous session, fuelled by government's plans to sell up to 4.83 percent stake in the PSU defence firm.

The shares of the company were trading at Rs 2,272 apiece in the morning. Nomura initiated a 'Reduce' rating on the shares of the real estate major, with a target price of Rs 1,900 apiece. This implies a downside potential of nearly 18 percent from the stock's previous closing price of Rs 2,310 apiece. The global brokerage said that the company's pre-sales momentum was likely to be weaker than expectations. The stock's valuation looks stretched, it added. The brokerage expects the company to report pre-sales volume for FY26 at Rs 31,000 crore, lower than its guidance of Rs 32,500 crore. Volume-driven strategy poses risk of further equity dilution and execution challenges, which are visible, Nomura further said in its note. Godrej Properties shares have tumbled nearly 8 percent in the past one month, and around 9 percent in the past six months. The stock is down over 18 percent so far in 2025. While the stock declined over 30 percent in the past one year, it gained nearly 155 percent in the past five years. The stock currently has a P/E ratio of over 47.

Earlier in May, the real estate company had reported a 19 percent year-on-year fall in net profit to Rs 382 crore for the fourth quarter of the financial year 2024-2025. It had earlier reported a net profit of Rs 471 crore in Q4 FY24. Although the company reported a fall in net profit on an yearly basis, it rose by a whopping 135 percent from the Rs 163 crore net profit reported in the previous quarter (Q3 FY25). The real estate major's revenue from operations strongly surged on both terms, rising 49 percent from Q4 FY24 and 119 percent from Q3 FY25 to Rs 2,122 crore during the quarter under review. Godrej Properties also reported an EBITDA of Rs 634 crore for Q4 FY25, marking a 2 percent fall from the Rs 649 crore EBITDA reported in Q4 FY24.

Prices of US Comex copper futures jumped over 12 percent to hit a record high after Trump’s announcement, as the 50 percent rate mentioned by Trump was higher than analysts’ expectations. Shares of Vedanta, Hindustan Copper and Hindalco Industries shares fell in early trade, with shares of Hind Copper down by over 1.8 percent at 9:48 am. Also Read: Our LIVE blog on stock market updates ""I believe the tariff on copper, we're going to make 50%,"" the US President told reporters at a White House cabinet meeting. Following this, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview with CNBC that the copper tariffs will likely be put in place by the end of July or August 1, and President Trump would post details regarding the same on his Truth Social media account on Tuesday. ""The idea is to bring copper home, bring copper production home, bring the ability to make copper, which is key to the industrial sector, back home to America,"" Lutnick said. He added that the administration's Section 232 investigation into US imports of the red metal was completed, much ahead of the November deadline for the review. Trump’s copper tariff dare comes as the demand for the metal is expected to rise going ahead, with increasing demand seen from data centers, car companies and power producers. Already, there are duties in place on import of steel, aluminum and automobiles into America.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Chennai Petroleum, NHPC, Valor Estate, KPR Mill, Motherson Sumi Wiring, Tech Mahindra and others on July 9?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-chennai-petroleum-nhpc-valor-estate-kpr-mill-motherson-sumi-wiring-tech-mahindra-and-others-on-july-9-13244917.html,"Equity benchmarks gained strength in late trade after consolidation and closed 0.24 percent higher on the Nifty 50 on July 8, but the market breadth was negative. A total of 1,452 shares declined, compared to 1,192 shares that advanced on the NSE. The consolidation and rangebound trading may continue until the frontline indices decisively surpass the recent swing high. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP- Technical Research at Kotak Securities Tech Mahindra | CMP: Rs 1,635.4 After the remarkable up move, Tech Mahindra is taking a breather and has been in consolidation over the last few sessions. The rangebound structure suggests a bullish continuation chart formation. Moreover, the stock has comfortably closed above its breakout levels. Therefore, the stock is likely to resume its uptrend from current levels in the near term. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,575 could be the trend-deciding level for the bulls. If it sustains above this level, we can expect a further uptrend toward Rs 1,750. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,750 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,575 PFC | CMP: Rs 419.8 After declining from higher levels, Power Finance Corporation rebounded from its retracement zone and witnessed a sharp recovery from the lower levels. Additionally, on the intraday scale, the counter has given a breakout from its sloping channel formation. The reversal move in the counter suggests a new leg of the bullish trend from current levels. As long as the stock trades above Rs 405, the bullish texture is likely to continue. Above this, the counter could move up to Rs 450 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 450 Stop-Loss: Rs 405 Federal Bank | CMP: Rs 213.5 On the weekly scale, Federal Bank is in a rising channel chart formation, with a higher high and higher low series pattern. The counter witnessed a steady recovery from the lower levels. Additionally, the technical indicator ADX is also indicating a further uptrend from current levels, which could boost bullish momentum in the near future. For positional traders, Rs 206 would be the decisive level. Trading above this level, the uptrend formation will likely continue till Rs 229. However, if it closes below Rs 206, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 229 Stop-Loss: Rs 206 Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities Chennai Petroleum Corporation | CMP: Rs 734 Chennai Petroleum Corporation is in a healthy intermediate uptrend after touching a low of Rs 433 in early March 2025. Last week, the stock broke out of a range on the back of huge volumes, after recently bouncing from the 20-week SMA. The stock also trades above the 50-week SMA, and momentum readings like the 14-week RSI are in rising mode and not overbought, which augurs well for the uptrend to continue. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 900 Stop-Loss: Rs 660 Honeywell Automation | CMP: Rs 40,870 Honeywell Automation has rallied smartly in recent weeks after forming a double bottom around Rs 37,000. This week, the stock took out its recent highs on the back of above-average volumes. It also closed above key moving averages, and momentum readings like the 14-day RSI are rising and not overbought, supporting the bullish trend. Patterns also look strong on larger weekly and monthly timeframes. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 44,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 38,400 NHPC | CMP: Rs 88 NHPC has reversed its recent downtrend after forming a double bottom around Rs 80. This week, the stock broke out of a narrow range on the back of healthy volumes, and also closed above the 20- and 50-day SMAs. Momentum indicators like the 14-day RSI are rising and not overbought, which bodes well for the continuation of the uptrend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 95 Stop-Loss: Rs 84 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Valor Estate | CMP: Rs 246.65 In the previous session, Valor Estate rallied 4.8 percent, closing above its previous swing high of Rs 245, which is a strong bullish sign. The stock has been consistently outperforming its peers. Additionally, prices have retraced nearly 78.6% of the fall that began in February 2024, and with follow-up buying, it could fully retrace its prior fall, deriving a long-term target of Rs 286 on the upside. As the current rise was steep, all indicators are in overbought territory, suggesting that buying on dips may be a prudent strategy to ride the trend. The current trend for Valor Estate is bullish. Use dips as a buying opportunity for potential upside towards Rs 255, followed by Rs 270. On the downside, Rs 233 is the nearest support level to watch. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 255, Rs 270 Stop-Loss: Rs 233 KPR Mill | CMP: Rs 1,209.6 On the daily chart, KPR Mill has consistently managed to hold above its previous day’s low on a closing basis since July 2, suggesting bullish control. Recently, prices dipped toward an upward-sloping trendline, which acted as classic support, after which the stock rallied more than 13%, reinforcing a positive outlook. Furthermore, the stock has just broken out above the Ichimoku cloud indicator, and with follow-up buying, a fresh rally can be expected. The MACD has also recently witnessed a bullish crossover, providing double confirmation. The current trend for KPR Mill favors the bulls. A break above Rs 1,230 is crucial for a trending move toward Rs 1,280, followed by Rs 1,330. On the downside, Rs 1,180 is the nearest support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,280, Rs 1,330 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,180 Motherson Sumi Wiring | CMP: Rs 64.6 In the previous session, Motherson Sumi Wiring surged more than 4%, with a significant rise in volumes—the highest in the past six months. On the daily chart, the stock had been forming a small rounding bottom pattern since June 2025, and in the previous session, it broke out of the pattern, closing above the neckline at Rs 62.84. The daily chart also shows a higher high–higher low structure since April 2025. For the past six trading sessions, prices have protected the previous candle’s low on a closing basis, indicating a strong bullish bias. The current trend for the stock favours bulls. Use dips towards Rs 63 as a buying opportunity for targets of Rs 66, followed by Rs 68.

This transformation has been bolstered by significant debt reduction and advancements in its drug development pipeline, particularly with its novel antibiotics targeting superbugs. Key drivers include the approval and launch of Miqnaf in India and the impending US filing for Zaynich, both with QIDP status from the USFDA. The company's focus on regulatory readiness and plans to double production capacity have also instilled investor confidence, positioning Wockhardt to capitalize on emerging market opportunities and drive future growth. Suven Life Sciences:With a return of 130.18%, Suven Life Sciences' strong stock performance, despite its unprofitability and reliance on promoter funding, is a classic high-risk, high-reward scenario. Investors are betting on the immense potential of its Central Nervous System (CNS) drug pipeline, where a single successful ""blockbuster"" drug could lead to massive returns. This speculative optimism, primarily from retail investors, has created a powerful momentum effect, driving the price up.

Criminal prosecution against Jane Street? Sebi Act empowers watchdog to seek fine and imprisonment of up to 10 years,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/criminal-prosecution-against-jane-street-sebi-act-empowers-watchdog-to-seek-fine-and-imprisonment-13243161.html,"Capital market regulator Sebi’s July 3 interim order barring proprietary trading firm Jane Street for unlawful gains has prompted few traders who had lost money to suspect that their trading strategy failed due to alleged manipulation by Jane Street-controlled entities. Some of these participants are now seeking more stringent action against the firm, including criminal prosecution against entities involved. Legal experts believe that watchdog indeed has such powers under the Sebi Act, though it has not been used much, and applied judiciously in only select cases impacting market integrity. “Pursuant to Section 24 of the Sebi Act, 1992, Sebi has the statutory authority to initiate criminal prosecution against any person or entity found guilty of contravening the provisions of the Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder. In the case of Jane Street, if market manipulation is established and falls within the purview of fraudulent or unfair trade practices, Sebi is well within its jurisdiction to commence prosecution proceedings,” Sonam Chandwani, Managing Partner KS Legal & Associates said. Section 24 (1) prescribes imprisonment of up to 10 years or a fine of upto Rs 25 crore, or both. Chandwani added, “In a scenario where Jane Street is found to have willfully engaged in manipulative practices affecting the Indian securities market, Sebi not only has the mandate but also the legal standing to initiate and pursue criminal prosecution under the existing legislative framework.” Another legal expert said that market manipulation is a serious breach of integrity, and such conduct typically falls under the ambit of the Sebi (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (PFUTP Regulations). These regulations, when read with Section 24, provide a cohesive framework empowering Sebi not only to impose monetary penalties and pass remedial directions but also to pursue criminal prosecution before a competent court. Mayank Bansal, the hedge fund manager who noticed and alerted about the alleged manipulative trades by Jane Street said, “Such large-scale systemic manipulation of India's premier indices for a period as large as two years commands nothing short of invoking of the highest possible powers at Sebi's disposal. There is no bigger financial fraud that a person can do against a nation.” Mayank further adds, “Market manipulation is treated as a very serious offense by the SEC and the DoJ (Department of Justice) in the US too, with multiple prominent traders having faced jail term for precisely this felony.” But Sebi uses this power not very frequently. Ravi Prakash, Associate Partner, Corporate Professionals, says, “Sebi will not typically pursue criminal prosecution unless the gravity of the offence, repetition of violations, the impact on investors, and the intention behind the offence point to a high level of misconduct. In cases where violations are deliberate and repetitive, and the interests of investors are significantly harmed, Sebi may deem the case serious enough to justify criminal prosecution”. Ravi further explains, “The reasons for Sebi’s relative infrequency in invoking criminal prosecution is because Sebi generally adopts a policy of using their in-house measures (banning, penalties, disgorgement etc, as provided under Securities laws) as the primary enforcement tools. This allows Sebi to address a wide range of violations effectively, swiftly and without the complexities and delays associated with criminal law procedure”. Also Read: Sebi likely to probe if Jane Street violated index position limits in F&O segment Jane Street has disputed the allegations in Sebi’s interim order, and has communicated to its staff that it will challenge the ban by Sebi. The trades under question were ‘basic index arbitrage trading’, Jane Street told its employees, adding that it was ‘beyond disappointed’ by what it called ‘extremely inflammatory’ accusations by Sebi, and is working on a formal response. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) in letter dated February 6, 2025 addressed to Jane Street had pointed at violation of Sebi rules. “The above trading activity prima facie appears to be fraudulent and manipulative in terms of dealing in top constituents of index in cash market / futures segment and taking relatively large size contra position in options expiring on that day on the same index,” NSE’s letter said. Sebi interim order has highlighted the violation flagged off by NSE in its order. “Prima facie, the aforesaid trading patterns employed by the JS Group fall foul of regulation 4(2)(a) and 4(2)(e) of the PFUTP Regulations and the schemes as a whole are prima facie a fraudulent device prohibited by section 12A of the SEBI Act and regulations 3(a)-(d) and 4(1) of the PFUTP Regulations.” Regulation 4(2)(a) of PFUTP deems any act to be manipulative or fraudulent if it creates false or misleading appearance of trading in the securities market. Regulation 4(2)(e) deems any act to be fraudulent or manipulative if it amounts to manipulation of price of a security, or manipulates the benchmark price of any securities.

As per Sebi, Jane Street made a profit of Rs 36,671 crore between January 2023 and March 2025. The regulator in its interim order has directed to impound Rs 4843.5 crore that it believes were gains made through unfair trades.","Chandwani added, “In a scenario where Jane Street is found to have willfully engaged in manipulative practices affecting the Indian securities market, Sebi not only has the mandate but also the legal standing to initiate and pursue criminal prosecution under the existing legislative framework.” Another legal expert said that market manipulation is a serious breach of integrity, and such conduct typically falls under the ambit of the Sebi (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (PFUTP Regulations).","Chandwani added, “In a scenario where Jane Street is found to have willfully engaged in manipulative practices affecting the Indian securities market, Sebi not only has the mandate but also the legal standing to initiate and pursue criminal prosecution under the existing legislative framework.” Another legal expert said that market manipulation is a serious breach of integrity, and such conduct typically falls under the ambit of the Sebi (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (PFUTP Regulations).",The regulator in its interim order has directed to impound Rs 4843.5 crore that it believes were gains made through unfair trades.,"“Prima facie, the aforesaid trading patterns employed by the JS Group fall foul of regulation 4(2)(a) and 4(2)(e) of the PFUTP Regulations and the schemes as a whole are prima facie a fraudulent device prohibited by section 12A of the SEBI Act and regulations 3(a)-(d) and 4(1) of the PFUTP Regulations.” Regulation 4(2)(a) of PFUTP deems any act to be manipulative or fraudulent if it creates false or misleading appearance of trading in the securities market.",neutral,0.5714479684829712

"After a brief lull, June saw more SME IPOs cross 100x subscription as sentiment revives",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/after-a-brief-lull-june-saw-more-sme-ipos-cross-100x-subscription-as-sentiment-revives-13243166.html,"June was the best month since September 2024 for SME IPOs in terms of the number of public issuances, with as many as 30 companies tapping the primary market, with nearly a third of the issues mopping up subscription in excess of 100 times, according to statistics from Prime Database. This is significant, as the last couple of months before June saw a slight dip in the number of SME issuances and even the subscriptions had dropped to a more realistic level. In June, a total of 10 SME IPOs saw oversubscription in excess of 100 times each, with four of them getting subscribed well above 200 times. Insight from Prime Database showed that SME IPOs of Sacheerome, Eppeltone Engineers, Suntech Infra Solutions and Adcounty Media India were all subscribed more than 200 times each. Further, issues of SMEs like Silky Overseas, Neetu Yoshi, Ace Alpha Tech, Mayasheel Ventures, Influx Healthtech and Monolithisch India all saw their IPOs getting subscribed more than 100 times each. Also Read: SME IPOs in 2025: A year of dazzling debuts and deep disappointments The trend in June was in sharp contrast to earlier months when both the number of SME IPOs and the average subscription levels remained quite subdued, or realistic, as many in the market said. In May, there were a total of 13 SME IPOs with only two breaching the 100x mark in terms of over-subscription. April was the most lacklustre month of the year with just four SME IPOs, none with such oversubscriptions – the only exception being Tankup Engineers that was subscribed around 89 times. Market experts attribute the SME IPO revival to an overall improved market sentiment that has been reflected in the mainboard arena too, as June was a busy month for main board segment with eight IPOs. “The overall market sentiment in June was relatively better when compared to some of the earlier months and that led to the jump in the number of SME IPOs and also the oversubscription levels,” said Pranav Haldea, Managing Director, Prime Database Group. In January, a total of 20 SME IPOs were launched, with 13 of those subscribed more than 100 times. Similarly, February saw 20 SME IPOs hitting the markets though only one – Chamunda Electrical – got highly over-subscribed at nearly 513 times. Experts advise that investors need to be cautious while investing in SME IPOs, as often the frenzy of subscription and listing gains becomes the primary reason for investor interest. “Investors need to be extremely cautious as SME IPOs are very small in size, and it does not take a lot of demand for the issue to get hugely over-subscribed. One should do enough due diligence before investing even though data has shown that most investors invest in IPOs only for the listing gains,” added Haldea.

"MCX to launch electricity futures contract from July 10, sees demand for risk management instruments",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mcx-to-launch-electricity-futures-contract-from-july-10-sees-demand-for-risk-management-instruments-13242789.html,"Leading commodity derivatives platform Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) said in an exchange filing it will launch Electricity Futures Contract from July 10 in an effort to meet the rising demand for structured electricity price risk management instruments. ""This contract is a step toward deepening India’s energy markets and supporting the broader goal of sustainable, market-driven power pricing,"" Praveena Rai, MD & CEO of MCX said, adding that the launch will address real market needs. The contract, which got regulator's nod in June, will follow Sebi's Daily Price Limits with an initial slab of 6%, extendable up to 9% on a given day. Initial margin requirement for the contract is a minimum of 10% or volatility-based margins, whichever is higher, said MCX. Client level position limits have been capped at 3 lakh MWh or 5% of the market-wide open interest, whichever is higher. There will be four electricity futures contracts - the current month and three future months. The first trading day will be the first business day of the launch month, and the last day of the contract will be the business day immediately preceding the last calendar day of the contract expiry month. Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) has more than 90 percent market share in electricity spot market and IEX Day Ahead Market (DAM) prices will be the underlying for MCX Electricity Futures. MCX said the launch is timely as the electricity sector has been seeing 'significant growth' along with the need to manage price stability, fluctuating demand, fuel costs, and other market developments. ""The Electricity Futures contract will help power generators, distribution companies, large industrial consumers, and financial participants with a transparent, liquid, and reliable hedging mechanism. It will also promote investors with a widely used commodity to add to their portfolio,"" the company statement added. Read More: What are Electricity Futures and how will they impact the power sector? Rishi Nathani, the CBO for MCX sounded very bullish on the commodity derivatives market and said the latest contract will help in price discovery and is suitable for 'all kinds of investors'. ""It is important both for volatility and also for electricity players to plan future production, so it is useful for both power producers and investors,"" Nathani said, adding, ""This is not just about trading any contract but about developing India's power transition."" Shares of MCX were sharply lower in trade, down by over 3.5 percent on July 8. MCX is launching its contract ahead of NSE, which will unveiling its electricity futures contract on July 14. On growing competition in the segment, Rai noted that their view is to keep it simple. ""Using the spot exchange, where IEX holds over 90% of the market share, gives a clear, transparent reference point. It allows any investor or participant to look at historical data to make informed decisions. They’ll be able to analyze how the electricity market responded during different scenarios: monsoons, exceptional rainfall, seasonal fluctuations, etc. This rich dataset will aid in forecasting, insight-building, and more accurate budgeting,"" she said. Rai added that she sees significant opportunity in the space for all players. ""Globally, the derivative-to-physical market ratio is around 3x, that gives you an idea of the addressable market size here. Of course, it won’t reach that scale overnight. It will evolve over time,"" she said adding that they are actively engaging with market participants and believe that broader industry involvement will drive awareness, participation, and overall market depth. ""At this stage, market share isn’t the key focus the priority is enabling the right ecosystem and success factors to tap into this opportunity. As this develops, we expect the market to demand more specialized offerings, such as renewable-linked (green) contracts or long-term agreements. These exist globally and can be adapted locally as the ecosystem matures with better awareness and stakeholder alignment,"" she said adding that there’s room for multiple players, and once the market deepens, competition will naturally play its role.

"Midcap, smallcap stocks tumble up to 6%: BSE, Angel One, Lupin among top losers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/midcap-smallcap-stocks-tumble-up-to-6-bse-angel-one-lupin-among-top-losers-13241462.html,"Broader markets recorded a notable decline on July 8, underperforming benchmark indices. The midcap and smallcap indices dropped nearly 1 percent in the morning, buoyed by multiple factors. The Nifty Midcap index has now extended losses for the third consecutive session, while the Nifty Smallcap index stood in the red for the second straight day. Sensex and Nifty meanwhile were flat with minor gains and losses. Capital market stocks: Capital market stocks led losses in the broader markets, as the fallout from SEBI's crackdown on Jane Street for allegedly using manipulative strategies to profit from Indian stock market indices continued to weigh. Angel One and MCX shares dropped up to 6 percent in the morning, emerging as the top losers on the smallcap index. CDSL shares meanwhile fell over 2 percent. BSE shares meanwhile were the top loser on the midcap index, falling over 6 percent. The selling pressure in the capital market stocks further intensified as reports suggested that the SEBI board is likely to consider linking link options and cash exposure. This will likely increase cash market liquidity, while curtailing options liquidity. CDSL shares also fell. Pharma stocks: The pharma stocks were also among the top losers in the broader market, as US President Donald Trump's tariffs rattled global markets. Trump on July 7 issued letters with new tariff rates to around 14 countries. The new import tariff rates will be applicable from August 1. Notably, the US President is expected to issue more such letters this month. Notably, the tariff letters and the expectations of more such letters in the future may have triggered worries over India receiving once before it can conclude its trade deal with the country. Aurobindo Pharma, Lupin and Alkem Labs shares were among the top losers on the midcap index, falling up to 4 percent. Notably, Macquarie has double downgraded Aurobindo Pharma to 'underperform' from 'outperform', and reduced its target price by 40 percent to Rs 1,010 per share, Zee Business reported. The brokerage also cut the target price for Lupin to Rs 2,350 apiece, but maintained its 'outperform' rating. Defence stocks: Some defence stocks were also among the top losers on the broader markets, as easing global geopolitical tensions cooled down the earlier rally seen in the segment. Solar Industries and Cochin Shipyard shares dropped nearly 2 percent each, emerging as two of the top losers on the midcap index. On the smallcap index, GRSE and BEML shares fell up to 2 percent. Other notable smallcap and midcap stocks which recorded notable losses include Paytm, IRCON, Go Digit, Kaynes Tech, MGL, Bharti Hexacom, Bandhan Bank, Bharat Forge, Ola Electric Mobility, Union Bank, Kalyan Jewellers and more. ""Our assessment of a large set of concurrent indicators shows that India’s macro recovery is still WIP. Consumption growth remains weak, barring some bright spots, and government capex growth is driven by a temporary weak base. Monetary transmission has yet to become visible. This does not affect our central thesis of a 2HFY26 recovery, although the lack of visible growth cannot be ignored. We turn cautious on the markets for now, with the Nifty anyway set to touch our Mar-26 target of 26,000. We think the broader markets will mark time before growth triggers become more visible,"" said Emkay Global Financial Services.

Amid the ongoing consolidation, we maintain our bullish view and recommend continuing with a “buy on dips” approach, focusing on stock selection based on relative strength,"" Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President at Religare Broking said. Trump mentioned that the US is close to making a trade deal with India. Experts say that if the India-US trade deal is announced, Indian markets will experience a relief rally. Even if the deal's terms differ from initial market expectations, the simple removal of uncertainty around higher tariffs should drive this positive response.

Broader markets were weak, with Nifty Smallcap 100 down 0.80 percent and Midcap 100 falling 0.64 percent. Most other sectors, including Realty, PSU Bank, FMCG, Infra, and Energy, also traded lower. Nifty Bank edged up 0.28 percent, while India VIX dropped 2.47 percent to 12.25, indicating reduced market volatility. As for individual stocks, Schloss Bangalore, the owner of the Leela Hotels chain, rallied as much as 5 percent after two global brokerages - BofA and Morgan Stanley - initiated coverage with bullish views, citing strong fundamentals and a promising growth outlook. This fresh optimism comes just over a month after Schloss Bangalore’s underwhelming market debut on June 2, when the stock listed at a 7 percent discount. Indian pharma companies dropped up to 3 percent as US President Donald Trump reignited investor concerns after sending tariff letters to several countries. The sharp fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty Pharma index down over 1 percent. Pharma companies derive a major portion of their revenue from US exports. Hence, Trump's elevated tariffs will likely hamper their margins.

"Auto stocks in red amid tariff uncertainty; Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor, Hero MotoCorp decline up to 2%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/auto-stocks-see-selling-pressure-amid-tariff-uncertainty-bajaj-auto-tvs-motor-hero-motocorp-decline-up-to-2-13241105.html,"Shares of auto companies declined sharply in Tuesday’s trade amid caution over US tariffs. President Donald Trump on Monday said the US was close to finalising a trade deal with India. ""Now, we've made a deal with the United Kingdom, we've made a deal with China… We're close to making a deal with India,"" Trump said, adding that countries not aligned with US trade terms had been sent letters outlining applicable tariffs. Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, and Thailand were among the nations that received these letters, signed by Trump. The Nifty Auto index was among the worst-performing sectoral indices on Tuesday, slipping nearly 1 percent. All 15 constituents were trading in the red, extending the index’s decline for the third consecutive session. TVS Motor Company was the top laggard, falling 2 percent to Rs 2,821 on the NSE. Bajaj Auto dropped 1.85 percent, while Samvardhana Motherson International declined 1.62 percent. Other major stocks, including Hero MotoCorp, Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki India, and Ashok Leyland also witnessed selling pressure, losing up to 1 percent. Tata Motors shares slipped as well after its subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) reported a 10.7 percent year-on-year decline in wholesales for the June quarter to 87,286 units. The figure marked a 21.7 percent drop from the previous quarter, in line with expectations due to the phase-out of older Jaguar models and the impact of new US tariffs.

Reduce Titan Company; target of Rs 3350: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/reduce-titan-company-target-of-rs-3350-emkay-global-financial-13241368.html,"Emkay Global Financial' research report on Titan Company TTAN saw growth moderation in Q1 with 17% growth in the jewelry business vs recent trends of ~25% growth. Also, LTL growth for TTAN in the early double digits is weaker vs 18-19% for peers. In our view, Street’s expectation of a high-teen jewelry growth for FY26 at stable margin is at risk, as the 17% growth in Q1 comes on a weak base (9% growth); the rest of FY26 has a strong base of ~25% growth, enabled by a 900bps duty-cut last year. Further, the revenue mix is seemingly weak currently, with higher growth in the low-margin coin sales and lower growth in the high-margin studded/plain gold segments. TTAN’s 1YF valuations at ~65x are demanding and leave limited room for disappointment. Outlook Given the risk to estimates, the increasing competition, mushrooming LGD players and deteriorating RoIC profile, we maintain REDUCE on TTAN with TP of Rs3,350 (50x Jun-27E EPS).

"Aurobindo Pharma, Dr Reddy's, Lupin, other pharma stocks tumble up to 3% amid tariff jitters",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/aurobindo-pharma-dr-reddy-s-lupin-other-pharma-stocks-tumble-up-to-3-amid-tariff-jitters-13241069.html,"The shares of Indian pharma companies dropped in trade on July 8 as US President Donald Trump reignited investor concerns after sending tariff letters to several countries. The sharp fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty Pharma index down nearly 1 percent to hover around 22,159 in the morning. Trump on July 7 issued letters with new tariff rates to around 14 countries. The new import tariff rates will be applicable from August 1. Notably, the US President is expected to issue more such letters this month. India meanwhile is negotiating a trade deal with US. The much anticipated mini-deal is yet to be announced, as certain trade subjects remain a source of contention between the two countries. Notably, the tariff letters and the expectations of more such letters in the future may have triggered worries over India receiving once before it can conclude its trade deal with the country. Pharma companies derive a major portion of their revenue from US exports. Hence, Trump's elevated tariffs will likely hamper their margins. This may have impacted the pharma stocks today. Aurobindo Pharma shares tumbled over 3 percent to trade at Rs 1,147 apiece in the morning, while Lupin shares dropped nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 1,925 apiece. Dr Reddy's Laboratories and Zydus Lifesciences shares declined over 1.6 percent each, while Granules, Sun Pharma, Cipla and Torrent Pharma shares fell over 1 percent each. Ajanta Pharma, Laurus Labs and Glenmark Pharma shares fell over 0.6 percent each, while those of Biocon and Alkem Labs were trading in the red with marginal losses. Bucking the trend, Divi’s Labs, Mankind Pharma, Natco Pharma, IPCA Labs, Gland Pharma and Abbot India shares were trading in the green. The pharma index has now extended losses for the second consecutive day, after a 10-session gaining rally. Notably, the fall in the share prices were fuelled by bearish notes issued by analysts. Macquarie downgraded Aurobindo Pharma and Dr Reddy's Labs to 'underperform' and 'neutral' respectively, according to a report by Zee Business. ""India needs to wait and watch and see what others have got, if you do a deal too soon, it could be an uneven one,"" a source aware of the developments told Moneycontrol. Notably, Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal had said last week that India does not broker trade deals on deadlines. ""An FTA (free trade agreement) should be a win-win. India never negotiates trade deals based on deadlines. Our focus is always on fairness and the country’s benefit,"" Goyal told reporters on July 4. Nomura noted that the Indian Pharma Market (IPM) grew 8 percent on-year in June, supported by an uptick in acute therapies. Notably this is the highest growth rate in the past five months. Normura said most of the pharma companies under its coverage grew ahead of the market. IPCA Labs and Sun Pharma grew 12 percent each, followed by 11 percent growth in Torrent, Dr Reddy’s Labs and Glenmark Pharma. Some analysts however feel that Trump's tariff may in turn benefit Indian pharma companies. ""Trump’s new round of tariffs — with rates as high as 40% and targeting a wide set of countries across Asia — has brought Indian pharmaceuticals back into strategic focus. While the India–US trade deal remains under negotiation, the pharma sector could find itself at an inflection point...The US is actively looking to reduce its reliance on Chinese pharmaceutical inputs, including contract development and manufacturing services (CDMO/CMO), where China holds an 8% import share. India, with its scale, compliance track record, and expanding API base under PLI incentives, stands well-positioned to absorb part of this shift,"" said Bhavik Joshi, Business Head, INVasset PMS. ""Still, the opportunity isn’t without caveats. A renewed push for 'Buy America' could complicate matters for low-margin generics, and any uptick in regulatory stringency may weigh on sentiment. Market participants should prepare for a scenario of selective outperformance — where Indian pharma players with diversified product profiles, strong compliance history, and CDMO capabilities could gain, even as others navigate familiar pressures from Trump-era policy déjà vu,"" he added.

This fresh optimism comes just over a month after Schloss Bangalore’s underwhelming market debut on June 2, when the stock listed at a 7 percent discount. BOFA Securities started its coverage with a ‘Buy’ call, setting a price target of Rs 520 per share, implying an upside potential of 28 percent from the last close of Rs 406 on the NSE. The brokerage believes that favourable industry dynamics and the company’s strategic focus on expanding its high-end hospitality portfolio will drive steady gains in both revenue and profitability. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Key drivers identified by BOFA include the performance of Schloss’s five marquee hotels, medium-term expansion plans, and a nearly debt-free balance sheet—factors that are expected to support robust growth. The stock’s valuation, pegged at 20 times FY27 estimated EBITDA, remains compelling, the note said. Morgan Stanley echoed the optimism, initiating coverage with an ‘Overweight’ rating and a higher target of Rs 549. According to the brokerage, Schloss stands to benefit from a prolonged upcycle in luxury travel, increasing demand for premium experiences, and its enviable portfolio of legacy assets. Morgan Stanley also highlighted that the company’s debt-light capital structure gives it the financial flexibility to self-fund its upcoming capex cycle. At about 10 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 424, higher by 4.4 percent from the last close on the NSE.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Dabur India, Indian Oil, Jubilant Foodworks, L&T Finance, Can Fin Homes, JK Lakshmi Cement, and others on July 8?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-dabur-india-indian-oil-jubilant-foodworks-l-t-finance-can-fin-homes-jk-lakshmi-cement-and-others-on-july-8-13239952.html,"The equity benchmarks finished flat after a lacklustre session on July 7, while market breadth was favourable for bears. A total of 1,667 shares saw selling pressure compared to 1,008 shares that advanced on the NSE. The market is expected to remain directionless in the upcoming sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Vijaya Diagnostic Centre | CMP: Rs 1,010 Vijaya Diagnostic Centre has been consolidating within the Rs 900–1,000 range for the past two months. In the previous session, it finally broke out of this range and closed decisively above it, indicating a potential trend shift. Supporting this move, the daily Camarilla monthly pivot chart shows an overlapping higher value relationship, reinforcing the bullish structure. Additionally, the daily RSI is comfortably placed above the 60 mark, lending further strength to the positive outlook. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 1,015–1,005 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,125 Stop-Loss: Rs 960 Varun Beverages | CMP: Rs 464 Varun Beverages has recently formed a Tweezer Bottom near the Rs 446–447 zone, which aligns with the S1 monthly floor pivot—indicating strong support at lower levels. Additionally, the RSI on the daily chart is showing an impulsive V-shaped recovery from the oversold region near the 30 mark, suggesting a potential shift in momentum. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 465–460 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 515 Stop-Loss: Rs 435 Sun Pharmaceutical Industries | CMP: Rs 1,679.9 Sun Pharmaceutical has formed a solid base in the Rs 1,650–1,680 zone, which coincides with the S3 Camarilla monthly pivot, signalling a key support area. This zone also aligns with a rising trendline and pitchfork, adding further technical confluence. These factors suggest that the stock is likely to find buying interest at current levels, and any sustained move above this base could trigger a fresh upside—provided broader market conditions remain supportive. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 1,680–1,670 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,785 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,620 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Dabur India | CMP: Rs 512.75 Dabur has provided a breakout from sideways consolidation, accompanied by short covering. Significant Put writing along with Call unwinding has resulted in the Put-Call Ratio (PCR) rising above 1; it currently stands at 1.04. Dabur is also trading above its maximum pain and modified maximum pain levels of Rs 500 and Rs 498, respectively, indicating a positive short-term outlook. Buy Dabur Futures in the range of Rs 505 to Rs 510. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 530, Rs 540 Stop-Loss: Rs 492 Indian Oil Corporation | CMP: Rs 153.75 The overall trend in crude oil prices remains negative, and with OPEC increasing supply, prices are expected to remain under pressure in the short to medium term. IOC has broken out from a sideways consolidation phase, supported by short covering. The stock has seen fresh Put additions and has moved above both its maximum pain and modified maximum pain levels, which is positive for the short term. Buy IOC July Futures in the range of Rs 153 to Rs 155. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 162, Rs 166 Stop-Loss: Rs 146 Jubilant Foodworks | CMP: Rs 684.1 Jubilant Foodworks is facing clear resistance at higher levels, with aggressive Call writing restricting its upward movement—indicating a higher probability of a downside from current levels. It is trading below its maximum pain and modified maximum pain levels, which is considered negative in the short term. Sell Jubilant FoodWorks Futures in the range of Rs 690–684. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 655, Rs 630 Stop-Loss: Rs 707 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital L&T Finance | CMP: Rs 207.77 L&T Finance is exhibiting a strong uptrend across monthly, weekly, and daily timeframes, marked by consistent higher highs and higher lows. A recent breakout from a bullish Cup and Handle pattern on the monthly chart, supported by a strong candlestick, signals renewed buying interest. On the weekly scale, the stock hit a fresh all-time high with a rising MACD, reinforcing momentum. This confluence of price structure and indicators suggests continued upside potential in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 233 Stop-Loss: Rs 197 Fiem Industries | CMP: Rs 1,975.2 Fiem has been in a strong uptrend since 2020, consistently forming higher tops and bottoms—indicating a robust long-term bullish structure. This month, the stock broke above its 2024 swing high with a strong bullish candle, and volume exceeded the 20-month average, confirming strong market participation. On the weekly chart, a 27-week correction has been swiftly retraced in just 8 weeks, highlighting aggressive buying interest. The daily chart further confirms strength, with the stock trading above its 20-, 50-, and 100-day EMAs, while the rising MACD indicates momentum acceleration. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,271 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,876 Can Fin Homes | CMP: Rs 820.3 Can Fin Homes is in a strong long-term uptrend, forming higher bottoms since 2018 on the monthly chart. A positive polarity shift from the February 2023 swing high on the weekly chart has led to a series of higher highs and higher lows. It is currently trading above its 12- and 26-week EMAs, indicating trend strength. The MACD remains in buy mode across timeframes, reinforcing the bullish momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 918 Stop-Loss: Rs 779 JK Lakshmi Cement | CMP: Rs 978.3 JK Lakshmi Cement posted a new all-time high last week, highlighting strong bullish momentum and a solid price structure. On the monthly chart, it has demonstrated a faster retracement—recovering a 12-month decline in just 5 months—signalling renewed strength. Last week’s breakout from a channel pattern (formed since November 2023), supported by a bullish candlestick and rising volumes above the 20-week average, reflects strong market participation and high relative strength. Additionally, the MACD remains above the zero line on the weekly chart, indicating sustained trend strength and continued momentum, further reinforcing the bullish outlook.

"Sebi study says individual investors down 20 percent in F&O trading, 91 percent still losing money",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/sebi-study-says-individual-investors-down-20-percent-in-f-o-trading-13239550.html,"Market regulator Sebi’s efforts to curb the Futures & Options (F&O) frenzy have shown some positive results. A Sebi study shows that individual investors in F&O have declined and losses have also widened. The Sebi study says still 9 out of 10 individuals are incurring losses in F&O trades. Sebi has done this study to assess the impact of its steps taken last year. Sebi, in a study published on Monday, said the number of unique individual investors trading in F&O is down by 20 percent compared to the previous year, but it’s up by 24 percent compared to two years ago. In the study, it is seen that traders with total turnover less than Rs 1 lakh witnessed the highest degrowth compared to the previous year. The same bucket witnessed the highest increase in unique investors in F&O compared to two years ago. The study indicates that the net losses of individual traders widened by 41 percent to Rs 1,05,603 crore in FY25 from Rs 74,812 crore in FY24, after accounting for transaction costs. The percentage of traders making losses in F&O remained broadly unchanged at 91 percent from the earlier study done by Sebi. The study also found that the turnover of individuals in premium terms in F&O is down by 11 percent year-on-year, but up by 36 percent over a similar period two years ago. During the study period of December 2024 to May 2025, the average daily traded value by individual investors in F&O witnessed degrowth of 11 percent when compared to the similar period in the previous year, and witnessed a growth of 36 percent over a similar period two years back. Index options turnover, year-on-year, is down by 9 percent in premium terms and 29 percent in notional terms. However, compared to two years ago, index options volume is up by 14 percent in premium terms and 42 percent in notional terms. The Sebi study says, during December 2024 to May 2025, average daily traded value in F&O witnessed a decline of 5 percent when compared to the similar period last year, i.e. December 2023 to May 2024. But compared to two years back, it witnessed a growth of 46 percent over a similar period two years back. In comparison to the above, average daily traded value in the cash segment saw a degrowth of 11 percent over the similar period last year and a growth of 91 percent over a similar period two years back. Within F&O, during the last 6 months, average daily premium traded for index options saw a degrowth of 9 percent or a degrowth of 29 percent in notional terms compared to a similar period in the previous year, and a growth of 14 percent or growth of 42 percent in notional terms compared to a similar period two years back. The study says India continues to see a relatively very high level of trading in F&O compared to other markets, particularly in index options. The Sebi study is based on the top 13 stock brokers in F&O with a combined client base of around 96 lakh unique traders. Sebi was concerned with the explosion in index options trading on expiry day over time; concerns arose around investor protection and systemic stability. Accordingly, Sebi announced measures to strengthen the equity index derivatives framework. Which were made effective from October 1, 2024, in a phased manner. Steps included rationalization of weekly index derivatives products, increase in tail risk coverage on the day of options expiry, rationalization of monthly index derivative products, upfront collection of option premium from buyers, removal of calendar spread treatment on the expiry day, and intraday monitoring of position limits.","The study also found that the turnover of individuals in premium terms in F&O is down by 11 percent year-on-year, but up by 36 percent over a similar period two years ago.","Within F&O, during the last 6 months, average daily premium traded for index options saw a degrowth of 9 percent or a degrowth of 29 percent in notional terms compared to a similar period in the previous year, and a growth of 14 percent or growth of 42 percent in notional terms compared to a similar period two years back.",Sebi was concerned with the explosion in index options trading on expiry day over time; concerns arose around investor protection and systemic stability.,"Within F&O, during the last 6 months, average daily premium traded for index options saw a degrowth of 9 percent or a degrowth of 29 percent in notional terms compared to a similar period in the previous year, and a growth of 14 percent or growth of 42 percent in notional terms compared to a similar period two years back.",positive,0.9273442029953003
"SEBI proposes easing of restrictions on business activities of Mutual Funds, floats consultation paper",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-proposes-easing-of-restrictions-on-business-activities-of-mutual-funds-floats-consultation-paper-13239291.html,"Sebi has proposed review of regulatory framework for the business activities of an Asset Management Companies (AMCs) of Mutual Funds. Sebi has proposed allowing mutual funds to act as point of presence for pension funds to act as global distributor of funds, subject to conditions. Sebi has also proposed relaxation in broad basing requirements, offering investment management and advisory services to pooled funds such as family offices or offshore funds with a few investors. Sebi consultation paper has proposed that, subsidiaries of the AMCs which are registered as pension funds may be allowed to provide Point of Presence (POP) service and receive the compensation allowed by PFRDA for such services. However, the AMC may be required to ensure that the interest of the mutual fund investors is protected and not compromised while providing such services. Sebi paper also said that, with respect to request of AMC or its subsidiary to act as global distributor of funds, presently, AMCs are allowed to market or sell only direct plans of the mutual funds scheme managed by them. Sebi, AMCs may continue to be allowed to register as distributor through overseas subsidiary. However, AMCs may be required to ensure that no commission or fees is received for such distribution of direct plans of mutual funds schemes of the AMCs. With respect to the funds managed and advised by AMC other than mutual funds schemes and outside India, it is proposed that AMCs may be allowed to distribute funds managed and advised by the AMCs other than mutual fund schemes through its subsidiary, provided such distribution activities and fund management activities are regulated by a foreign regulator or jurisdiction and follows the regulatory framework specified by such foreign regulator or jurisdiction. Currently, Regulation 24(b) of MF Regulations restricts AMCs from undertaking any business activity other than in the nature of management and advisory services provided to pooled assets including offshore funds, insurance funds, pension funds, provident funds, or such categories of foreign portfolio investor as may be permitted by Sebi. Mutual Fund industry association AMFI had asked for the review and Sebi as part of Ease of Doing Business has proposed the easing of activities of mutual funds. On the broad basing requirements, Sebi in its consultation paper proposed that, based on representation from AMFI, it was decided to review and consider relaxing the broad basing requirement and permitting AMCs to serve pooled non-broad-based funds as well, subject to strong governance and regulatory controls that would address any concerns related to conflicts of interest situations. Sebi consultation paper said, to address the concern relating to diversion of resources towards non-broad-based funds, it is proposed that AMCs may be required to ensure that the resources dedicated to pooled non-broad-based funds should be proportionate to the fee earned by AMC from such funds as compared to fees from investors in mutual fund schemes and that mutual fund investors are not made to bear the cost of servicing mandates for pooled non-broad based funds. Also to address the issue of front running by pooled non-broad based funds, Sebi has proposed that the principle of fair and equitable treatment requires AMCs to put in place a written policy that clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of various teams involved in fund management, order placement, execution etc., use an automated Order Management System with clear order instructions to employees placing order on behalf of AMCs etc., may be extended to cover investors across all pooled vehicles managed by the AMC, whether broad based or pooled non-broad based funds. Sebi has also proposed that to protect the interest of the mutual funds investors and to avoid any transfer of securities to or from mutual fund scheme on unfavourable terms, at this stage it is proposed that the transfer of securities between pooled non-broad-based fund and mutual fund schemes may not be allowed. Hence, fees charged from pooled non-broad-based clients may be mandated to be within a certain specified range. A range of fees may be prescribed for AMCs to charge from their pooled non-broad-based funds. To avoid any preferential treatment to pooled non-broad-based funds, charging of any performance related fees by AMCs may be restricted. To deal with risk of trading based on inside information of Mutual Fund operations, AMC will be required to ensure that the activity performed for pooled non-broad-based funds does not emanate from any information obtained through Mutual Funds operations. Also, any information used for the advantage of pooled non-broad-based fund should not put mutual fund investors at any disadvantage. Sebi has sought comments from all stake holders till July 28.

ESAF Small Finance Bank and Jammu & Kashmir Bank shares also recorded significant losses. The sharp fall in the share prices of the three lenders comes amid an overall downturn in bank stocks. Nifty Bank closed in the red at 56,949, with AU Small Finance Bank, State Bank of India (SBI) and ICICI Bank leading losses. Equitas Small Finance Bank Equitas Small Finance Bank reported provisional gross advances at Rs 38,304 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. This marked a rise of over 9 percent from the Rs 34,871 crore gross advances reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. However, its gross advances in the micro finance and micro loans segment declined over 34 percent to Rs 3,916 crore during the quarter under review. Total deposits, meanwhile, rose over 18 percent on-year to Rs 37,524 crore, while CASA deposits grew over 11 percent on-year to Rs 13,053 crore. CASA ratio stood at 29 percent, lower than the 31 percent reported in the year-ago period. The lender's asset quality worsened, with overall net slippage rising from 2.38 percent in Q1FY25 to 4.35 percent in Q1FY26. Micro finance segment saw the worst rise in net slippage, from 4.98 percent in Q1FY25 to a whopping 19.75 percent in Q1FY26. The shares of the company tumbled nearly 6 percent to close at Rs 64.11 apiece on July 7. ESAF Small Finance Bank ESAF Small Finance Bank reported a nearly 9 percent rise in total deposits to Rs 22,698 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. This however is around 2.5 percent lower than the Rs 23,277 crore total deposits reported in the previous quarter (Q4 FY25).

"Oil India, ONGC, others fall up to 5% as oil falls on larger-than-expected OPEC+ output hike",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/oil-india-ongc-others-fall-up-to-5-as-oil-falls-on-larger-than-expected-opec-output-hike-13238665.html,"Shares of oil refineries tumbled on July 7 as oil prices dropped sharply following a larger-than-expected increase in oil production for August by the OPEC+ alliance. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, also known as OPEC+, had announced over the weekend its plan to hike production by 5.48 lakh barrels per day (bpd) in August, which is significantly higher than the 4.11 lakh bpd monthly increase in output approved by the organization for May, June and July. Following the announcement, oil prices tumbled with Brent crude futures down 0.73 percent to $67.80 per barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude dropped 0.72 percent to hover around $66.02 per barrel, as seen in the morning, but rebounded later in the day. OPEC+ said the sharp rise in output was driven by 'steady global economic outlook and current healthy market fundamentals'. Goldman Sachs analysts now expect OPEC+ to announce a bigger and final 5.5 lakh bpd increase for September at its next meeting scheduled for August 3. The fall in oil prices will likely bear an impact on the margins of the oil refiners, which may have led to a downturn in their stock prices. Heavyweights Oil India and Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) shares closed over 1 percent lower each at Rs 440 apiece and Rs 241 apiece, respectively. Chennai Petroleum Corporation shares dropped over 4 percent to end the session at Rs 739 apiece, while Manali Petrochemicals shares plunged over 5 percent. Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals shares also fell over 3 percent. Analysts noted that the oil market was tight, suggesting that it can absorb additional supply. ""ONGC/Oil India’s total crude output is estimated to decline 0.7%/grow 1% YoY, whereas gas is forecasted to fall 1%/grow 3%. The scraping of windfall levy implies market-linked oil realizations for Q1FY26. Despite lower output, we estimate EBITDA will increase 17% QoQ for ONGC on lower expenditure profile; OIL is likely to see an 8% uptick due to lower opex and statutory levies. We estimate ONGC/OIL’s RPAT at Rs80.6/12.3bn during Q1FY26. We expect sequential improvement in NRL earnings on better GRMs and excise duty hikes,"" said Emkay Global Financial Services.

Jane Street and the secrecy around its co-founder Rob Granieri,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jane-street-and-the-secrecy-around-its-co-founder-rob-granieri-13238710.html,"Jane Street is globally in news because of the recent order of Indian market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). The 53-year-old co-founder of Jane Street Rob Granieri is also in news because of his alleged role in South Sudan coup. Interestingly, the secrecy around his profile is so much that there are no publicly available photographs of Rob Granieri . It’s intriguing that a proprietary trading firm, which generated $20.5 billion in net trading revenue in 2024, does not find a mention of its key co-founder in company’s website and there is not even a publicly available photograph. This is in contrast to Jane Street’s presence in global financial hubs. The website of Jane Street mentions, “We have more than 3,000 employees across five global offices. We trade a broad range of asset classes on more than 200 venues in 45 countries”. Interestingly, Jane Street website says ""intellectual humility"" is among its core values. It says ""staying humble allows us to question our assumptions and to update our views based on new arguments"". Also read: Sebi likely to probe if Jane Street violated index position limits in F&O segment Jane Street co-founder Rob Granieri’s role was also highlighted in legal proceedings in US in the Sudan coup. It is alleged that he funded AK-47s, stinger missiles and grenades to topple South Sudan’s government. This, even though Rob Granieri’s side claimed that he was duped as the support was for human right cause and not for any other act. As per reports, $7 million was transferred to one of the conspirators of Sudan coup. Jane Street’s name also came up in the case of former FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried as he was earlier employed with the proprietary trading firm. Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced for 25 years in prison for crypto currency scandal. In an order dated July 3, Jane Street Group was barred by market regulator Sebi for allegedly manipulating the indices. SEBI had directed impounding Rs 4,843.5 crore of alleged illegal gains and also put a debit freeze on bank accounts even though Jane Street has disputed the allegations of SEBI.

Among sectors, the FMCG index outperformed, rallied 1.73 percent, whereas the Media and Defense indices shed over 1 percent. Technically, after a muted open, the market hovered between the 25,400/83250 to 25,475/83400 ranges throughout the day. A small candle on the daily charts and non-directional activity on intraday charts indicate indecisiveness between the bulls and the bears. We are of the view that 25,500/83500 will act as an immediate breakout zone for traders. Above this level, the market could rally up to 25,575/83700–25,650/84000. On the flip side, below 25,400/83250, we could see a quick intraday correction down to 25,300/83000. Further weakness may also continue, potentially dragging the market down to 25,225/82800. The current market texture is non-directional; hence, level-based trading would be the ideal strategy for day traders. Vaibhav Vidwani, Research Analyst at Bonanza Today, Indian stock market closed with a modest positive bias despite early volatility and global uncertainties. The Nifty 50 ended near 25,461 levels, showing resilience after opening slightly lower amid concerns over the US-India trade deal and regulatory developments, including SEBI's interim ban on US quant firm Jane Street. The Sensex remained largely flat, reflecting cautious investor sentiment. The market's positive closing was primarily driven by sustained buying interest from domestic institutional investors, which helped offset pressure from global trade tensions and profit booking at higher levels. Key sectors such as FMCG, oil & gas, and realty witnessed selective buying, contributing to the market's overall stability. Looking ahead, market expectations remain cautiously optimistic. The near-term trend will likely depend on clarity regarding the US-India trade negotiations and domestic corporate earnings results for Q1 FY26. While global macro factors continue to inject volatility, steady domestic institutional support and positive sectoral performance may provide a buffer to the markets, enabling a gradual recovery and consolidation in the coming weeks.

Acme Solar shares gain up to 6% as firm places 3.1 GWh battery energy storage order,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/acme-solar-shares-gain-up-to-6-as-firm-places-3-1-gwh-battery-energy-storage-order-13238017.html,"ACME Solar shares gained more than 6 percent intraday on Monday after the company said it has placed an order for more than 3.1 GWh of BESS to procure high-efficiency and scalable storage solutions from Zhejiang Narada and Trina Energy. Shares of Acme Solar Holdings touched an intraday high of Rs 264.8 per share on the NSE, up 6.1 percent. The stock has gained after two days of consecutive decline. Later it pared some of its gains and settled at Rs 253 per share, up 1.37 percent. This marks one of the largest battery storage procurements in India to date and will support the deployment of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) across ACME Solar’s multiple renewable energy FDRE (Firm & Dispatchable Renewable Energy) and battery-linked projects, scheduled for commissioning over the next 12-18 months across multiple states in India, a company statement said. The delivery is planned in a phased manner over the next four to eight months of the current fiscal year. Importantly, the order value of these systems is well within the budgeted cost, enabling overall capex efficiency while maintaining focus on technical performance and supplier reliability. Moreover, the early procurement of these systems would accelerate execution timelines and enable timely revenue realisation. The advanced BESS equipment conforms to global standards, including IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) and UL (Underwriters Laboratories), ensuring best-in-class safety, performance and reliability. This significant order underscores ACME Solar’s commitment to accelerating clean energy adoption and enhancing grid stability in one of India’s fastest-growing renewable energy regions.

JP Power shares soar 18% post-AGM outcome: All you need to know,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jp-power-shares-soar-18-post-agm-outcome-all-you-need-to-know-13237988.html,"Jaiprakash Power Ventures (JP Power) shares rallied nearly 18 percent on July 7 after the company's AGM lifted investor spirit. The stock was further boosted after reports claimed that Adani Group is leading the race to acquire Jaiprakash Associates. Jaiprakash Associates shares meanwhile jumped 5 percent to hit the upper circuit. Real estate and infrastructure firm Jaiprakash Associates (JAL) was admitted to Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) in 2024, after defaulting on payment of loans worth over Rs 57,000 crore. Billionaire Gautam Adani-led Adani Group, Anil Agarwal's Vedanta, Dalmia Bharat and several others had submitted their resolution plans to acquire JAL through the insolvency process. Recent reports have claimed that Adani Group has now emerged as the leader in the race to acquire the company. The conglomerate's Rs 14,000-crore bid for the company has topped the list of five potential bidders, NDTV Profit reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the reports. Jaypee Group's real estate holdings include high-profile projects such as the 452-acre Jaypee Greens township in Greater Noida, featuring luxury villas, apartments, and a golf course. Other assets include Jaypee Greens Wish Town Noida, a sprawling 1,063-acre township, and the Jaypee Greens Sports City, which boasts a motor racing track along the Yamuna Expressway. The resolution process for Jaypee Group involves a committee of creditors, including major financial institutions such as the State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank and Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). JAL owns 24 percent stake in Jaiprakash Power Ventures. The company's shareholders approved key proposals during its annual general meeting (AGM) on July 5. Chairman Manoj Gaur addressed shareholders during the virtual meeting. Jaiprakash Power Ventures shares were trading at Rs 22.32 apiece in the afternoon. Nearly 66.90 crore shares of the company were involved in active trade so far during the day, which is nearly 7 times higher than the stock’s 10-day average volume. The stock has given stellar returns recently, rising over 1,000 percent in the past five years. The stock is currently up nearly 24 percent in 2025 so far. Jaiprakash Associates shares jumped 5 percent to hit the upper circuit at Rs 3.19 apiece on July 7. This stock too saw trading volumes significantly higher than its 10-day average volume.

"Boeing stock climbs despite Air India tragedy, safety concerns still haunt the skies",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/boeing-stock-climbs-despite-air-india-tragedy-safety-concerns-still-haunt-the-skies-13237818.html,"In a striking contradiction, Boeing’s stock has edged higher despite a deadly crash involving one of its aircraft. On June 12, an Air India-operated Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, killing 241 people on board. While the investigation is still underway, early speculation points to a possible engine thrust failure, with engines supplied by GE Aerospace. The tragedy has reignited long-standing concerns about Boeing’s safety record and manufacturing practices. Yet, the market seems unfazed. From the day of the crash on June 12 to July 7, Boeing’s shares have gained 1 percent. Investor confidence appears to be buoyed by growing optimism among analysts that the worst may be behind the embattled aerospace giant. On July 4, Rothschild & Co Redburn upgraded Boeing to a Buy from Neutral, writing that “after years of troubles, things seem to be taking a more positive turn for Boeing and the company appears healthier.” The firm pointed to improvements in financials, internal processes, safety culture, and production discipline. Also read: Sebi had to act in the interim stage, order speaks for itself: Tuhin Kanta on Jane Street The brokerage believes that if Boeing can accelerate deliveries of its 737 and 787 aircraft, it could add $1.7 billion in post-tax annual cash profit. That would push Boeing’s free cash flow above $14 billion by decade’s end—topping its previous peak of $13.6 billion in 2018. Just days before the Rothschild note, Bank of America had also upgraded the stock and raised its price target, signalling an unusual shift in sentiment. But Boeing’s baggage is far from forgotten. Earlier this year, a panel covering an unused emergency exit door blew off a new 737 Max mid-flight—investigators later found it hadn’t been properly bolted into place. The incident sparked renewed fears over quality control, coming just as Boeing was trying to recover from years of reputational damage. In 2024, the company delivered only 348 aircraft—its weakest performance since the pandemic. Its output has been repeatedly disrupted, first by quality lapses, then by labor unrest, including a major strike in Washington state that halted production at key factories. Read more: India Inc’s earnings outlook turns uncertain with no clear growth driver The echoes of past tragedies continue to reverberate. The crashes of Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines in 2018 and 2019, both involving Boeing 737 Max jets, killed 346 people and led to the grounding of the aircraft worldwide. Investigations revealed a flawed software system and serious lapses in pilot training—failures that deeply eroded trust in Boeing's engineering and corporate culture. Despite the stock’s recent resilience, the company remains under intense scrutiny. With the latest crash still fresh and questions around safety unanswered, investors are betting on a turnaround—but doing so in a landscape still shaped by doubt. Boeing shares closed nearly 2 percent higher in the previous session.

According to our DCF analysis (WACC: 11.2%), at CMP, PLNG is pricing in an unrealistic scenario of a 20% decline in tariff at both the Dahej and Kochi terminals in FY28 with no tariff hike thereafter, and 0% terminal growth. Additionally, the street narrative that competing terminals are taking away market share has: 1) not played out so far as utilization at competitor terminals continues to languish at 14-43%, and 2) overlooked PLNG’s strong scale, historical capex, and connectivity advantages. While concerns around a potential tariff cut in FY28 linger, we highlight that a sharp cut in tariff at Dahej in FY28 can lead to industry-wide pressure, as competing terminals were built at ~2x the capital cost (Dahej capex/mmtpa = ~INR5b vs ~INR9- 11b for competitors). This would further increase the relative attractiveness of the Dahej terminal, especially as its expanded capacity comes online. Outlook At 9.7x FY27 P/E and 4% dividend yield, we believe valuations are at absolute rockbottom levels. We move to a DCF-based TP (earlier 10x FY27 PE) and assume a 10% tariff cut in Dahej and Kochi in FY28, 4% escalation thereafter, 2% terminal growth, and 11.2% WACC, leading to a TP of INR410/share. While we build in full capex for the petchem venture, we value it at only 0.5x equity.

"Auto, IT stocks in red amid tariff uncertainty; Maruti Suzuki, Tech Mahindra shares down up to 2%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/auto-it-stocks-in-red-amid-tariff-uncertainty-maruti-suzuki-tech-mahindra-shares-down-1-13236545.html,"The shares of auto and IT companies dropped on July 7 as uncertainties around higher US tariffs and no trade deal yet continued to spook investors. The sharp fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty IT and Nifty Auto indices into the red, to hover around 39,004 and 23,949 respectively in the morning. The 90-day pause to US President Donald Trump's higher tariffs is set to expire on July 9, and the elevated tariff rates will likely take effect from August 1. However, India and US are yet to announce their bilateral trade agreement. Trump's 'Take in or leave it' tariff letters Trump on July 5 announced that his government will be sending letters to 10 or 12 countries, outlining reciprocal tariff rates. Describing them as ""take it or leave it"" offers, Trump said the letters would be sent out on July 7. The rollout is expected to conclude by July 9, and the tariffs will kick in on August 1. ""The money is going to come to the United States from August 1,"" Trump said while addressing reporters at Joint Base Andrews. Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal meanwhile said that India will not be rushed into any agreement based on external timelines. ""India does not enter into any trade agreement based on deadlines. We will sign a deal with the US only when it is fully finalised, properly concluded, and in the national interest,"" Goyal told reporters. Trump announces additional 10% tariff on BRICS nations: Meanwhile, Trump said during the weekend that he will impose an additional 10 percent tariff with no exceptions on any country aligning itself with what he called the ""Anti-American policies of BRICS"". This came as Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the summit. In a joint statement, the BRICS members voiced ""serious concerns about the rise of unilateral tariff"" and noted that tariff risks are hurting the global economy. India recently proposed retaliatory duties against the US at the World Trade Organization, saying Washington's 25 percent tariff on automobiles and some auto parts would affect $2.89 billion of India's exports. ""India reserves the right to suspend concessions or other obligations ... that are substantially equivalent to the adverse effects of the measure to India's trade,"" the statement said. The rising trade jitters and no trade deal as of yet put pressure on the export-oriented stocks, including those of auto companies. Maruti Suzuki shares dropped over 1 percent to trade at Rs 12,510 apiece, while those of Bharat Forge were down nearly 1 percent. Tata Motors shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. IT companies derive a major portion of their revenue from the US economy. The uncertainties around tariffs has weakened the US dollar, which will likely bear an impact on the export-oriented IT stocks. Tech Mahindra (TechM), Mphasis and HCL Tech shares dropped up to 2 percent. Infosys, Wipro, Persistent Systems and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. ""With the tariff deadline nearing, all eyes are on the anticipated US-India trade deal. Market participants remain optimistic about a favorable resolution, which could serve as a key catalyst for the next leg of the market’s upward trajectory,"" said Bajaj Broking. As the clock ticks toward the much-anticipated India–US mini trade deal, the mood across Dalal Street is far from celebratory, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head, INVasset PMS. ""Both Nifty Auto and Nifty IT indices slipped into the red in early trade, signalling investor caution around sectors directly exposed to Donald Trump’s latest tariff regime. With auto components facing a 25% duty under Section 232, and no fresh exemptions confirmed yet, the market seems to be bracing for a harsher reality if the deal misses the August 1 deadline,"" Dasani added. ""Unlike pharma, which remains tentatively insulated for now, the auto space has already taken the first hit. Companies like Bharat Forge, Motherson, and Tata Motors are staring at margin compression and possible demand deferrals from US OEMs. The bigger worry isn’t just the existing 25% duty but whether Trump’s “reciprocal tariff doctrine” leads to additional non-tariff barriers. For IT, fears stem from indirect exposure — delays in outsourcing decisions, potential visa restrictions, and a cloudier geopolitical landscape,"" he further said.

Senco Gold shares hit 5% upper circuit after strong Q1FY26 update,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/senco-gold-shares-hit-5-upper-circuit-after-strong-q1fy26-update-13236486.html,"Shares of Senco Gold were locked in a 5 percent upper circuit at Rs 367 per share on July 7 after the company announced a robust business update for the April–June quarter (Q1FY26). So far this year, the jewellery stock has declined by more than 30 percent, in stark contrast to the 7 percent rise recorded by the benchmark Nifty 50 index during the same period. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog In its Q1 business update, the company reported a 24 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in retail revenue, while total revenue surged by 28 percent YoY. This growth was primarily driven by heightened consumer demand during regional festivals and the company’s continued emphasis on expanding its retail footprint. As part of its aggressive growth strategy, Senco Gold inaugurated nine new showrooms during Q1FY26, raising its total jewellery store count to 179. The quarter was also marked by a significant rise in domestic gold prices, which averaged between Rs 86,900 and Rs 1,01,000 per 10 grams. This reflects a 32 percent YoY increase and a 5 percent rise compared to the previous quarter. This escalation in gold prices was attributed to global macroeconomic uncertainties, strong purchases by central banks, and other international market factors. Looking ahead, Senco Gold remains on track to meet its annual target of launching 20 new showrooms by the end of FY26. The company is also exploring the franchisee route to accelerate the growth of its lifestyle and fashion jewellery brands — Sennes, Gossip, and Everlite. This strategy is expected to extend Senco’s reach and diversify its customer base across urban and semi-urban markets.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, also known as OPEC+, announced over the weekend its plan to hike production by 5.48 lakh barrels per day (bpd) in August, which is significantly higher than the 4.11 lakh bpd monthly increase in output approved by the organization for May, June and July. After the announcement, oil prices tumbled, with Brent crude futures down 0.73 percent to $67.80 per barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude dropped 0.72 percent to hover around $66.02 per barrel, as of 10 am. OPEC+ said the sharp rise in output was driven by 'steady global economic outlook and current healthy market fundamentals'. Goldman Sachs analysts now expect OPEC+ to announce a bigger and final 5.5 lakh bpd increase for September at its next meeting scheduled for August 3. The sharp fall in oil prices will likely benefit margins of companies that rely on crude as raw material. Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) shares gained over a percent, while Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL) shares too gained nearly a percent in early trade. Shares of index heavyweight Reliance Industries were up half a percent at Rs 1,535 apiece. Bharat Petroleum (BPCL) shares however bucked the trend to trade in the red. Asian Paints shares gained over a percent, while Indigo Paints were hovering in the green with marginal gains. The rise in the paint and OMC stocks comes amid a muted market sentiment, with benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty trading with caution.

"Alabama utility commission allowed to hike prices behind closed doors, judge rules",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/alabama-utility-commission-allowed-to-hike-prices-behind-closed-doors-judge-rules-2025-07-09/,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Alabama's utility regulators can continue to hold closed-door meetings to determine price hikes, in an apparent departure from common practices in neighboring states, a circuit court judge ruled. The decision on Monday rejected a lawsuit filed by Southern Environmental Law Center on behalf of Energy Alabama, a nonprofit that advocates for renewable energy sources. The watchdog group was denied access to two meetings in 2024 where the public service commission decided how Alabama Power — the state's largest electricity provider — should adjust prices based on volatility in global fuel costs. The lawsuit argued the denial flouts both local regulations and regional norms. Montgomery circuit Judge Brooke Reid ruled against the environmental advocates in a one-page order after a hearing in June. She said the group's rights had not been substantially violated. At the June hearing, Reid said the commission’s “interpretation of its own rules should be given deference.” Christina Tidwell, a senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, blasted Reid’s decision in a statement on Monday. “While other Southern states have meaningful public engagement in fuel cost proceedings, Alabama Power customers will continue to be shut out of the process,” Tidwell wrote. The Alabama Public Service Commission has rules that govern how Alabama Power can change electricity prices to offset increases in fuel costs, which tend to be volatile. Those rules say that the public is entitled to hear evidence and participate in proceedings that adjust fuel costs to ensure these changes are “just and reasonable.” The lawsuit said there have been only two public fuel cost hearings since the commission’s current rules were adopted in 1981. By contrast, the Georgia Public Service Commission, which regulates a sister company of Alabama Power, has held at least 26 public formal fuel cost proceedings, according to the complaint. The last public meeting in Alabama was called because the 2008 financial crisis caused fuel prices to skyrocket rapidly, according to attorneys for the state commission. They argued that the commission hasn't technically initiated a new proceeding since that change 16 years ago, even though rates have been adjusted over 15 times since then, so they are not compelled to invite public input. Attorneys for the state also argued that the public has “plenty of opportunities for input” even without public meetings, because the commission publishes monthly reports on fuel prices online, and rate changes are subject to public appeal. Alabama Power is a subsidiary of Atlanta-based Southern Company, which reported $4.4 billion in profit in 2024, according to annual shareholder reports. Alabama Power serves about 1.5 million of the state’s roughly 5 million residents. Most Alabama residents get electricity through municipal or cooperatively owned utilities. In 2023, the average Alabama Power consumer was paying about $159 per month, compared to the statewide average of approximately $132 per month, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Alabama Power did not respond to an emailed request for comment on Wednesday afternoon inquiring about recent rates. After the ruling, Energy Alabama's executive director Daniel Tait said in a statement that the decision was “disappointing” for “Alabamians who have no choice but to pay the high cost of fossil fuels on their Alabama Power bill.” ___ Riddle is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

"Alan G. Hassenfeld, former CEO of Hasbro and whose family founded the iconic toy maker, dies at 76",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/allen-g-hassenfeld-former-ceo-of-hasbro-and-whose-family-founded-the-iconic-toy-maker-dies-at-76-2025-07-09/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Alan G. Hassenfeld, a renowned philanthropist and former CEO of iconic toy company Hasbro Inc., the maker of G.I. Joe and Play-Doh, has died. He was 76, according to the toy company. Hasbro, the nation's second largest toy company behind Mattel based on annual sales, declined to offer more details. Hassenfeld's family foundation, Hassenfeld Family Initiatives, wasn't immediately available to comment. Hassenfeld was born in Providence, Rhode Island and graduated from Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts. He received an undergraduate arts degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1970. Upon graduation, he joined the Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based family business in 1970. Hasbro was founded in 1923, by Hassenfeld’s grandfather, Henry. Known initially as Hassenfeld Brothers, it sold textile remnants but expanded into school supplies and later toy manufacturing under the Hasbro name in the 1940s, according to Hasbro's website. It went public in 1968. Hassenfeld rose quickly in the family business serving as special assistant to the president and worked his way up the rank s. He became one of the key architects of Hasbro’s international operations and spent extensive time traveling overseas. He was named executive vice president in 1980 and became president in September 1984. Hassenfeld labored for years in the shadow of his older brother Stephen. His brother’s death of pneumonia in June 1989 at age 47, however, moved Hassenfeld into the position of chairman and chief executive officer. Hassenfeld stepped down as CEO in 2003 and in August 2005, he retired from his chairman position and became emeritus chairman. He stepped away from that role last year. Hassenfeld was the last family member to sit on the board, according to Hasbro. “All of us who have ever had any connection to Hasbro today are mourning the profound loss of Alan Hassenfeld, our beloved former Chairman & CEO, mentor, and dear friend, ” Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks in an e-mailed statement to The Associated Press. “Alan’s enormous heart was, and will remain, the guiding force behind Hasbro — compassionate, imaginative, and dedicated to bringing a smile to the face of every child around the world. His tireless advocacy for philanthropy, children’s welfare, and the toy industry created a legacy that will inspire us always.” Hassenfeld was involved in many charitable and social causes both nationally and locally in Rhode Island. His concerns ranged from childhood hunger to issues involving refugee settlement in the state. As chairman of the Hassenfeld Family Initiatives, he oversaw the foundation's mission of globalizing safety and human rights within the area of children’s products; empowering women in developing countries; and enhancing the economy, education and business opportunities in Rhode Island. Hassenfeld was also founding benefactor of Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Providence, and his family’s contributions helped to establish the Hassenfeld Child Health Innovation Institute at Brown University.","Hassenfeld stepped down as CEO in 2003 and in August 2005, he retired from his chairman position and became emeritus chairman.","As chairman of the Hassenfeld Family Initiatives, he oversaw the foundation's mission of globalizing safety and human rights within the area of children’s products; empowering women in developing countries; and enhancing the economy, education and business opportunities in Rhode Island.","Hasbro, the nation's second largest toy company behind Mattel based on annual sales, declined to offer more details.","As chairman of the Hassenfeld Family Initiatives, he oversaw the foundation's mission of globalizing safety and human rights within the area of children’s products; empowering women in developing countries; and enhancing the economy, education and business opportunities in Rhode Island.",neutral,0.504423975944519
Tesla Stock Could Accelerate on New EV Tax Legislation,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/tesla-stock-could-accelerate-on-new-ev-tax-legislation/,"Some controversy has resurfaced in the stock market as President Trump rolled out the One Big Beautiful Bill, which will likely create a new wave of debt to be added to the United States economy. However, the main difference with this bill is that most of this newly injected capital is aimed at positive return projects rather than pursuits that won’t stimulate many areas of the economy. One of these areas is taxes; nothing stimulates production and spending like a more favorable tax positioning in any economy, which is where investors need to place their attention when it comes to understanding this new bill. Overall, there are numerous benefits in the details of the tax implications, but one targeted aspect will make some names in the automotive sector winners in the coming months and quarters. The most obvious one, of course, is Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA. Tesla has significantly increased its market share in the electric vehicle (EV) sector through cutting-edge technology and strong consumer appeal, positioning that will benefit it from the new bill's tax advantages for Tesla buyers. These themes are already influencing, and will continue to influence, the stock’s performance. Under the new legislative action, a tax break will be implemented for all vehicles assembled in the United States, regardless of where their parts are sourced, as long as the final assembly occurs domestically. With this in mind, Tesla is perfectly positioned to qualify its customers for this benefit. Considering how popular and accessible Tesla vehicles have become in the United States, any additional tax incentives—such as federal EV credits for U.S.-assembled models—could further boost demand. The potential savings on ownership costs may become more apparent to consumers, especially if Tesla highlights these benefits during the financing stage of the sales process. Following the new implementation, Tesla shares have increased by just under 1.5% so far this week, surpassing the broader S&P 500 index by 1.7%. Achieving this during a period of heightened uncertainty caused by ongoing tariff negotiations and other economic factors is no easy task. However, when it comes to potential upside, investors have seen only a fraction of what Tesla could truly accomplish in this new favorable environment, as this tax break catalyst has not yet been fully priced into the company’s valuation. Compared to other large-cap names in the technology space, Tesla offers a wide margin for investors to benefit from a “catch-up” rotation. As the stock still trades at only 62% of its 52-week high, it offers both upside and an attractive margin of safety, given the limited downside it could experience in the future. These are the sort of asymmetric returns that investors love to act on in the rare occasions that the markets offer them, which is why acclaimed Wedbush analyst Dan Ives decided to reiterate his Outperform rating on Tesla stock as of early July 2025. Not only does the rating convey an optimistic note regarding the new bill, but it also includes his price target of $500 per share, which would call for a new 52-week high, along with a net implied upside of 70% from the current stock price. What happens when the momentum for Tesla stock gets going could be confirmation that investors may already be too late. Meeting these expectations and surpassing fundamentals driven by these tax breaks, the stock's performance could trigger new buying activity from institutional investors who typically seek such breakouts and bullish momentum stocks. However, when these positions are reported, it will be too late for retail investors to take action. Currently, Tesla's 163.4x price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio places it at a significant premium over the average 23.8x valuation multiple in the automotive industry, and there’s a strong reason for this premium: a differentiated product, superior market share, and the right size to capitalize on these new tax incentives. The markets are usually willing to overpay for stocks they believe can outperform the rest of the market and peer group in the near future. It looks like Tesla has all of the right components for this to be the case moving forward, showing investors why this new fundamental change could fulfill the $500 valuation if not more. Before you consider Tesla, you'll want to hear this.","Tesla has significantly increased its market share in the electric vehicle (EV) sector through cutting-edge technology and strong consumer appeal, positioning that will benefit it from the new bill's tax advantages for Tesla buyers.","However, when it comes to potential upside, investors have seen only a fraction of what Tesla could truly accomplish in this new favorable environment, as this tax break catalyst has not yet been fully priced into the company’s valuation.","Considering how popular and accessible Tesla vehicles have become in the United States, any additional tax incentives—such as federal EV credits for U.S.-assembled models—could further boost demand.","Currently, Tesla's 163.4x price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio places it at a significant premium over the average 23.8x valuation multiple in the automotive industry, and there’s a strong reason for this premium: a differentiated product, superior market share, and the right size to capitalize on these new tax incentives.",positive,0.9339268207550049
Why Marvell Could Be the Smartest AI Bet Under $80,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-marvell-could-be-the-smartest-ai-bet-under-80/,"The artificial intelligence (AI) boom is reshaping the global economy, but for many investors, the most visible players come with sky-high price tags. The search is on for companies that offer strategic exposure to this explosive growth without demanding a prohibitive premium. This has drawn attention to the essential, yet often less hyped, companies that build the foundational hardware of the AI revolution. Marvell Technology NASDAQ: MRVL is a prime candidate in this search. As a leading designer of the advanced semiconductors that power data centers and AI networking, Marvell is integral to the industry's expansion. Following a significant pullback in its stock price through 2025, the company now offers what has become rare in the tech sector: a compelling growth story paired with a more down-to-earth valuation. The company's investment case begins when you look at Marvell’s price chart. Through the first half of 2025, shares have declined by approximately 35%, bringing the price below $75. This underperformance was not caused by a failure in the company’s strategy but rather by broader market headwinds. Widespread investor concerns about the global economy and speculative fears over potential new tariffs on Asian trade partners have created pressure on the entire fabless semiconductor industry, which relies on manufacturing foundries in the region. This market-driven price reset is what creates the current opportunity. It has pushed Marvell’s valuation to a level that stands out in the crowded tech sector. The company now trades at approximately 25x its projected forward earnings per share (EPS). To put that in perspective, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index carries an average forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) that tends to range between 34 around 40 depending on the timescale. Finding a key AI player trading at a notable discount to the sector average is uncommon. This dynamic, where a company’s long-term growth trajectory appears disconnected from its current stock price, is precisely the kind of setup that value-conscious growth investors seek. A compelling valuation is only half the story; a credible path to future growth must back it. Here, Marvell has laid out an ambitious and transparent multi-year blueprint for investors centered on dominating the most lucrative segments of the data infrastructure market. The primary engine of this plan is Marvell's strategic push into the custom silicon, or ASIC, market. As cloud giants seek to optimize performance and control the immense power costs of their AI models, they are increasingly moving away from off-the-shelf chips. Instead, they partner with firms like Marvell to co-design unique processors tailored to their specific needs. This creates a deep and very sticky relationship that is difficult for competitors to disrupt. Marvell's goal is to increase its market share from 5% in 2023 to 20% by 2028. Based on industry projections, achieving this target would generate $11 billion in annual revenue from this high-margin business alone. Beyond the development of custom chips, Marvell is targeting the entire data center ecosystem. The company plans to expand its total data center market share from 13% last year to 20% of a projected $94 billion market by 2028. This represents a clear path toward nearly $19 billion in annual data center revenue, which would be a potential fivefold increase from its fiscal 2025 results. This ambitious vision is grounded in a tangible technological advantage. Marvell is a leader in developing next-generation 2-nanometer (2nm) chips. This new platform is designed to deliver 15% higher performance while, crucially, consuming up to 35% less power than the current 3nm technology. In an industry where data center electricity usage is a primary operational cost and environmental concern, this efficiency is a powerful selling point. This tech edge is how Marvell plans to win over new clients, with a stated goal of expanding its custom AI customer base from four to ten by 2028, systematically de-risking its revenue stream along the way. For investors navigating the complexities of the AI market, Marvell Technology presents a clear and compelling case. The recent market-wide pressures have pushed its valuation to an attractive level, creating a potential discount relative to its peers. At the same time, the company has offered a transparent, multi-year roadmap for substantial growth, underpinned by a distinct technological advantage in a market that prioritizes performance and efficiency. It is this rare combination of value and vision that makes Marvell a standout opportunity for those looking to invest in the future of artificial intelligence.

However, while the bill remains a net negative for solar power companies, the Senate version has removed some of the more onerous provisions, and the industry may not be facing the death knell some executives feared. Today, we’ll look at which regulations did and didn’t make the OBBB Act’s final cut, and examine three stocks that can still thrive despite the new solar headwinds. Under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the investment tax credit (ITC) and production tax credit (PTC) for solar systems were extended by a decade, fueling the growth of solar energy adoption in both residential and commercial areas. However, the OBBB Act marks a swift reversal of many of these policies, including the abrupt cancellation of a crucial residential credit. Here are some of the noteworthy provisions for the solar industry: The Senate version of the OBBB Act, eventually signed into law, removed some of the stricter regulations against the solar sector, including an excise tax on imported modules, the most stringent timelines for commercial projects, and the cancellation of tax credit transferability. It still doesn’t bode well for solar as a whole, but these three companies should still be able to thrive in this environment. In stocks, there’s often safety in size, and NextEra Energy Inc. NYSE: NEE is one of the largest diversified clean energy companies in the U.S. No one produces more solar or wind capacity than NextEra (33,000 megawatts of operating energy in 2023), and its substantial output and focus on large-scale projects should help it navigate a less friendly regulatory environment. NEE shares look affordable based on historical data, and even more so when using forward projections. The stock trades at 27.5 times earnings, a tick below the 10-year average P/E of 29.1. However, the 12-month forward P/E ratio stands at 20.3, and this is expected to decrease to 18.8 by the end of 2026 and 17.2 by 2027. After a negative 2023, EPS growth rebounded 26% in 2024, with smaller but still significant projections of 7.2% for 2025 and 8% for 2026. The company missed revenue expectations in its Q1 2025 earnings report, but sales still grew 9% year-over-year (YOY), and EPS numbers matched analyst expectations. The average analyst price target of $84.55 still indicates upside potential of nearly 14% as well. First Solar Inc. NASDAQ: FSLR specializes in manufacturing solar modules and operates some of the world’s largest photovoltaic power plants. Despite the sudden solar phaseouts, First Solar’s focus on producing its modules and plants in the U.S. could give it a competitive edge in this new energy environment. First Solar’s thin-film cadmium telluride modules can be manufactured with 100% domestic components, freeing the company from tariff pressure and FEOC restrictions. Despite the bill’s harsh implications, this domestic dominance is partly why Royal Bank of Canada increased its price target from $188 to $200 this week. Of the 31 analysts covering the stock, 26 now have Buy ratings with an average price target of $228.69, implying an upside from current levels. Nextracker Inc. NASDAQ: NXT sold nearly $3 billion worth of solar trackers in the last 12 months. Trackers are devices that pair with solar panels to track the sun across the sky, much like a sunflower. They optimize solar efficiency by keeping panels perfectly aligned for maximum sunlight exposure. Solar trackers are primarily used in large utility-scale projects, which offer Nextracker some protection from the phase-outs of the solar tax credit. The stock also appears attractive compared to other solar companies, thanks to its affordable valuation and strong margins. NXT trades at just 19 times earnings, and it boosted net profit margins to 17.21% in the most recent quarter. The $679 million quarterly revenue also represented a 15% YOY increase, showing the company can grow while protecting its margins. Before you consider NextEra Energy, you'll want to hear this.","Despite the sudden solar phaseouts, First Solar’s focus on producing its modules and plants in the U.S. could give it a competitive edge in this new energy environment.","Here are some of the noteworthy provisions for the solar industry: The Senate version of the OBBB Act, eventually signed into law, removed some of the stricter regulations against the solar sector, including an excise tax on imported modules, the most stringent timelines for commercial projects, and the cancellation of tax credit transferability.","First Solar’s thin-film cadmium telluride modules can be manufactured with 100% domestic components, freeing the company from tariff pressure and FEOC restrictions.","Here are some of the noteworthy provisions for the solar industry: The Senate version of the OBBB Act, eventually signed into law, removed some of the stricter regulations against the solar sector, including an excise tax on imported modules, the most stringent timelines for commercial projects, and the cancellation of tax credit transferability.",neutral,0.8161649107933044
A Georgia election with few voters: Turnout is 'miserably low' in the race for utility regulator,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/a-georgia-election-with-few-voters-turnout-is-miserably-low-in-the-race-for-utility-regulator-2025-07-09/,"ATLANTA (AP) — Every time the door swings open this week at the county courthouse in the tiny south Georgia town of Statenville, six election workers have a moment to hope that someone is coming to vote. “Anybody that comes in pretty much has to walk by our office,"" said Renee Church, the elections supervisor in Echols County. But through noon on Wednesday, none of those passersby had voted in the runoff to choose either Peter Hubbard or Keisha Waites as the Democratic nominee for a seat on Georgia’s Public Service Commission. Welcome to a statewide election where almost nobody came. Through the first two of five days of early in-person voting, only 9,822 ballots were accepted. That's 0.13% of active voters, what Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer for Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, called “miserably low turnout.” Early in-person voting runs through Friday, with the election day set for Tuesday. Anyone can vote, except for the more than 63,000 people who voted in Republican primaries on June 17 including one in which incumbent Tim Echols beat GOP challenger Lee Muns. Waites was the top vote-getter in a June 17 Democratic primary, but didn't get a majority. That meant she had to face the second-place finisher, Hubbard, in a runoff to determine the party nominee. Barring an upswell in voter numbers, fewer than 1% of Georgia's 7.4 million active voters could cast ballots. The winner will go on to face Republican incumbent Fitz Johnson in November. Despite the low turnout, Hubbard and Waites continue to push, telling voters that breaking the Republican hold on the five-member body will mean a difference in their electric bills. The commission sets rates and oversees generation plans for Georgia Power, which serves 2.3 million customers statewide. Customers have seen bills rise six times in recent years, and a typical Georgia Power residential customer now pays more than $175 a month, including taxes. “If you don’t like the direction your power bills are going, then you have a choice. You could do something about it,” Hubbard said Wednesday. A green energy advocate, Hubbard touts his experience testifying before the commission and developing alternative plans that emphasize a shift toward solar power stored in batteries, rather than building more natural gas plants. “A vote for Peter Hubbard is a vote to put a commissioner on the Public Service Commission who brings deep experience, who can hit the ground running with novel ideas to drive down power prices while inviting economic growth to our state,” he said. Waites, a former state House member and former Atlanta City Council member, emphasizes that she would give representation to Black people and Democrats on the commission. In a statement Wednesday, Waites said her previous experience in office would help her “work with utility companies, legislators, and stakeholders to secure fair rates.” “I plan to lower energy bills by advocating for increased transparency in utility rate-setting, promoting competition within the energy sector, and prioritizing clean, renewable energy sources to reduce dependence on fossil fuels,” Waites said in the statement. It’s not like the low turnout is a surprise. Only about 140,000 people cast ballots in the June 17 Democratic primary, about 2% of voters statewide. Many Republican-leaning counties had less than 1% turnout in the Democratic primary, allowing them to activate a rarely used state law to consolidate early-voting and election day polling places to one location. A total of 76 counties triggered that clause to save money, according to the secretary of state’s office. Officials in Walton County, east of Atlanta, predict they would have spent $42,000 to operate three early voting locations and 16 election day precincts. Cutting back to only one of each, Assistant Elections Director Lisa Clark said the runoff will now cost $5,600 in a county where only 21 of nearly 79,000 active voters had cast ballots through Tuesday. “When it comes to public service commissioner, people don’t even know what a public service commissioner is or what they do,"" Clark said. ""So we were not surprised. We were hopeful it would have been bigger, but we were not surprised.” Echols isn't the only one of Georgia's 159 counties without voters in the early going. Also recording no ballots in the first two days were Chattahoochee, Clay, Glascock, Miller and Telfair counties, while seven other counties recorded one vote. But Brittany Reynolds, the election supervisor in southwest Georgia's Clay County, said Wednesday that turnout will rise there. “I do know we will have at least one vote at the end of the day because I plan on voting myself,"" Reynolds said.","We were hopeful it would have been bigger, but we were not surprised.” Echols isn't the only one of Georgia's 159 counties without voters in the early going.","“When it comes to public service commissioner, people don’t even know what a public service commissioner is or what they do,"" Clark said.","Officials in Walton County, east of Atlanta, predict they would have spent $42,000 to operate three early voting locations and 16 election day precincts.","In a statement Wednesday, Waites said her previous experience in office would help her “work with utility companies, legislators, and stakeholders to secure fair rates.” “I plan to lower energy bills by advocating for increased transparency in utility rate-setting, promoting competition within the energy sector, and prioritizing clean, renewable energy sources to reduce dependence on fossil fuels,” Waites said in the statement.",positive,0.7757052779197693
What flood insurance does and does not cover,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/what-flood-insurance-does-and-does-not-cover-2025-07-09/,"SEATTLE (AP) — Though natural disasters cycle across seasons and regions in the U.S., it’s often a shocking discovery for property owners how expansive and expensive flood and water damage can be when a major storm devastates their homes, businesses and communities. That’s because oftentimes insurance doesn’t cover what the policyholder thinks it does — or thinks it should. The disappointing surprise is that while the standard home insurance policy does cover fire and wind damage, even good property insurance typically doesn’t cover things like flooding and earthquakes, which usually require a special and separate policy for each. Here are the things to know about flood insurance. Most people who have flood insurance are required to have it. Although many property owners have the option of purchasing flood insurance, it is mandated for government-backed mortgages that sit in areas that the Federal Emergency Management Agency deems highest risk. Many banks require it in high-risk zones, too. But most private insurance companies don’t carry flood insurance, leaving the National Flood Insurance Program run by FEMA as the primary provider. Congress created the federal flood insurance program more than 50 years ago when many private insurers stopped offering policies in high-risk areas. FEMA’s Flood Map Service Center has an online tool to check your area. FEMA notes even a 1% chance of flooding is considered high risk because it amounts to a 1-in-4 chance of flooding over the life of a 30-year mortgage. Homeowners in high-risk areas who should have it sometimes decide not to get it. Someone who pays off their mortgage can drop their flood insurance once it’s not required. Or if they purchase a house or mobile home with cash, they may not opt for it at all. The rest of us are just rolling the dice, even though experts have long warned that flooding can happen just about anywhere because flood damage isn’t just water surging and seeping into the land — it’s also water from banks, as well as mudflow and torrential rains. Mark Friedlander, spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group, said only about 6% of U.S. households have a flood policy — primarily in the coastal areas prone to hurricanes. That rate has remained steady in recent years despite the increasing frequency of severe flooding events, including in areas that are not formally considered by the government to be high risk. “Lack of flood coverage is the largest insurance gap across the country,” Friedlander said in an email. “Ninety percent of U.S. natural disasters involve flooding and flooding can occur just about anywhere it rains.” Even if a homeowner does have flood insurance, the coverage may not be enough to make a policyholder whole again. FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program only covers up to $250,000 for single-family homes and $100,000 for contents. Renters can get up to $100,000 for contents, and commercial flood insurance will cover up to $500,000. There are concerns that such flooding coverage limits are not robust enough, especially at a time when climate change is making strong hurricanes even stronger and making storms in general wetter, slower and more prone to intensifying rapidly. And what typically happens to the people without flood insurance in a major storm is that they can try to recover some money from their standard home insurance but may end up in a fight to determine what damage is or isn’t wind versus rain, or even “wind-driven rain.” Don Hornstein, an insurance law expert at the University of North Carolina, said the line between wind and water is a thin but very clear line that technical experts can determine. Should there be a proverbial tie, the law favors the insurance company. “If the house was simultaneously destroyed by flood and, concurrently (by) wind, it’s not covered by private insurance,” Hornstein said.","And what typically happens to the people without flood insurance in a major storm is that they can try to recover some money from their standard home insurance but may end up in a fight to determine what damage is or isn’t wind versus rain, or even “wind-driven rain.” Don Hornstein, an insurance law expert at the University of North Carolina, said the line between wind and water is a thin but very clear line that technical experts can determine.","And what typically happens to the people without flood insurance in a major storm is that they can try to recover some money from their standard home insurance but may end up in a fight to determine what damage is or isn’t wind versus rain, or even “wind-driven rain.” Don Hornstein, an insurance law expert at the University of North Carolina, said the line between wind and water is a thin but very clear line that technical experts can determine.","And what typically happens to the people without flood insurance in a major storm is that they can try to recover some money from their standard home insurance but may end up in a fight to determine what damage is or isn’t wind versus rain, or even “wind-driven rain.” Don Hornstein, an insurance law expert at the University of North Carolina, said the line between wind and water is a thin but very clear line that technical experts can determine.","And what typically happens to the people without flood insurance in a major storm is that they can try to recover some money from their standard home insurance but may end up in a fight to determine what damage is or isn’t wind versus rain, or even “wind-driven rain.” Don Hornstein, an insurance law expert at the University of North Carolina, said the line between wind and water is a thin but very clear line that technical experts can determine.",neutral,0.7519276738166809
Senate confirms new FAA administrator at a time of rising concern about air safety,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/senate-confirms-new-faa-administrator-at-a-time-of-rising-concern-about-air-safety-2025-07-09/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Senate on Wednesday confirmed Bryan Bedford to lead the Federal Aviation Administration, putting him in charge of the federal agency at a precarious time for the airline industry after recent accidents, including the January collision near Washington, D.C. that killed 67 people. Bedford was confirmed on a near party-line vote, 53-43. Republicans and industry leaders lauded President Donald Trump's choice of Bedford, citing his experience as CEO of regional airline Republic Airways since 1999. Sen. Ted Cruz, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, called Bedford a “steady leader with executive experience.” But Democrats and flight safety advocates opposed his nomination, citing Bedford's lack of commitment to the 1,500-hour training requirement for pilots that was put in place by Congress after a 2009 plane crash in New York. Bedford declined during his confirmation hearing to commit to upholding a rule requiring 1,500 hours of training for pilots, saying only that he would not “have anything that will reduce safety.” Sen. Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Commerce panel, accused Bedford of wanting “to roll back safety reforms and unravel the regulatory framework that made the United States the gold standard” in aviation safety. Congress implemented the 1,500-hour rule for pilot training and other safety precautions after the 2009 Colgan Air crash near Buffalo, New York. In that flight, the pilot had not been trained on how to recover from a stall in the aircraft. His actions caused the plane carrying 49 people to fall from the sky and crash into a house, where another man was killed. Families of the victims of the Colgan crash pushed for the stricter training requirements and remain vocal advocates for airline safety. They joined Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer at a press conference at the U.S. Capitol to express concern about Bedford’s nomination. Marilyn Kausner, the mother of a passenger on the 3407 flight, said she and other families requested a meeting with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy after Bedford's confirmation hearing. Her husband, she said, was “discouraged” after hearing what Bedford had to say at his hearing. Pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, made famous for safely landing a plane in the Hudson River, also opposed Trump's pick, posting on social media that “with the nomination of Bryan Bedford to be FAA Administrator, my life’s work could be undone.” Republican Sen. Todd Young, who is also on the committee, called the 1,500-hour rule an “emotional topic” but maintained that Bedford’s approach to safety is clearly “analytical,” prioritizing what “we ascertain leads to the best safety for passengers.” “All you have to do is look at his credentials and his testimony to be persuaded that he’s the right person for the job,” Young said. Bedford has support from much of the industry. The air traffic controllers union noted his commitment to modernize the outdated system. Airlines for America, a trade association for major airlines, called Bedford a “superb choice.” And United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said, having worked with Bedford, he had “total confidence in his ability to lead the FAA.”","Sen.

Autodesk Stock Ready to Rip? Q3 May Be the Turning Point,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/autodesk-stock-ready-to-rip-q3-may-be-the-turning-point/,"Autodesk NASDAQ: ADSK can hit new highs in Q3 due to its cloud shift, AI adoption, and strong financial performance. The company persistently outperforms its consensus figures and provides favorable guidance, a recipe for positive sentiment trends that drive market action. In this case, the trends include steady analyst coverage with a relatively high number, 23, covering he stock, firming sentiment and a rising price target. The sentiment is pegged at Moderate Buy in early Q3, with revisions leading to the Strong Buy range and a significant price increase for the stock. The consensus in early July is for an 8% gain, sufficient for a new all-time high, with the most recent revisions leading to the high-end range, another 10% upside when reached. The long-term outlook for Autodesk is robust and aligns with the outlook for higher share prices. The company is forecasted to grow revenue at a slowing pace but to sustain a modest double-digit CAGR through the middle of the next decade. The top-line growth pace will be exceeded by earnings growth, and both the top- and bottom-line forecasts are likely to be light. Autodesk has outperformed its consensus more than 90% of the time and showed signs of accelerating in the latest report. Revenue grew by 15% compared to only 11% in the prior quarter and year, underpinned by client wins and penetration gains. Autodesk’s price action is at a critical resistance and potential pivot point in early Q2 2025. The market for this tech stock has moved up to retest resistance, aligning with the highs set in 2021, just below the all-time high, and may soon move above them. A move to fresh highs would signal a crucial market shift and open the door to a more sustainable rally. The market may experience turbulence at its all-time high in this scenario, but it is unlikely to correct significantly. Autodesk had a strong Q1, setting it up for a strong year. The critical detail is that strength in all segments, product lines, and geographies reflects little to no impact from macroeconomic headwinds. The takeaway is that the consensus outlook for F2026, robust as it is, likely underestimates the company’s performance by a wide margin. As it stands, the consensus is for Q2 revenue to grow by only 14%, compared to the 15% gain in Q1; however, revisions are leading to a high-end range and may continue to boost the consensus until the results are released in late August. The balance sheet highlights at the end of Q1 didn’t reflect improvement so much as stability and strength. The cash position was up, but reduced receivables offset that. Current and total assets and liabilities were flat, leaving equity flat compared to last year. Leverage is low, with long-term net debt less than 1x equity, and cash flow allows for modest share repurchases. Repurchases reduced the count by roughly 0.5% year over year in F2025 and matched the pace in FQ1 2026, providing some leverage for shareholders. The most significant risk for investors is insider selling. Executives have been selling all year, but the headwind they present is minimal; they own only 0.15% of the stock, while institutions pose a bigger threat. Institutions, which own about 90% of the stock, bought on balance in the first half of the year but began selling in Q2. The mitigating factor is that the initial reports for Q3 show significant buying activity in the quarter’s first week, suggesting a tailwind for price action that can help lift the stock price in the back half of 2025.

Customers seeking deals gave Amazon's Prime Day and competing sales a solid start,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/customers-seeking-deals-gave-amazons-prime-day-and-competing-sales-a-solid-start-2025-07-09/,"NEW YORK (AP) — The first day of Amazon's Prime Day event and competing retail sales that kicked off on Tuesday drove solid online spending compared to a year earlier, according to two data sources. Adobe Digital Insights, which tracks visits to e-commerce sites, reported that U.S. consumers spent $7.9 billion at online stores on Tuesday, a 9.9% increase from the comparable day last year. Retailers offered discounts in the range of 9% to 23%, on par with July 2024 sales events, Adobe said. Shoppers appeared especially eager to take advantage of deals on appliances, electronics and home improvement products, the data company said. Online sales of appliances were 135% higher than last month's daily average, according to Adobe's data. Back-to-school items also were popular. Spending increased threefold on school supplies like backpacks, lunchboxes and stationery, and was two times higher for college dorm fixtures like mattresses, mini refrigerators and microwave over, Adobe said. Amazon doubled the length of Prime Day to four days this year. Walmart also added two more days to its summer deals event, which started Tuesday as well. Retail analysts are evaluating this week's sales for clues on whether President Donald Trump's trade policy and unpredictable tariffs affect prices and consumer behavior. Adobe noted that strong deals drove many shoppers to “trade up” to higher-ticket items. Across all categories the company tracks, the share of the most expensive goods increased by 20%, compared to average levels year to date. According to consumer data company Numerator, the average Prime Day order on Tuesday cost $58.37. However, the average household cost amounted to more than $106 as of 4 p.m. Eastern time because 42% of households participating in Prime Day placed more than two orders, the company said. Numerator tracks U.S. retail prices through sales receipts, online account activity and other information from a panel of 200,000 shoppers. Physical stores in the U.S. may see spillover traffic from online sales events this week as budget-minded customers comparison shop in search of the lowest prices, according to R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai. The location data company tracks people’s movements based on cellphone usage. “We do still have a price-sensitive consumer that is actively monitoring price hikes and anything related to tariffs,” Hottovy said. Despite ongoing economic concerns, Adobe said it expected online sales to spur a record $23.8 billion in spending from July 8 to July 11, which would represent 28.4% growth year over year. Adobe’s numbers are not adjusted for inflation. However, the company said new demand, not rising prices, largely accounts for growing sales figures so far this year.

Do They Know Something? Insiders & Congress Buy UnitedHealth,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/do-they-know-something-insiders-and-congress-buy-unitedhealth/,"UnitedHealth Group NYSE: UNH has spent a significant amount of time in the sick bay for the first half of 2025, but it’s showing signs of recovery. Let’s get the bad news out of the way first. The Eden Prairie, Minn.-based company has fallen 40% year-to-date and has plummeted 42.2% in the past three months alone, with most of that decline occurring in April and May. Over the past month, UNH shares have remained relatively flat, with a 0.1% gain. Despite a turbulent start to the year, the healthcare services giant’s recent leadership changes and insider investments signal a potential path to recovery. And investors would be wise to pay attention: when executives are buying big, it often signals the bottom is in. So what’s ailing UNH? Primarily, UnitedHealth's stock has suffered over multiple downbeat issues, including a headline-grabbing cybersecurity attack, soft earnings, federal regulatory headaches, and the resignation of CEO Andrew Witty, who helmed the firm since 2021 (and who served as CEO at GlaxoSmithKline from 2008 to 2017). It’s the last issue that resonates right now, especially given the UNH share bounce back of late. Witty was replaced by former UNH CEO Stephen J. Hemsley on May 13, who immediately offered an interesting outlook on the healthcare company’s financial fortunes. “UnitedHealth Group has tremendous opportunities to grow as we continue to help improve health care and to perform to our potential, and, in so doing, return to our long-term growth objective of 13 to 16 percent,” Helmsley stated. Almost simultaneously, company insiders and Congressional leading lights began snapping up shares of UNH stock. Georgia Congressional Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene bought between $15,000 and $50,000 shares of UNH on May 14 and purchased between $1,001 and $15,000 on May 16. And she’s not alone. Texas Republican Congressman Michael McCaul purchased up to $50,000 in UNH shares on May 16, while Democratic Representatives Mo Khanna and Gilbert Cisneros also bought UnitedHealth shares, but did so in early 2025. UNH executives are stacking company shares. On May 16, Hemsley bought $25 million worth of UNH stock, locking in 86,700 shares at an average price of $288.57 each. Additionally, company CFO John Rex and Director Kristen Gill were substantial UNH share buyers on May 16, 2025. So what do Congressional portfolio builders and UnitedHealth’s C-suite know that the investing public doesn’t know? The answer is ‘nothing out of the ordinary,’ especially from UNH executives. UnitedHealth’s leadership has stated that the company is on track for robust growth by 2026, while Hemsley is expected to reinstate UNH’s forward financial guidance, which was previously abandoned by the previous regime due to a series of adverse news reports and sluggish earnings. In an early June meeting with shareholders, Hemsley said his team was committed to winning back their trust and confidence. He also promised to review underperforming company areas, such as pharmacy services and risk management. “With our second quarter report on July 29, we will establish a prudent 2025 earnings outlook and offer initial perspectives for 2026,” Hemsley told shareholders. “Across the enterprise, our pricing decisions and benefit designs for the next year are being fully shaped—with an abundance of respect—for the trend factors we noted in May and the environment we find ourselves in today and see going forward.” Another immediate focus area will be on pricing disciplines. Hemsley acknowledged past missteps in forecasting care activity and costs, noting that these errors led to unsustainable growth. The company is now overhauling its forecasting methods to improve accuracy and financial oversight. Moreover, Hemsley said UNH needs to move past problems with financial guidance, data security issues, and a U.S. Justice Department probe into alleged fraud, and focus on an operational and financial turnaround. Analysts believe Hemsley can do the job, giving UNH stock a consensus Moderate Buy rating. Of the 25 analysts tracked by MarketBeat, 16 have issued a Buy rating for UNH, with only one giving it a Sell. The average price target is $415.57, signaling a potential upside of 35.61% from where it is currently trading. UBS analyst AJ Rice is among the recent backers of UnitedHealth, even as he cut his one-year price target of UNH shares from $400 to $385 with a Buy call on the stock. He thinks the new management team's measured approach, especially on its upcoming guidance call, will pacify shareholders and promote stability to interested investors. “We believe the company wants to offer a new 2025 outlook that it can be assured of delivering and, therefore, we expect the number to be even more conservative than normal when all is said and done,” Rice stated in a recent research note. Before you consider UnitedHealth Group, you'll want to hear this.","The answer is ‘nothing out of the ordinary,’ especially from UNH executives.","UBS analyst AJ Rice is among the recent backers of UnitedHealth, even as he cut his one-year price target of UNH shares from $400 to $385 with a Buy call on the stock.","He thinks the new management team's measured approach, especially on its upcoming guidance call, will pacify shareholders and promote stability to interested investors.","“Across the enterprise, our pricing decisions and benefit designs for the next year are being fully shaped—with an abundance of respect—for the trend factors we noted in May and the environment we find ourselves in today and see going forward.” Another immediate focus area will be on pricing disciplines.",neutral,0.8685523271560669
The Czech Republic bans DeepSeek in state administration over cybersecurity concerns,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-czech-republic-bans-deepseek-in-state-administration-over-cybersecurity-concerns-2025-07-09/,"PRAGUE (AP) — The Czech Republic has banned the use of any products by the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek in state administration over cybersecurity concerns, authorities said Wednesday. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said the government acted after receiving a warning from the national cybersecurity watchdog, which noted a threat of unauthorized access to users data because the firm is obliged to cooperate with Chinese state authorities. The move follows similar steps made by some other countries that aimed to protect users’ data, including Italy, which in January blocked access to the chatbot, and also Australia. The Czech government in 2018 stopped using the hardware and software made by Chinese telecoms company Huawei and another Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE, after a warning they posed a security threat.

"Trump tariffs goods from Brazil at 50%, citing 'witch hunt' trial against country's former president",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-sends-out-tariff-letters-to-6-more-countries-but-he-avoids-major-us-trade-partners-2025-07-09/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump singled out Brazil for import taxes of 50% on Wednesday for its treatment of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, showing that personal grudges rather than simple economics are a driving force in the U.S. leader's use of tariffs. Trump avoided his standard form letter with Brazil, specifically tying his tariffs to the trial of Bolsonaro, who is charged with trying to overturn his 2022 election loss. Trump has described Bolsonaro as a friend and hosted the former Brazilian president at his Mar-a-Lago resort when both were in power in 2020. “This Trial should not be taking place,” Trump wrote in the letter posted on Truth Social. “It is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!” There is a sense of kinship as Trump was indicted in 2023 for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The U.S. president addressed his tariff letter to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who bested Bolsonaro in 2022. Lula responded in a forceful statement that said Trump's tariffs would trigger the country's economic reciprocity law, which allows trade, investment and intellectual property agreements to be suspended against countries that harm Brazil's competitiveness. He noted that the U.S. has had a trade surplus of more than $410 billion with Brazil over the past 15 years. “Brazil is a sovereign country with independent institutions that will not accept being taken for granted by anyone,” Lula said. Bolsonaro testified before the country’s Supreme Court in June over the alleged plot to remain in power after his 2022 election loss. Judges will hear from 26 other defendants in the coming months, and legal analysts say a decision could come as early as September. The country’s electoral authorities have already barred Bolsonaro from running for office until 2030. The former president did not comment about Trump’s tariff decision on his social media channels, but wrote that he is being politically persecuted. In his statement, Lula defended the country's legal system, saying the “proceedings against those who planned the coup d’etat is a competence of the Brazilian judiciary and is not subject to interference or threats that harm the independence of national institutions.” Trump also objected to Brazil's Supreme Court fining of social media companies, saying the temporary blocking last year amounted to “SECRET and UNLAWFUL Censorship Orders.” Trump said he is launching an investigation as a result under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which applies to countries with trade practices that are deemed unfair to U.S. companies. Among the companies the Supreme Court fined was X, which was not mentioned specifically in Trump's letter. X is owned by Elon Musk, Trump's multibillionaire backer in the 2024 election whose time leading Trump's Department of Government Efficiency recently ended and led to a public feud over the U.S. president's deficit-increasing budget plan. Trump also owns a social media company, Truth Social. “In Brazil, freedom of speech is not mistaken by aggression or violent behavior,"" Lula said in his statement. ""To operate in our country, every company, local or foreign, must be subjected to Brazilian legislation.” Brazilian lawmakers allied with Lula blamed Bolsonaro and two of his sons, congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro and Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro, for Trump’s tariff action. Sen. Lindbergh Farias, the whip of Lula’s Workers’ Party in the Senate, said on social media that the Bolsonaros “must be very happy to harm Brazil, our economy and our jobs.” The Brazil letter was a reminder that politics and personal relations with Trump matter just as much as any economic fundamentals. And while Trump has said the high tariff rates he’s setting are based on trade imbalances, it was unclear by his Wednesday actions how the countries being targeted would help to reindustrialize America. The tariffs starting Aug. 1 would be a dramatic increase from the 10% rate that Trump levied on Brazil as part of his April 2 “Liberation Day” announcement. In addition to oil, Brazil sells orange juice, coffee, iron and steel to the U.S., among other products. The U.S. ran a $6.8 billion trade surplus with Brazil last year, according to the Census Bureau. Trump initially announced his broad tariffs by declaring an economic emergency, arguing under a 1977 law that the U.S. was at risk because of persistent trade imbalances. But that rationale becomes problematic in this particular case, as Trump is linking his tariffs to the Bolsonaro trial and the U.S. exports more to Brazil than it imports. Trump also sent letters Wednesday to the leaders of seven other nations. None of them — the Philippines, Brunei, Moldova, Algeria, Libya, Iraq and Sri Lanka — is a major industrial rival to the United States. Most economic analyses say the tariffs will worsen inflationary pressures and subtract from economic growth, but Trump has used the taxes as a way to assert the diplomatic and financial power of the U.S. on both rivals and allies. His administration is promising that the taxes on imports will lower trade imbalances, offset some of the cost of the tax cuts he signed into law on Friday and cause factory jobs to return to the United States. Trump, during a White House meeting with African leaders, talked up trade as a diplomatic tool. Trade, he said, “seems to be a foundation” for him to settle disputes between India and Pakistan, as well as Kosovo and Serbia. “You guys are going to fight, we’re not going to trade,” Trump said. “And we seem to be quite successful in doing that.” Trump said the tariff rates in his letters were based on “common sense” and trade imbalances, even though the Brazil letter indicated otherwise. Trump suggested he had not thought of penalizing the countries whose leaders were meeting with him in the Oval Office — Liberia, Senegal, Gabon, Mauritania and Guinea-Bissau — as “these are friends of mine now.” Countries are not complaining about the rates outlined in his letters, he said, even though those tariffs have been generally close to the ones announced April 2 that rattled financial markets. The S&P 500 stock index rose Wednesday. “We really haven’t had too many complaints because I’m keeping them at a very low number, very conservative as you would say,” Trump said. Officials for the European Union, a major trade partner and source of Trump's ire on trade, said Tuesday that they are not expecting to receive a letter from Trump listing tariff rates. The Republican president started the process of announcing tariff rates on Monday by hitting two major U.S. trading partners, Japan and South Korea, with import taxes of 25%. According to Trump's Wednesday letters, imports from Libya, Iraq, Algeria and Sri Lanka would be taxed at 30%, those from Moldova and Brunei at 25% and those from the Philippines at 20%. The tariffs would start Aug. 1. The Census Bureau reported that last year the U.S. ran a trade imbalance on goods of $1.4 billion with Algeria, $5.9 billion with Iraq, $900 million with Libya, $4.9 billion with the Philippines, $2.6 billion with Sri Lanka, $111 million with Brunei and $85 million with Moldova. The imbalance represents the difference between what the U.S. exported to those countries and what it imported. Taken together, the trade imbalances with those seven countries are essentially a rounding error in a U.S. economy with a gross domestic product of $30 trillion. The letters were posted on Truth Social after the expiration of a 90-day negotiating period with a baseline levy of 10%. Trump is giving countries more time to negotiate with his Aug. 1 deadline, but he has insisted there will be no extensions for the countries that receive letters. The president threatened additional tariffs on any country that attempts to retaliate. ___ Savarese reported from Rio de Janeiro. Associated Press writers David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, and Eileen Ng in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, contributed to this report.","Trump also owns a social media company, Truth Social.","In his statement, Lula defended the country's legal system, saying the “proceedings against those who planned the coup d’etat is a competence of the Brazilian judiciary and is not subject to interference or threats that harm the independence of national institutions.” Trump also objected to Brazil's Supreme Court fining of social media companies, saying the temporary blocking last year amounted to “SECRET and UNLAWFUL Censorship Orders.” Trump said he is launching an investigation as a result under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which applies to countries with trade practices that are deemed unfair to U.S. companies.","Trump initially announced his broad tariffs by declaring an economic emergency, arguing under a 1977 law that the U.S. was at risk because of persistent trade imbalances.","In his statement, Lula defended the country's legal system, saying the “proceedings against those who planned the coup d’etat is a competence of the Brazilian judiciary and is not subject to interference or threats that harm the independence of national institutions.” Trump also objected to Brazil's Supreme Court fining of social media companies, saying the temporary blocking last year amounted to “SECRET and UNLAWFUL Censorship Orders.” Trump said he is launching an investigation as a result under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which applies to countries with trade practices that are deemed unfair to U.S. companies.",negative,0.7416655421257019
Mattel introduces its first Barbie with Type 1 diabetes,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/mattel-introduces-its-first-barbie-with-type-1-diabetes-2025-07-09/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Mattel has introduced its first Barbie representing a person with Type 1 diabetes, as part of wider efforts from the toy maker to increase inclusivity among its dolls. In an announcement Tuesday, Mattel said it had partnered with Breakthrough T1D — a Type 1 diabetes research and advocacy organization formerly known as Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, or JDRF — to ensure that the design of the doll “truly captures the community."" That includes accessories that “accurately reflect the medical equipment"" people with Type 1 diabetes may need, the California-based company noted. “Visibility matters for everyone facing Type 1 diabetes,” Emily Mazreku, director of marketing strategy at Breakthrough T1D, said in an accompanying announcement. And as a mother who lives with Type 1 diabetes, she added, “it means everything to have Barbie helping the world see T1D and the incredible people who live with it.” The new Barbie wears continuous glucose monitor (CGM), a device that tracks blood sugar levels, on her arm — while holding a phone displaying an accompanying app. She also has an insulin pump attached to her waist. And the doll carries a blue purse that can be used to carry other essential supplies or snacks on the go. The Barbie's outfit is blue, too — with polka dots on a matching top and skirt set. Mattel says that this color and design are nods to symbols for diabetes awareness. This new doll “enables more children to see themselves reflected in Barbie,” Mattel wrote Tuesday, and is part of the company's wider Fashionistas line committed to inclusivity. The line features Barbies with various skin tones, hair colors and textures, disabilities, body types and more. Previously-introduced Fashionistas include a Ken doll with a prosthetic leg and a Barbie with hearing aids. Mattel also introduced its first doll with Down syndrome in 2023. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 38.4 million Americans of all ages — amounting to about 11.6% of the U.S. population — were estimated to have diabetes as of 2021, the latest year with data available. About 2 million had Type 1 diabetes, including about 304,000 children and teens younger than 20. Barbie's new doll with Type 1 diabetes was also introduced at Breakthrough T1D's 2025 Children’s Congress held in Washington, D.C. this week, where the organization is advocating for continued federal research funding. This year, Breakthrough T1D has been particularly focused on the Special Diabetes Program, which is currently set to expire in September.","Barbie's new doll with Type 1 diabetes was also introduced at Breakthrough T1D's 2025 Children’s Congress held in Washington, D.C. this week, where the organization is advocating for continued federal research funding.","In an announcement Tuesday, Mattel said it had partnered with Breakthrough T1D — a Type 1 diabetes research and advocacy organization formerly known as Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, or JDRF — to ensure that the design of the doll “truly captures the community.""","Barbie's new doll with Type 1 diabetes was also introduced at Breakthrough T1D's 2025 Children’s Congress held in Washington, D.C. this week, where the organization is advocating for continued federal research funding.","And as a mother who lives with Type 1 diabetes, she added, “it means everything to have Barbie helping the world see T1D and the incredible people who live with it.” The new Barbie wears continuous glucose monitor (CGM), a device that tracks blood sugar levels, on her arm — while holding a phone displaying an accompanying app.",neutral,0.9230797290802002

"Robinhood Stock Gets 5 Price Target Upgrades, Signaling Upside",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/robinhood-stock-gets-5-price-target-upgrades-signaling-upside/,"Robinhood Markets NASDAQ: HOOD missed out on inclusion in the S&P 500, but the last thing the company is doing is focusing on the past. The firm just announced innovations that have Wall Street analysts swooning. Robinhood has been one of the hottest stocks in the market recently. As of the July 7 close, shares of the finance company were up 312% over the past 52 weeks. The company’s expanded product offerings and crypto trading demand have been key to its success. However, the company is far from done adding new features and growing its presence in different markets. That’s a big reason why Robinhood received five Wall Street price target upgrades in July. These aren’t just any upgrades, either. Several analysts increased their price targets massively, with one boosting its target by 100%. So, what is causing these analysts to become so much more bullish on Robinhood? Just how much upside do they see? Let’s dive in below. The increases in Robinhood’s price targets come after the company’s “To Catch a Token” event on June 30. During the event, the company unveiled new features, the most notable of which was the introduction of tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs for Robinhood’s users in the European Union. This is big for expanding the company’s international footprint. Before this release, EU users could only trade crypto on Robinhood. The tokenization route allows Robinhood to bypass the regulatory requirements for users to buy U.S. stocks. The release greatly accelerates Robinhood’s timeline for gaining traction in the EU equity trading market and creates a new revenue stream. It starts with 200 of the most well-known U.S. stocks and ETFs, but the company plans to expand this into thousands by the end of the year. The company’s new blockchain, Robinhood Chain, makes this possible. Robinhood Chain will expand to allow investors to trade many other types of assets. This includes real estate, art, and even the stock of private companies. Robinhood announced that EU customers could access private stock tokens of OpenAI and SpaceX. Expansion into these assets is another way Robinhood can grow its customer base, attracting more assets and revenues. Notably, these tokenized offerings are not available to U.S. users. The company also announced that crypto trading is now available in 31 European countries, greatly expanding access and further broadening its market opportunities. The MarketBeat consensus price target on Robinhood is just under $73. This implies a downside of over 22% from the stock’s July 7 closing price. However, the five price targets updated by the To Catch a Token event flip the script. Their average comes in at nearly $103, which signals that shares could rise by 10%, greatly altering the outlook on the stock. Overall, the average price target among these five analysts' upgrades increased by 28%, signaling the event greatly impacted their perceptions of Robinhood. Notably, Citigroup boosted its target from $50 to $100. One risk for Robinhood is the potential that the company is moving too fast. The firm has rolled out update after update, strengthening its ability to keep and attract assets. This is an exciting strategy, but it could backfire if the company does not execute its rollouts to a tee. One of the key reasons the Robinhood platform attracts customers is the top-notch user experience it offers. Maintaining this is paramount to keeping and growing its customer base. The company seems to have also stepped into a legal gray area with its private stock tokens. Investors do not actually own shares in these companies, and OpenAI has said the company does not endorse the Robinhood product. The Bank of Lithuania is seeking clarification from Robinhood to assess the legality of the instruments. Robinhood will need to avoid legal trouble as it expands its offerings to avoid damaging the trust it has built with users. Still, Robinhood continues to demonstrate a level of innovation and product expansion within the investment industry that no other firm is matching. This positions the firm to outcompete others going forward and grow faster than its industry if it can avoid the potential pitfalls of its aggressive strategy. This can allow the stock to continue winning.

Samsung unveils its new line of foldable devices at Unpacked,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/samsung-unveils-its-new-line-of-foldable-devices-at-unpacked-2025-07-09/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Samsung introduced several updates to its foldable devices lineup on Wednesday, with the new Galaxy Z Fold 7, Z Flip 7, and the new Z Flip 7 FE taking stage at the latest Unpacked event. The Korean electronics company unveiled the upgrades — including new versions of their watch — in New York but also announced an expanded partnership with Google to inject more artificial intelligence into its foldable lineup. Here are the biggest announcements from this summer's Unpacked event: The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is much thinner and lighter than its predecessors, coming in at 0.17 inch thick when unfolded and less than half an inch folded. It also weighs slightly less than half a pound, an impressive feat considering the company also increased the total size of the screens from the Fold 6 — now 6.5 inches for the exterior screen and 8 inches for the interior screen. The battery capacity remains the same as the previous generation. But unlike previous generations of fold devices, this one doesn't support the company's digital stylus. A 200 megapixel camera will act as the main capture and a 10 megapixel camera that extends along the frame of the phone gives users the ability to quickly capture wide shots. The Fold 7 will retail starting at $1,999. Pre-orders start today, and the device will hit shelves on July 25. The flippable cousin of the Fold has an enlarged 4.1-inch top screen and the clamshell folds down to just over half an inch. The inner display grows to 6.9 inches from the Flip 6's 6.7 inches. It gets a slightly bigger 4,300mAh battery and maintains a 50 megapixel main camera and 10 megapixel front camera. A new, cheaper version of the phone, called the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE was also announced today. It's a slightly smaller version — keeping the Fold 6's 6.7 inch screen size — of its premium counterpart. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 will retail for $1,099.99 and the Flip 7 FE starts at $899.99. Pre-orders for both devices began Wednesday and both will be available generally on July 25. The Galaxy Watch Ultra, Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic have all been refreshed with various updates — memory, thickness, design — but the main takeaway from today's event is that Google's Gemini AI was being preloaded onto the devices. Users can access the AI by speaking to their watch. Rick Osterloh, Google’s senior vice president of devices and services, appeared in a pre-recorded video at Unpacked to announce that the AI Mode of its search engine will be used in Samsung's circle to search function, allowing users to make quick queries by tapping or circling things on their screen. And Gemini will receive further integration with base Samsung device apps, like Calendar and Reminders.","The Galaxy Z Flip 7 will retail for $1,099.99 and the Flip 7 FE starts at $899.99.","NEW YORK (AP) — Samsung introduced several updates to its foldable devices lineup on Wednesday, with the new Galaxy Z Fold 7, Z Flip 7, and the new Z Flip 7 FE taking stage at the latest Unpacked event.","But unlike previous generations of fold devices, this one doesn't support the company's digital stylus.","It also weighs slightly less than half a pound, an impressive feat considering the company also increased the total size of the screens from the Fold 6 — now 6.5 inches for the exterior screen and 8 inches for the interior screen.",positive,0.8681793212890625

X CEO Linda Yaccarino resigns after two years at the helm of Elon Musk's social media platform,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/x-ceo-linda-yaccarino-resigns-after-two-years-at-the-helm-of-elon-musks-social-media-platform-2025-07-09/,"X CEO Linda Yaccarino said she’s stepping down after two bumpy years running Elon Musk’s social media platform. Yaccarino posted a positive message Wednesday about her tenure at the company formerly known as Twitter and said “the best is yet to come as X enters a new chapter with” Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI, maker of the chatbot Grok. She did not say why she is leaving. Musk responded to Yaccarino's announcement with his own 5-word statement on X: “Thank you for your contributions.” “The only thing that’s surprising about Linda Yaccarino’s resignation is that it didn’t come sooner,” said Forrester research director Mike Proulx. “It was clear from the start that she was being set up to fail by a limited scope as the company’s chief executive.” In reality, Proulx added, Musk “is and always has been at the helm of X. And that made Linda X’s CEO in title only, which is a very tough position to be in, especially for someone of Linda’s talents.” Musk hired Yaccarino, a veteran ad executive, in May 2023 after buying Twitter for $44 billion in late 2022 and cutting most of its staff. He said at the time that Yaccarino’s role would be focused mainly on running the company’s business operations, leaving him to focus on product design and new technology. Before announcing her hiring, Musk said whoever took over as the company’s CEO “ must like pain a lot.” In accepting the job, Yaccarino was taking on the challenge of getting big brands back to advertising on the social media platform after months of upheaval following Musk's takeover. She also had to work in a supporting role to Musk's outsized persona on and off of X as he loosened content moderation rules in the name of free speech and restored accounts previously banned by the social media platform. “Being the CEO of X was always going to be a tough job, and Yaccarino lasted in the role longer than many expected. Faced with a mercurial owner who never fully stepped away from the helm and continued to use the platform as his personal megaphone, Yaccarino had to try to run the business while also regularly putting out fires,"" said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. Yaccarino's future at X became unclear earlier this year after Musk merged the social media platform with his artificial intelligence company, xAI. And the advertising issues have not subsided. Since Musk's takeover, a number of companies had pulled back on ad spending — the platform’s chief source of revenue — over concerns that Musk’s thinning of content restrictions was enabling hateful and toxic speech to flourish. Most recently, an update to Grok led to a flood of antisemitic commentary from the chatbot this week that included praise of Adolf Hitler. “We are aware of recent posts made by Grok and are actively working to remove the inappropriate posts,” the Grok account posted on X early Wednesday, without being more specific. Some experts have tied Grok's behavior to Musk's deliberate efforts to mold Grok as an alternative to chatbots he considers too “woke,” such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. In late June, he invited X users to help train the chatbot on their commentary in a way that invited a flood of racist responses and conspiracy theories. “Please reply to this post with divisive facts for @Grok training,” Musk said in the June 21 post. “By this I mean things that are politically incorrect, but nonetheless factually true.” A similar instruction was later baked into Grok's “prompts” that instruct it on how to respond, which told the chatbot to “not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated.” That part of the instructions was later deleted. “To me, this has all the fingerprints of Elon’s involvement,” said Talia Ringer, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Yaccarino has not publicly commented on the latest hate speech controversy. She has, at times, ardently defended Musk's approach, including in a lawsuit against liberal advocacy group Media Matters for America over a report that claimed leading advertisers’ posts on X were appearing alongside neo-Nazi and white nationalist content. The report led some advertisers to pause their activity on X. A federal judge last year dismissed X's lawsuit against another nonprofit, the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which has documented the increase in hate speech on the site since it was acquired by Musk. X is also in an ongoing legal dispute with major advertisers — including CVS, Mars, Lego, Nestle, Shell and Tyson Foods — over what it has alleged was a “massive advertiser boycott” that deprived the company of billions of dollars in revenue and violated antitrust laws. Enberg said that, ""to a degree, Yaccarino accomplished what she was hired to do."" Emarketer expects X’s ad business to return to growth in 2025 after more than halving between 2022 and 2023 following Musk’s takeover. But, she added, ""the reasons for X’s ad recovery are complicated, and Yaccarino was unable to restore the platform’s reputation among advertisers.” Analysts have said that some advertisers may have returned to X to avoid alienating Trump supporters during the height of Musk's affiliation with the president and his base. Legal threats may have also played a part — whether from X or from the Federal Trade Commission, which is investigating Media Matters over its reporting that hateful content has increased on X since Musk took over, resulting in an advertiser exodus. Media Matters has in turn sued the FTC, claiming it seeks to punish protected speech.","Yaccarino posted a positive message Wednesday about her tenure at the company formerly known as Twitter and said “the best is yet to come as X enters a new chapter with” Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI, maker of the chatbot Grok.","And that made Linda X’s CEO in title only, which is a very tough position to be in, especially for someone of Linda’s talents.” Musk hired Yaccarino, a veteran ad executive, in May 2023 after buying Twitter for $44 billion in late 2022 and cutting most of its staff.","Yaccarino's future at X became unclear earlier this year after Musk merged the social media platform with his artificial intelligence company, xAI.","But, she added, ""the reasons for X’s ad recovery are complicated, and Yaccarino was unable to restore the platform’s reputation among advertisers.” Analysts have said that some advertisers may have returned to X to avoid alienating Trump supporters during the height of Musk's affiliation with the president and his base.",negative,0.8154309391975403

Zscaler or CrowdStrike: Which Is the Better Buy in 2025?,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/zscaler-or-crowdstrike-which-is-the-better-buy-in-2025/,"Zscaler NASDAQ: ZS and CrowdStrike NASDAQ: CRWD are both buyable stocks supported by robust trends promising to drive a solid double-digit revenue CAGR for years. They both grow at an above-industry pace and are well-positioned in an industry projected to grow slower than the pace of threats it intends to prevent. Cybersecurity growth is forecasted to have a 9% CAGR, compared to the 15% CAGR driven by cyber threats. The problem is that one of these markets is already pricing much of the growth. The takeaway is that both are well-supported and have a long runway for success, but one is a better buy in 2025 due to market dynamics. Where one stock is moving up from its low, on track to retest its long-term highs, and driven by analyst trends, the other is already well above the comparable highs and extended, with analysts trimming their sentiment. The better buy is Zscaler, with potential for a double-digit increase this year and next, while the poorer is CrowdStrike, set up to pull back and offer a more attractive entry later this year. To be fair, CrowdStrike’s headwind is minimal, but it is a factor that investors and traders should take note of. As of early July, the analysts' trends are bullish but reflect a more cautious tone than last year. There are an increasing number of Sell and Hold ratings, a declining number of Buys, and a 10% downside at the consensus. The June activity includes two downgrades from Outperform/Overweight levels to Hold/Neutral equivalents, and more are expected. CrowdStrike is a solid growth company, but it is highly valued at over 55x the 2030 EPS outlook. Zscaler’s analyst trends are far more robust and capable of driving its share price even higher. The June and early July activity includes numerous price target increases, upgrades, and no reductions. The net result is increased coverage, a firmer Moderate Buy rating, and 5% increase in the consensus price target. The consensus lags behind the price action in early July, but by a narrower 5% margin, and is rising, providing support for the market. The range of June/July targets positions Zscaler stock well above the broad consensus and near the high end of $385, a new all-time high when reached. CrowdStrike’s chart action isn’t overtly bearish but offers risk to new investors. The market is trading at an all-time high with diminishing analyst support and indications that it is overbought. The caveat is that institutional support remains solid, with them buying on balance in Q1 and Q2. The likely outcome is that a price pullback will catalyze a buying opportunity, and the price action will not correct significantly. The risk for investors is that CRWD shares will enter a protracted consolidation and trading range that could last until earnings catch up with the valuation or the outlook is improved. Zscaler's price action, on the other hand, is overtly bullish. The market for this stock rallied strongly in Q2 and is waving a bull flag in early Q3. The Bull Flag is a continuation pattern signaling that the rally is, at best, half over. In this scenario, the market for Zscaler stock can advance by another $150 and easily surpass the analyst's highest target. The catalyst for Zscaler’s new highs will likely be its Q4 earnings report. The company issued favorable guidance at the end of Q3 and showed signs of growing momentum, suggesting that outperformance is possible. Those include the calculated billings and deferred revenue, which grew faster than reported revenue, the increased client count, and strength in AI-focused security. Before you consider Zscaler, you'll want to hear this.","The consensus lags behind the price action in early July, but by a narrower 5% margin, and is rising, providing support for the market.","Where one stock is moving up from its low, on track to retest its long-term highs, and driven by analyst trends, the other is already well above the comparable highs and extended, with analysts trimming their sentiment.","As of early July, the analysts' trends are bullish but reflect a more cautious tone than last year.","The better buy is Zscaler, with potential for a double-digit increase this year and next, while the poorer is CrowdStrike, set up to pull back and offer a more attractive entry later this year.",positive,0.8651577234268188
Franck Sorbier fuses Andean splendor with Parisian pageantry on couture runway,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/franck-sorbier-fuses-andean-splendor-with-parisian-pageantry-on-couture-runway-2025-07-09/,"PARIS (AP) — Franck Sorbier, the Paris couturier officially inducted into the haute couture fold in 2005, delivered a regal, Inca-inspired spectacle on Wednesday that fused theater and artistry with the cosmopolitan codes of couture. The show’s standout image was a model crowned in gold, wielding a giant sun-topped staff—a visual exclamation point for a collection steeped in pageantry and myth. Sorbier’s silhouettes had a historic weight, with loose, voluminous skirts swirling beneath strict, structured bodices, conjuring a sense of ceremony. Gilded chainmail and coin-like embellishments suggested a protective armor, but rendered in delicate, sleeveless forms. A poncho, fringed in sumptuous gold, mixed Andean spirit with Parisian panache—while elsewhere, lush, unfurling coats were embroidered with organic, figurative motifs that seemed to grow across the fabric. Detail shone throughout: dense ruffles poking from the bottom of old-world shirts, rich shawls cascading with embellishment, and surfaces that rewarded a second, closer look. Sorbier’s backdrop was equally arresting — a landscape of bubbling, volcanic fabric, amorphous and vividly alive, underscoring his ability to transform couture into a living tableau. Known for merging cultural narratives with technical virtuosity, Sorbier proved once more that Paris couture can look backward and outward, drawing inspiration from global myth while staying rigorously hand-crafted. Through this cross-cultural lens, Sorbier’s latest collection stood as a bold reminder that couture, at its best, is both spectacle and narrative.","PARIS (AP) — Franck Sorbier, the Paris couturier officially inducted into the haute couture fold in 2005, delivered a regal, Inca-inspired spectacle on Wednesday that fused theater and artistry with the cosmopolitan codes of couture.","PARIS (AP) — Franck Sorbier, the Paris couturier officially inducted into the haute couture fold in 2005, delivered a regal, Inca-inspired spectacle on Wednesday that fused theater and artistry with the cosmopolitan codes of couture.","Known for merging cultural narratives with technical virtuosity, Sorbier proved once more that Paris couture can look backward and outward, drawing inspiration from global myth while staying rigorously hand-crafted.","PARIS (AP) — Franck Sorbier, the Paris couturier officially inducted into the haute couture fold in 2005, delivered a regal, Inca-inspired spectacle on Wednesday that fused theater and artistry with the cosmopolitan codes of couture.",neutral,0.8234184980392456
Trump appointees have ties to companies that stand to benefit from privatizing weather forecasts,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-appointees-have-ties-to-companies-that-stand-to-benefit-from-privatizing-weather-forecasts-2025-07-09/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — As commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick oversees the U.S. government’s vast efforts to monitor and predict the weather. The billionaire also ran a financial firm, which he recently left in the control of his adult sons, that stands to benefit if President Donald Trump’s administration follows through on a decade-long Republican effort to privatize government weather forecasting. Deadly flooding in Texas has drawn a spotlight to budget cuts and staff reductions at the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, agencies housed within the Commerce Department that provide the public with free climate and weather data that can be crucial during natural disasters. What’s drawn less attention is how the downsizing appears to be part of an effort to privatize the work of such agencies. In several instances, the companies poised to step into the void have deep ties to people tapped by Trump to run weather-related agencies. Privatization would diminish a central role the federal government has played in weather forecasting since the 1800s, which experts say poses a particular harm for those who may not be able to afford commercial weather data. The effort also reveals the difficulty wealthy members of Trump’s Cabinet have in freeing themselves from conflicts, even if they have met the letter of federal ethics law. “It’s the most insidious aspect of this: Are we really talking about making weather products available only to those who can afford it?” said Rick Spinrad, who served as NOAA administrator under President Joe Biden, a Democrat. The Commerce Department said in a statement that Lutnick has “fully complied with the terms of his ethics agreement with respect to divesture and recusals and will continue to do so.” Privatizing weather agencies has been an aim of Republicans. During Trump’s first presidency, he signed a bill to utilize more private weather data. Project 2025, a proposed blueprint for Trump’s second presidency that was co-authored by his budget director, calls for the NOAA to be broken up and for the weather service to “fully commercialize its forecasting operations.” Lutnick is not the only one Trump nominated for a key post with close relationships to companies involved in the gathering of weather data. Trump’s pick to lead the NOAA, Neil Jacobs, was chief atmospheric scientist for Panasonic Weather Solutions and is a proponent of privatization. The president’s nominee for another top NOAA post, Taylor Jordan, is a lobbyist for weather-related clients. Jordan and Jacobs ""will follow the law and rely on the advice of the Department’s ethics counsel in addressing matters involving former clients” if confirmed, the Commerce Department said in its statement. Elon Musk, who spent more than $250 million to help elect Trump, owns a controlling interest in SpaceX and its satellite subsidiary Starlink. Both are regulated by the NOAA’s Office of Space Commerce, which lost about one-third of its staff in layoffs by the Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk created. SpaceX stands to gain through a new generation of private and federally funded weather satellites that would be carried into orbit on its rockets. Though Musk departed Washington after a very public falling out with Trump, the DOGE staffers he hired and the cuts he pushed have largely remained in place. Requests for comment sent to representatives for Musk received no response. Lutnick resigned as CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald upon taking office and began the task of divesting his interests. His two 20-something sons took the reins of his financial empire. But Lutnick's most recent ethics filing stated he was still selling his holdings in the firm. An ethics plan from February states Lutnick would request a waiver allowing him to participate in matters with a “direct and predictable effect” on his family’s business. Securities and Exchange Commission filings, meanwhile, show Lutnick is keeping his stake in Cantor close, transferring them to a son. Cantor spokesperson Erica Chase said Lutnick has had no involvement in running the company since his resignation. “Cantor and its subsidiaries operate in heavily regulated industries, and maintain robust compliance programs to ensure compliance with all applicable laws,” Chase said. Federal officials are barred from making decisions that benefit the business holdings of themselves or their spouses, but that prohibition doesn't extend to their adult children, said Richard Painter, an ethics lawyer in Republican President George W. Bush's administration. Cantor has interests in weather and climate. It owns a controlling interest in BGC Group, which operates a weather derivatives marketplace that essentially allows investors to bet on climate risk and where hurricanes will make landfall. Lutnick also played a pivotal role in cultivating the satellite company Satellogic, which he helped take public and where he held a board seat. Cantor holds a roughly 13% stake in Satellogic, an emerging federal contractor that offers crisp images of natural disasters and weather events in real time. The White House’s 2026 spending plan proposes $8 billion in cuts for future NOAA satellites, which capture imagery of the planet provided to the public. Satellogic stands to benefit if the government retreats from operating climate-monitoring satellites. Jacobs, Trump’s pick to lead the NOAA, was scheduled to appear Wednesday before a Senate committee weighing his nomination. Jacobs has long advocated for a greater role for the private sector in government weather forecasting. During a 2023 congressional hearing focused on the future of the NOAA, he expressed concerns about what happens to commercial data purchased by the government. ""They give it away to the rest of the planet for free,” he testified. He was a consultant at the time for Spire Global and Lynker, both of which have millions of dollars in weather data contracts with the NOAA, records show. Jordan, Trump’s pick for another top NOAA post, has similarly close relationships. His financial disclosure lists more than a dozen weather-related lobbying clients, including Spire, Lynker and AccuWeather. Though his nomination is pending, records show he still represents weather companies and works at a Washington lobbying firm. ___ Contact the AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/.","Project 2025, a proposed blueprint for Trump’s second presidency that was co-authored by his budget director, calls for the NOAA to be broken up and for the weather service to “fully commercialize its forecasting operations.” Lutnick is not the only one Trump nominated for a key post with close relationships to companies involved in the gathering of weather data.","Project 2025, a proposed blueprint for Trump’s second presidency that was co-authored by his budget director, calls for the NOAA to be broken up and for the weather service to “fully commercialize its forecasting operations.” Lutnick is not the only one Trump nominated for a key post with close relationships to companies involved in the gathering of weather data.",SpaceX stands to gain through a new generation of private and federally funded weather satellites that would be carried into orbit on its rockets.,"Project 2025, a proposed blueprint for Trump’s second presidency that was co-authored by his budget director, calls for the NOAA to be broken up and for the weather service to “fully commercialize its forecasting operations.” Lutnick is not the only one Trump nominated for a key post with close relationships to companies involved in the gathering of weather data.",neutral,0.8944516181945801
