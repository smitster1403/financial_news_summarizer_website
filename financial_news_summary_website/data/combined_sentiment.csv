Pharma stocks fall up to 2% as Trump threatens steep tariffs on drug imports,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/pharma-stocks-fall-up-to-2-as-trump-threatens-steep-tariffs-on-drug-imports-13400856.html,"Indian pharmaceutical giants like Sun Pharma, Cipla, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, and Lupin, among others, saw steep cuts of up to 2 percent in the morning on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump said he would sharply raise tariffs on imported medicines. In an interview with CNBC, Trump said the new duties would begin at a modest rate but could increase significantly over time. “We’ll be putting an initially small tariff on pharmaceuticals, but in one year, one-and-a-half years, maximum, it’s going to go to 150 percent and then 250 percent, because we want pharmaceuticals made in our country,” he said, without disclosing the starting tariff rate. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The remarks have added to fears of rising protectionism, particularly in critical sectors like healthcare and technology. Trump also indicated that tariffs on semiconductors and chips could be unveiled “next week or so,” although he did not share specifics. The US government has long sought to shift pharmaceutical manufacturing back to domestic soil, citing both economic and national security concerns. A formal review of the pharma sector is currently underway, with industry-specific tariffs under discussion — though there’s no clear timeline for when the findings will be released. At present, trade between the US and the European Union in pharmaceuticals and semiconductors is tariff-free under a bilateral framework. Should new import duties be implemented following the investigation, they would reportedly be capped at 15 percent under the terms of that agreement. Also read: RBI keeps repo rate unchanged with an eye on Trump's tariff threats The proposed tariffs could deliver a significant setback to the pharmaceutical industry, which has cautioned that such measures may inflate drug costs, discourage investment in the US, and disrupt supply chains — potentially putting patients at risk. Many drugmakers are already grappling with the effects of Trump’s drug pricing initiatives, which they argue threaten both profitability and their ability to fund research and innovation. In a fresh move last week, Trump sent letters to 17 pharmaceutical companies, urging them to commit to lowering drug prices in the US by September 29. Among the demands: offering their full portfolio of existing medicines to every Medicaid patient at the lowest price available in any developed country. Trump’s latest comments could weigh on sentiment for Indian drugmakers, which count the US as a key export market. As investors assess the risks of a shifting trade landscape, pharma counters may remain in focus in the days ahead. At about 11 am, the Nifty Pharma index was down 1.3 percent to 21,686. Divis Labs, Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy's, Cipla, and Glenmark Pharma were the major laggards on the index.

Brokerages remain bullish on the stock, with target prices implying strong upside potential from current levels. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) on August 5 reported a net profit of Rs 3,315 crore for Q1 FY26.

""Haifa port operated unhindered throughout and reported 25% YoY growth in container volume and 38% YoY growth in other cargo volume during the quarter, leading to overall volume growth of 29% YoY.

The international brokerage noted that the firm's Q1 traffic was up 11 percent on-year, and it maintained its robust FY26 guidance. The Adani Group company implied an EBITDA growth of 14-20 percent on-year, despite a hazy global trade picture, it added. CLSA said that the firm's EBITDA margin improved on the back of price hikes, a better cargo mix and rupee depreciation. Jefferies kept a 'Buy' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,815 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 33 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage noted that the firm’s quarterly EBITDA was above estimates, while management reiterated its focus on absolute EBITDA growth.

Asian stocks cautious as US data clouds Fed path,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-cautious-as-us-data-clouds-fed-path-13398710.html,"Asian shares traded in a narrow range as weak US services data fueled uncertainty over the Federal Reserve’s policy path, while shares of chipmakers and pharmaceutical companies declined on tariff threats. Japanese shares rose while South Korean stocks dropped. The broader MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed. Asian chip-related stocks and some pharmaceutical companies fell after President Donald Trump said he will announce tariffs on the sectors “within the next week or so.” Treasuries edged lower with the yield on the 10-year gaining almost one basis point to 4.22%. Oil edged up after four consecutive days of declines while a gauge of the dollar was steady. US equity-index futures slipped. The S&P 500 was on the brink of all-time highs on Tuesday, before losing steam. The pullback in stocks highlighted investor anxiety over the Fed’s next move, with economic data complicating the central bank’s balancing act between controlling inflation and sustaining growth. Stocks had rallied Monday amid growing bets on potential rate cuts after weak jobs data last week. “We expect further choppy trading to persist in the later stages of summer, especially as the path of interest-rate policy remains unknown and highly sensitive to incoming economic data,” said Chris Senyek at Wolfe Research. The US services sector effectively stagnated in July as firms — faced with tepid demand and rising costs — reduced headcount. The data, released Tuesday, painted a picture of a sluggish service economy wrestling with the fallout of higher tariffs, cautious consumers and uncertainty stemming from Trump’s policies. Data out last week showed weaker-than-expected jobs data while inflation-adjusted consumer spending barely rose. “Traders are continuing to speculate on the time of the Fed’s next rate cuts with sticky inflation signs weighed against weakening economic indicators,” said Fawad Razaqzada at City Index and Forex.com. He also noted the S&P 500 outlook could start to deteriorate in the near-term amid warnings over sky-high valuations against a backdrop of weakening economy. Asian chip-related stocks declined after a stream of negative news, including a Taiwanese probe into an alleged theft of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s trade secrets. Shares of the chipmaker fell 1.7% Wednesday. Also, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. warned that its access to the crucial China market remains uncertain. Super Micro Computer Inc. tumbled after its results missed expectations. In other tariff news, Trump said he was “getting very close to a deal” with Beijing. Trump also suggested he would impose increased tariffs on additional countries buying energy from Russia — including China — after saying earlier Tuesday that he would raise levies on Indian exports within 24 hours. India is racing to contain the economic fallout from Trump’s threatened tariffs, which has left officials in New Delhi feeling shocked, jilted and unsure of how to respond. Indian shares and the currency fell Tuesday ahead of the central bank’s rate decision later Wednesday. In other tariff news, Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter arrived in Washington to make a last-minute bid for a deal to lower the 39% tariff imposed last week. The trip is to “facilitate meetings with the US authorities at short notice and hold talks,” the government said in a statement.","Asian shares traded in a narrow range as weak US services data fueled uncertainty over the Federal Reserve’s policy path, while shares of chipmakers and pharmaceutical companies declined on tariff threats.",Asian chip-related stocks and some pharmaceutical companies fell after President Donald Trump said he will announce tariffs on the sectors “within the next week or so.” Treasuries edged lower with the yield on the 10-year gaining almost one basis point to 4.22%.,The US services sector effectively stagnated in July as firms — faced with tepid demand and rising costs — reduced headcount.,Asian chip-related stocks and some pharmaceutical companies fell after President Donald Trump said he will announce tariffs on the sectors “within the next week or so.” Treasuries edged lower with the yield on the 10-year gaining almost one basis point to 4.22%.,negative,0.9649599194526672

Interestingly, there were five companies in the top 10 list — in terms of the biggest jump in retail holding — with a market capitalisation of less than Rs 300 crore. This, even as some of the companies saw the stock price plunge during the quarter. As per data from primeinfobase.com, the share of stake held by retail investors in companies listed on NSE went up to 7.53 percent as on June 30 from 7.51 percent as on March 31. In value terms, retail holding stood at Rs 34.25 lakh crore on June 30. More importantly however, the companies that saw the highest jump in the stake held by retail investors during the June quarter were all from the mid/small-cap universe. For instance, Shanti Overseas (India) saw the highest jump in retail holding – 69.83 percent as on June 30 from 26.52 percent as on March 31. The company that migrated from the SME segment to the main board in 2021 has a market capitalisation of only Rs 12.65 crore. Wendt (India), which has a market capitalisation of Rs 1,972 crore, saw the retail holding move from 16.14 percent in the March quarter to 37.32 percent as on June 30.

Incidentally, a majority of these companies saw their share price plunge in the June quarter with some shedding more than 20 percent as well. The worst performer was Protean eGov Technologies with a fall of 34.51 percent. Balaxi Pharmaceuticals and One Mobikwik Systems also saw their share prices decline 21.75 percent and 19.32 percent, respectively. On the other hand, Oriental Trimex saw a nearly 54 percent jump in the stock price during the June quarter with Shanti Overseas (India) and Wendt (India) also posting single-digit gains during the quarter.","Some of the other companies that saw the largest jump in retail holding during the June quarter were Hilton Metal Forging (mcap of Rs 134 crore), M M Forgings (Rs 1,642 crore), Oriental Trimex (Rs 69 crore), Hi-Tech Pipes (Rs 1,808 crore), Protean eGov Technologies (Rs 3,093 crore), Capital Trust (Rs 136 crore), One Mobikwik Systems (Rs 1,864 crore) and Balaxi Pharmaceuticals (Rs 265 crore).","Some of the other companies that saw the largest jump in retail holding during the June quarter were Hilton Metal Forging (mcap of Rs 134 crore), M M Forgings (Rs 1,642 crore), Oriental Trimex (Rs 69 crore), Hi-Tech Pipes (Rs 1,808 crore), Protean eGov Technologies (Rs 3,093 crore), Capital Trust (Rs 136 crore), One Mobikwik Systems (Rs 1,864 crore) and Balaxi Pharmaceuticals (Rs 265 crore).","Incidentally, a majority of these companies saw their share price plunge in the June quarter with some shedding more than 20 percent as well.","Some of the other companies that saw the largest jump in retail holding during the June quarter were Hilton Metal Forging (mcap of Rs 134 crore), M M Forgings (Rs 1,642 crore), Oriental Trimex (Rs 69 crore), Hi-Tech Pipes (Rs 1,808 crore), Protean eGov Technologies (Rs 3,093 crore), Capital Trust (Rs 136 crore), One Mobikwik Systems (Rs 1,864 crore) and Balaxi Pharmaceuticals (Rs 265 crore).",positive,0.5593519806861877
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Bank of Baroda, BLS International, Godawari Power, ICICI Prudential, BHEL, DMart and others on August 6?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-bank-of-baroda-bls-international-godawari-power-icici-prudential-bhel-dmart-and-others-on-august-6-13398367.html,"Equity benchmarks corrected after a day of rally, with the Nifty 50 declining by a third of a percent on August 5, as the market breadth was skewed in favour of bears. About 1,608 shares were under pressure compared to 1,069 shares that advanced on the NSE. The consolidation with a negative bias is expected to persist in the upcoming sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities Bank of Baroda | CMP: Rs 240.65 After a decline from higher levels, Bank of Baroda has rebounded from its support zone on the daily charts. Moreover, there was a sloping trendline breakout along with decent volume activity. The stock is witnessing a steady recovery from lower levels. The upward movement in the stock suggests a new leg of the bullish trend in the near term. As long as the stock is trading above Rs 230, the bullish momentum is likely to continue. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 260 Stop-Loss: Rs 230 ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 614.75 On the daily timeframe, ICICI Prudential Life had been in a downtrend. It is now in oversold territory and within its demand area. The texture of the chart formation and technical indicators such as the RSI indicate that the stock is very likely to rebound for a new leg of the uptrend from its demand zone. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 590 could be the trend-deciding level for the bulls. If the stock sustains above this level, we can expect a further uptrend towards Rs 660. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 660 Stop-Loss: Rs 590 Tata Consumer Products | CMP: Rs 1,064.8 After the remarkable uptrend of the last few weeks, Tata Consumer Products witnessed a short-term correction from higher levels. However, on the weekly charts, the stock is near an important retracement zone. The chart formation suggests a revival of the uptrend from the current levels. For traders, Rs 1,020 would be the key support level to watch. Above this level, the uptrend could continue towards Rs 1,140. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,140 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,020 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors BLS International Services | CMP: Rs 399.55 On the daily timeframe, BLS International Services has been consolidating in a range between Rs 351–392 since June 2025. In the previous session, the stock managed to break out of the upper end of the range, closing near Rs 399. Over the past six trading sessions, the stock has held above the previous candle’s low on a closing basis, which is a positive sign. After the sharp rise, buying on dips appears to be a wiser strategy for riding the ongoing trend with better risk management. After the breakout, we can expect good momentum on the upside in the upcoming sessions. One can use dips as a buying opportunity. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 420, Rs 438 Stop-Loss: Rs 385 Hero MotoCorp | CMP: 4,546.8 On the daily chart, Hero MotoCorp has been trading within a broader range of Rs 4,150 to Rs 4,490 since May 2025. Since the start of this week, the auto sector has outperformed other sectors, with Hero MotoCorp emerging as one of its key contributors, which is a strong bullish sign. The stock has already broken out of the mentioned range, which is again a positive sign. Moreover, Bollinger Bands have started to expand, indicating increased volatility, with prices closing above the upper bands, which can further boost positive momentum in the stock. Along with this, the MACD has just witnessed a bullish crossover, providing double confirmation for our stance. The current trend for Hero MotoCorp has shifted in favour of the bulls. One should use dips as a buying opportunity. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,700, Rs 4815 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,330 Godawari Power and Ispat | CMP: Rs 200 In the previous session, despite major indices falling, Godawari Power and Ispat managed to gain 1.8%, indicating that bulls are getting active in the stock. Prices have been respecting their upward-sloping trendline since March 2025. Additionally, the stock has managed to retrace 50% of its fall that began in December 2024. With follow-up buying, prices may retrace up to 61.8% of the fall, which comes near Rs 212, coinciding with its previous swing highs. The current trend for GPIL favours the bulls. A break above Rs 202 could further accelerate positive momentum towards Rs 212, followed by Rs 225.

On the daily chart as well, the index is comfortably placed below the 50EMA. The current range is 24,400–24,850, and in the short term, the index is likely to remain within this band. Only a decisive move beyond this range might determine the next course of action for the market. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets reversed Monday’s gains and lost nearly half a percent, continuing the prevailing corrective trend. After an initial downtick, the Nifty moved in a narrow range and finally settled at 24,649.55 level. Most sectors ended in the red, with pharma, FMCG, and realty among the top losers. The broader indices also witnessed a decline, shedding between 0.21% and 0.43%. Lingering uncertainty over the tariff situation, following recent statements from the US President, along with a lack of major positive surprises from the earnings season, has been weighing on market sentiment. All eyes are now on the outcome of the upcoming MPC meeting. While the committee is expected to hold rates steady amid global uncertainties, the tone of their commentary will be crucial. Amid this corrective phase, select stocks across sectors are showing noticeable strength and offering buying opportunities.

This follows last week’s threat of a 25 percent tariff and an unspecified penalty. In today's session, all sectoral indices traded in the red, barring auto. The broader market also edged lower by up to 0.8 percent on August 5. At close, the Sensex was down 308.47 points or 0.38 percent at 80,710.25, and the Nifty was down 73.20 points or 0.30 percent at 24,649.55. About 1708 shares advanced, 2184 shares declined, and 143 shares were unchanged. Experts say President Trump's latest tweet warning of a substantial hike in US tariffs on India over its Russian oil imports poses a serious risk. If implemented, it could further strain US-India relations and hit Indian exports to the US harder than previously anticipated. Such a move would also weigh on India's FY26 GDP growth and corporate earnings. ""As a result, the market enters a phase of near-term uncertainty. Any escalation in tariffs could trigger a negative reaction, with the Nifty potentially breaching the key support level of 24,500,"" V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Investments Limited said.

With underlying prices remaining largely stable and reduced competitive intensity hinting at further uptick, we continue to repose faith in SRCM and broadly maintain our earnings estimates.

In Q1 FY26, the turbine maker’s consolidated revenue dropped 20 percent year-on-year to Rs 371.3 crore, down from Rs 463.3 crore in the same period last year. Both key business segments struggled—domestic revenue fell 24 percent to Rs 188.2 crore, while exports slipped 15 percent to Rs 183.1 crore. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Despite pressure on the top line, other income rose 14 percent year-on-year to Rs 22.2 crore. Gross margin improved slightly to 52.17 percent, up 32 basis points from a year ago. However, operating performance remained under strain—EBITDA declined 23 percent to Rs 73.6 crore, with margins narrowing to 19.8 percent, down 81 basis points. Net profit also shrank 20 percent year-on-year to Rs 64.4 crore. The management attributed the weak quarter to geopolitical uncertainties, which disrupted operations by delaying inspections and pushing order dispatches into later quarters. Export-linked demand also remained subdued, both for equipment and aftermarket services. A high base from last year—boosted by large export orders—further skewed the year-on-year comparison. Calling it a ""challenging quarter,"" Chairman and MD Dhruv Sawhney acknowledged the results fell short of expectations but said the company is actively working to recalibrate operations. He remained optimistic about Triveni's long-term growth path, despite near-term headwinds. At about 12:50 pm, shares of the company were trading at Rs 551, lower by 7 percent from the last close on the NSE. Triveni Turbine shares are down 26 percent since the beginning of the year.

""Markets, which continue to trade at elevated valuations, have yet to price in this potential downside. India’s firm response—that targeting it is ""unjustified and unreasonable""—signals a clear intent not to make undue concessions. As a result, the market enters a phase of near-term uncertainty.

Outlook Valuation remains attractive at 0.8x; we keep multiple at 1.0x on FY27 ABV and maintain TP at Rs725. Retain ‘BUY’.

The earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) reduced 17.4 percent to Rs 206 crore in Q1FY26 from Rs 251 crore year-on-year (YoY), while the margin was reported at 24.1 percent from 28.1 percent YoY.

This implies an upside potential of 28 percent from the last close. The company’s Q1FY26 EBITDA margin came in slightly below expectations, impacted by negative operating leverage and an unfavourable product mix. Revenues declined 5 percent year-on-year, mainly due to a 25 percent drop in Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) revenue, led by a change in supply terms with a European EV client and lower volumes from a key EV customer. Additionally, supply constraints in rare-earth magnets affected traction motor production. The brokerage also flagged concerns around tariff-related uncertainties from the US. Jefferies has a Buy rating on Sona BLW but has reduced its target price to Rs 515 per share. The company posted a weak Q1, with EBITDA down 19 percent year-on-year—largely in line with estimates—due to volume drops at a key OEM, rare-earth magnet shortages, and tariff-induced demand softness. While near-term earnings visibility remains limited, Jefferies pointed out that entry into China, benefits from the railway business acquisition, and alternate motor designs to mitigate rare-earth dependency could provide some cushion. It has cut FY26–28 EPS estimates by 13–19 percent.

On Monday, Trump warned of a “substantial” hike in duties on Indian exports, citing continued purchases of Russian oil. IndusInd Bank grabbed headlines, rising over 5 percent despite overall weakness. The broader market witnessed steeper cuts and edged lower by up to 0.7 percent. At about 10 am, the Sensex was down 435.93 points or 0.54 percent at 80,582.79, and the Nifty was down 123.75 points or 0.50 percent at 24,599.00. About 1477 shares advanced, 1672 shares declined, and 145 shares were unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Experts say that in the near term, the market remains in uncharted territory, with clarity likely to emerge only after the next round of US-India trade negotiations. A trade deal that caps tariffs at 20 percent or lower would be seen as a positive trigger. However, if the 25 percent tariff stays, markets could face further downside, as such a move may weigh on India’s growth prospects and corporate earnings, making current high valuations harder to justify. As markets continue to trade, sectoral indices are showing a mixed trend. The India VIX is up 1.5 percent at 12.15, indicating a slight uptick in market volatility. Among the gainers, Nifty Energy is up 0.21 percent, PSU Bank has added 0.13 percent, and Realty is marginally higher by 0.12 percent. On the flip side, Nifty Oil & Gas is the biggest laggard, down 1.29 percent, followed by Nifty IT, which has slipped 0.93 percent. The Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 are down 0.70 percent and 0.38 percent, respectively, reflecting broader market weakness. Other key sectors like Auto, Bank, FMCG, Infra, and Pharma are also trading in the red, albeit with modest losses. Among individual stocks, IndusInd Bank shares were in focus, rising by over 5 percent after the Reserve Bank of India approved the appointment of Rajiv Anand as the new managing director and CEO. Domestic brokerage Emkay Global noted, ""We believe Anand brings on board an extensive experience across wholesale/retail banking, digital transformation, and capital markets, having worked across global financial institutions."" Shares of FMCG major Marico slipped over a percent on August 5 after the company reported an 8.2 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 513 crore for the April–June quarter of FY26. The FMCG major’s revenue from operations rose 23.3 percent to Rs 3,259 crore, driven by broad-based growth across its product portfolio. Shares of Sona BLW Precision Forgings gained over 2 percent after the company reported a 12.2 percent decline in net profit to Rs 124.7 crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal year. The company reported that its total revenue from operations reduced 4.2 percent at Rs 854 crore. After the earnings, CLSA has retained an outperform rating on Sona BLW with a target price of Rs 566 per share. This implies an upside potential of 28 percent from the last close. Technical View An inside bar candle pattern suggests that bulls are actively defending key support levels. The 24,600–24,500 zone has consistently acted as a strong floor since May, holding firm through several pullbacks. As long as this support remains intact, bulls are likely to attempt a rebound. However, the market remains under pressure, with resistance expected to cap upside moves. In the short term, the 24,850–24,950 range poses immediate resistance. With this setup, Nifty is expected to trade within a range, making a buy-on-dips and sell-on-rise strategy appropriate—accumulate near support and consider booking profits around resistance. IndusInd Bank, UltraTech Cement, Grasim, Axis Bank, and Maruti Suzuki were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the Nifty included Bharat Electronics, Infosys, Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, and Tata Consumer Products.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Sensex, Nifty set for muted open; key levels to track on August 5",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-set-for-muted-open-key-levels-to-track-on-august-5-13389415.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex are set for a muted start on August 5, after fresh tariff threats by U.S. President Donald Trump. On Monday, Trump warned of a “substantial” hike in duties on Indian exports, citing continued purchases of Russian oil. This follows last week’s threat of a 25 percent tariff and an unspecified penalty. As of 8 am, GIFT Nifty was quoting at 24,767, down 0.1 percent, hinting at a soft open for domestic equities. Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty snapped their two-day losing streak and ended on a positive note on August 4. Broader markets also supported the rebound, with both mid and smallcap indices surging over a percent each. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) were net sellers to the tune of Rs 2,566 crore worth of shares in Indian equities, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) net bought Rs 4,386 crore worth of shares. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session An inside bar candle pattern suggests that bulls are actively defending key support levels. The 24,600–24,500 zone has consistently acted as a strong floor since May, holding firm through several pullbacks. As long as this support remains intact, bulls are likely to attempt a rebound. However, the market remains under pressure, with resistance expected to cap upside moves. In the short term, the 24,850–24,950 range poses immediate resistance. With this setup, Nifty is expected to trade within a range, making a buy-on-dips and sell-on-rise strategy appropriate—accumulate near support and consider booking profits around resistance. ""Bank Nifty eked out a modest gain after a whipsaw session, yet it remains trapped in a falling channel, marking successive lower lows on the daily chart. The index is now perched just above its critical support zone of 55,500–55,000. While it stays below 56,500, the near-term bias favours the bears, and any uptick is likely to meet selling pressure,"" Shitij Gandhi, senior research analyst at SMC Global Securities, said. The India VIX remained nearly flat at 11.96, indicating indecisiveness but continued caution in the market. However, experts say that despite the prevailing weak sentiment, volatility remains below the psychological mark of 13, suggesting that the likelihood of any erratic selling is minimal. The Nifty Put-Call ratio (PCR), which indicates the mood of the market, jumped to 0.94 on August 4, compared to 0.75 in the previous session. The increasing PCR, or being higher than 0.7 or surpassing 1, means traders are selling more Put options than Call options, which generally indicates the firming up of a bullish sentiment in the market.

Track the latest updates on GIFT Nifty right here on Moneycontrol. Indian indices started the week on a positive note, snaping two-day losing streak with Nifty above 24,700 amid buying across the sectors. At close, the Sensex was up 418.81 points or 0.52 percent at 81,018.72, and the Nifty was up 157.40 points or 0.64 percent at 24,722.75. Amid weak global markets, the domestic indices witnessed a volatility in the initial hours but traded higher for rest of the session with Nifty closing near day’s high on expectation of Fed rate cut post dismal US job reports. Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Down) The GIFT Nifty is trading lower at around 24,726, indicating a weak start for the day. Asian Equities (Gain) Asian stocks rose at the open after a wave of dip buying and optimism about interest-rate cuts helped the S&P 500 post its biggest rally since May. US Equities (Rise) All three major U.S. stock indexes scored their biggest daily percentage increases since May 27 on Monday as investors sought bargains after the previous session's selloff and ramped up bets for a September interest rate cut after Friday's weaker-than-expected jobs data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 585.06 points, or 1.34%, to 44,173.64, the S&P 500 gained 91.93 points, or 1.47%, at 6,329.94 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 403.45 points, or 1.95%, to 21,053.58. US Bond Yield (Up) The yield on 10-year Treasuries and 2-year Treasuries were trading with marginal gains at 4.19 percent and 3.68 percent in the early trade. Dollar Index (Flat) The U.S. dollar wavered on Tuesday as the rising odds of Federal Reserve rate cuts weighed on sentiment, while investors assessed the broader economic impact of U.S. tariffs unleashed last week. Asian currencies (Gain) Asian currencies were trading mostly higher with Indonesian Rupiah leading the gainers followed by Thai Baht, Philippines Peso, China Renminbi, Malaysian Ringgit. However, on year-to-date basis, except Indonesian Rupiah (down 1.6 percent), all other currencies were trading with a gain of between 1-9.5 percent. Crude (Flat) Oil prices were little changed on Tuesday after three days of declines on mounting oversupply concerns after OPEC+ agreed to another large output increase in September, though the potential for more Russian supply disruptions supported the market. Gold (Up) Gold held a small gain after traders became increasingly optimistic that the US Federal Reserve will cut rates at its next meeting in September. Fund Flow Action The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) continued their selling on 11th consecutive session on August 4 as they sold equities worth Rs 2566 crore. On the other hand, Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) extended their buying on 21st day as they purchased equities worth Rs 4386 crore on the same day. Hope you're all set for today's trade.

Asian stocks rise after dip-buyers fuel US rally,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-rise-after-dip-buyers-fuel-us-rally-13388381.html,"Asian stocks advanced on renewed risk appetite, as a wave of dip buying combined with growing optimism over potential interest-rate cuts encouraged investors to buy shares. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.5%, led by gains in South Korea. Oil steadied after a three-day drop as investors weighed risks to Russian supplies, with US President Donald Trump stepping up his threat to penalize India for buying Moscow’s crude. Treasuries and a gauge of the dollar were little changed while gold advanced 0.2%. On Monday, the S&P 500 posted its biggest rally since May as traders started to price in rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, following the weaker-than-expected jobs data. Equities have rebounded sharply from their April lows, driven by growing investor optimism that corporate America can absorb the impact of the recent wave of tariffs and the US economy will be able to avoid a recession. “It looks like today everyone is following the upward trend in US stocks,” said Hiroshi Namioka, chief strategist at T&D Asset Management. “It’s a bumpy road, and investors are still mindful of the possibility of a recession. But signs of growth, particularly in US tech stocks, are helping sentiment.” After the jobs data on Friday, the markets were implying a roughly 80% chance of a rate cut at the next Fed meeting. Following last night’s trade, those odds have increased to nearly 95%, wrote Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne. Tech megacaps led gains Monday, rebounding from recent selling pressure, with Nvidia Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. each surging at least 3.5%. S&P 500 earnings are crushing second-quarter expectations — up 9.1%, triple the pre-season forecast and the strongest beat rate since 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Monday’s jump in stocks prompted a comment from Trump, who said it was a “Good day in the Stock Market” and there will be many more days like this. “America is very rich again, and stronger than ever before,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Monday. Still, a chorus of stock market prognosticators at some of Wall Street’s biggest firms are warning clients to prepare for a pullback as sky-high equity valuations slam into souring economic data. On Monday, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG and Evercore ISI all cautioned that the S&P 500 Index is due for a near-term drop in the weeks and months ahead. The predictions come after a furious rally from April’s lows that propelled the gauge to levels it has never seen before. Separately, Fed San Francisco President Mary Daly said the time is nearing for rate cuts given mounting evidence that the job market is softening and there are no signs of persistent tariff-driven inflation, Reuters reported. “I was willing to wait another cycle, but I can’t wait forever,” Daly said of the Fed’s decision last week. In Asia, investors will also be focused on an auction of 10-year Japanese government bonds later Tuesday. Some market participants expect the sale to be weak following the recent decline in yields. On the tariff front, the European Union is expecting Trump to announce executive actions this week to formalize the bloc’s lower levies for cars and grant exemptions from levies for some industrial goods such as aviation parts, according to people familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, the Swiss government said it is determined to win over Washington after last week’s shock announcement of 39% levies on exports to America. “Our base case remains that US tariffs will eventually settle around 15%. While this would be the highest since the 1930s, and six times higher than when Trump returned to office, we do not expect it to cause a recession or end the equity bull market,” said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi at UBS Global Wealth Management.","Equities have rebounded sharply from their April lows, driven by growing investor optimism that corporate America can absorb the impact of the recent wave of tariffs and the US economy will be able to avoid a recession.","Equities have rebounded sharply from their April lows, driven by growing investor optimism that corporate America can absorb the impact of the recent wave of tariffs and the US economy will be able to avoid a recession.","Asian stocks advanced on renewed risk appetite, as a wave of dip buying combined with growing optimism over potential interest-rate cuts encouraged investors to buy shares.","On the tariff front, the European Union is expecting Trump to announce executive actions this week to formalize the bloc’s lower levies for cars and grant exemptions from levies for some industrial goods such as aviation parts, according to people familiar with the matter.",neutral,0.4874159097671509

A total of 1,659 shares saw buying interest compared to 1,058 shares that declined on the NSE. The market is expected to remain in consolidation mode until it gives a decisive close above short-term moving averages. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Mehul Kothari, Deputy Vice President - Technical Research, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers Kaynes Technology India | CMP: Rs 6,297 Recently, Kaynes Technology reversed after testing its trendline and successfully broke above the descending trendline with strong volume, signalling renewed buying interest. This breakout, supported by increased participation, indicates a shift in trend. From a technical standpoint, the MACD has generated a bullish crossover near the zero line, which often acts as a reliable confirmation of building momentum. This confluence of price breakout and indicator strength suggests that the stock may be entering a new upward phase. Traders should monitor follow-through price action for confirmation, as the setup points toward a potential continuation of the bullish trend in the near term. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 6,300–6,200 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,900 Stop-Loss: Rs 6,000 Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders | CMP: Rs 2,767.2 Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders has recently experienced a significant correction from its peak of Rs 3,775, resulting in a 30% decline. At the current juncture, the price has tested the 200-day exponential moving average (DEMA) and the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), as indicated in the chart. Historically, Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders has signalled a bullish reversal after testing both averages. Additionally, volume has been increasing from the recent low, observed on both daily and hourly scales. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 2,780–2,750 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,550 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Jindal Stainless | CMP: Rs 728 Jindal Stainless Futures has provided a breakout from sideways consolidation, accompanied by a decrease in open interest, indicating short covering. Since the stock was introduced in the F&O segment, it has mostly witnessed short buildup. Now, with this strong upward momentum, the stock is likely to see further short covering. On the lower side, Rs 680 is a crucial support level as there have been significant Put additions, while the Rs 770 strike has the highest Call open interest, making it a near-term resistance. The stock is trading well above its maximum pain and modified maximum pain levels of Rs 700 and Rs 725, respectively. It is also trading well above its 20-day VWAP (volume-weighted average price) level of Rs 685, providing good support in the Rs 725–680 zone. Buy Jindal Stainless Futures in the range of Rs 732–738. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 800, Rs 830 Stop-Loss: Rs 705 Hero MotoCorp | CMP: Rs 4,535.9 Hero MotoCorp has provided a breakout from a prolonged consolidation phase, with a decrease in open interest indicating short covering. The previous up move was also driven by short covering. The recent monthly sales numbers are positive, and with the price providing a breakout, one can expect a Rs 250 up move from the breakout level of Rs 4,400—targeting Rs 4,650, and potentially Rs 4,750 thereafter. On the downside, immediate support lies at Rs 4,400 on a closing basis. As long as this level holds, upward price movement can be expected. The stock is trading above its 20-day VWAP, which is approximately Rs 4,300. It is also trading well above its maximum pain and modified maximum pain levels of Rs 4,400 and Rs 4,490, respectively, which will act as support in the near term. Buy Hero MotoCorp Futures in the range of Rs 4,520–4,450. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,650, Rs 4,750 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,400 LTIMindtree | CMP: Rs 5,089 LTIMindtree Futures had fallen due to short buildup but has bounced back on account of short covering. The recent short buildup seems to have been covered, leading to consolidation. As a result, a bounce back is expected. It has taken support at the lower end of the range, making Rs 4,950 a critical support level in the near term. Although it is trading below its maximum pain and 20-day VWAP levels of Rs 5,100 and Rs 5,160, respectively, the stock is likely to witness upward momentum. The overall IT sector is oversold, and a bounce back in the Nifty could lead to a relief rally in IT stocks. Buy LTIMindtree Futures in the range of Rs 5,070–5,050. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 5,300, Rs 5,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,950 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital CCL Products | CMP: Rs 927.6 CCL Products has been forming higher bottoms on the monthly chart since 2020, highlighting a strong and sustained long-term uptrend. On the weekly timeframe, the stock bounced from its 200-week EMA in April 2025 and has maintained upward momentum. It is now consolidating near its all-time highs, showing relative strength amid broader market weakness. Technically, it continues to trade above its 12-week and 26-week EMAs, affirming the bullish structure. The MACD remains in buy mode, supporting the ongoing uptrend and signalling momentum strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,088 Stop-Loss: Rs 875 Shyam Metalics and Energy | CMP: Rs 977.65 Shyam Metalics continues to exhibit a robust long-term uptrend, consistently forming higher highs and higher lows on the monthly chart. In July 2025, the stock broke above its September 2024 swing high, marking a new all-time high and signalling accelerating momentum. On the weekly chart, it confirmed a cup-and-handle breakout last week, supported by a bullish candlestick and strong volume, reflecting solid buyer participation. The stock trades well above its 12-week, 26-week, and 50-week EMAs, reinforcing trend strength. The MACD remains in buy mode, validating sustained bullish momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,122 Stop-Loss: Rs 927 Grasim Industries | CMP: Rs 2,787.8 Grasim Industries continues to exhibit strong bullish price action across multiple timeframes. On the weekly chart, the formation of higher highs and higher lows confirms a well-established bullish structure. On the daily timeframe, the stock witnessed a bullish mean reversion from its 100-day EMA in July 2025, signalling renewed buying interest. It remains firmly positioned above its key 5-, 12-, 25-, and 50-week EMAs, underscoring sustained trend strength. Additionally, the MACD stays in positive territory, further validating the ongoing bullish momentum.

Click to View More Outlook for August 5 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets started the week on a positive note, gaining over half a percent amid mixed cues. Despite a weak handover from the U.S. markets, the Nifty opened slightly in the green and gradually moved higher throughout the session, eventually settling near the day’s high at 24,722.75. Sector-wise, most indices contributed to the rebound, with metals, realty, and auto emerging as the top gainers. The broader markets also found some relief after the recent correction, as both the midcap and smallcap indices posted gains of nearly 1.5%. A recurring pattern observed in recent weeks is that the benchmark tends to trade with a positive bias during the first half of the week, only to witness renewed selling pressure in the latter half. Hence, participants should avoid reading too much into a single-day rebound or pause and instead focus on the sustainability of the move. A decisive break above 24,800 could trigger further upside toward the 25,000 marks, which acts as the next key resistance. Conversely, a close below 24,600 would indicate a resumption of the corrective phase. Despite the volatility, there continues to be no dearth of trading opportunities across sectors. Traders are advised to align their positions accordingly, with a strong emphasis on stock selection and effective trade management. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Following a positive start, the index remained in the green throughout the day. On the hourly chart, it has reclaimed the 21EMA, indicating improving sentiment. The RSI has exhibited a positive divergence again, pointing towards improving momentum. Moreover, on the daily chart, a bullish Harami pattern has formed, signaling waning bearishness that could lead to a recovery in the short term. On the higher end, it might move towards 24850/25000.

Bajaj Auto Q1 Preview: Muted domestic sales and margin pressure to cap earnings growth,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/bajaj-auto-q1-preview-muted-domestic-sales-and-margin-pressure-to-cap-earnings-growth-13381980.html,"Pune-headquartered Bajaj Auto Limited is set to release its earnings report for the first fiscal quarter of FY26 on August 6. Analysts expect a marginal pickup in revenue amid tepid domestic sales. Furthermore, margins are expected to be lower during the quarter. According to a Moneycontrol poll of eight brokerage firms, the Dominar 400 maker is anticipated to record a 3.2 percent year-on-year increase in revenue, reaching Rs 12,314 crore. Net profit is projected to rise a marginal 1.4 percent to Rs 2,019 crore from Rs 1,988 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year. Earnings estimates from analysts polled by Moneycontrol are in a narrow range, indicating that any positive or negative surprises could trigger a sharp reaction in the stock price. What factors will affect Bajaj Auto's earnings? Weak Domestic Sales: The company witnessed a less than 1 percent increase in volume growth as the company sold 11.11 lakh units during the quarter, higher by 11.02 lakh units sold in the same quarter of the previous year. EBITDA Contraction: The company's margins are expected to come under slight pressure, weighed down by rising commodity costs, adverse movement in forex-linked revenue, and the continued impact of OBD-2 emission norm-related expenses. ""EBITDA margin will decline post being stable last year, on the back of higher raw material costs and a spike in ocean freight rates,"" HDFC Securities said in a preview note. Decent Mix to Help: A better product mix, driven by higher exports, along with ongoing cost control efforts, is expected to support the company’s performance. A slight improvement in average selling prices, aided by increased two-wheeler and commercial vehicle export volumes, should also provide some cushion. What look out for in the quarterly show? Key points to watch for in the FY26 outlook include guidance on domestic and export volume expectations for the two-wheeler segment, as well as the company’s ambitions and roadmap for the electric vehicle (EV) space. Management commentary on replacement demand trends across two- and three-wheelers, the scale-up of electric three-wheelers, and the impact of EVs on segment margins will be closely tracked.

Hero MotoCorp Q1 Preview: Steep volume decline to dent revenue and profitability,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/hero-motocorp-q1-preview-steep-volume-decline-to-dent-revenue-and-profitability-13382688.html,"New Delhi-headquartered Hero MotoCorp Limited is set to release its earnings report for the first fiscal quarter of FY26 on August 6. Analysts expect a drop in revenue as domestic sales remain subdued. Margins are also expected to slip during the quarter. According to a Moneycontrol poll of eight brokerage firms, the two-wheeler major is expected to record a 3.7 percent year-on-year decline in revenue, reaching Rs 9,759 crore. Net profit is also projected to witness a downtick of 6.1 to Rs 1,054 crore from Rs 1,123 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year. Earnings estimates from analysts polled by Moneycontrol are in a narrow range, indicating that any positive or negative surprises could trigger a sharp reaction in the stock price. What factors will affect Hero MotoCorp's earnings? Domestic volumes dip: Hero MotoCorp is expected to witness an 11 percent drop in volumes in the first quarter. The two-wheeler major sold 13.67 lakh units, sharply lower from 15.35 vehicles sold in the same quarter of the previous fiscal. Margins under pressure: EBITDA margin is expected to come in at 13.9 percent, down 50 basis points year-on-year, largely due to negative operating leverage (production halt in April) being partly offset by richer product mix and cost control efforts. ""EBITDA margin will decline on the back of higher raw material,"" HDFC Securities said in a preview note. Operational Hurdles: The company encountered production challenges in April, which disrupted output and affected dispatches. Additionally, demand in the 110 cc motorcycle segment — a key volume driver — remained tepid. This double whammy of supply constraints and muted retail interest dragged down overall performance for the quarter. What to look out for in the quarterly show? Investors will look for guidance on FY26 two-wheeler volume growth across sub-segments. Commentary on replacement demand and the divergence between urban and rural demand trends will also be closely tracked. Updates on EV orderbook and ramp-up plans will be of interest, experts say. Additionally, the market will watch for details on upcoming model launches, orderbook and sales performance of high-end (HD) models. Shares of the company were trading at Rs 4,469, higher by 3.65 percent from the last close on the NSE. Hero MotoCorp shares have risen over 20 percent in the last three months.

Volumes in the Energy business, which largely comprises MMA, increased by 3% YoY and 4% QoQ; however, rising competition led to pressure on margins.

Asian shares trade mostly higher after stocks on Wall Street extend losses,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-trade-mostly-higher-after-stocks-on-wall-street-extend-losses-2025-08-05/,"TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were mostly higher in muted trading Wednesday, after discouraging signs about the U.S. economy sent Wall Street shares declining, and Investors are sifting through a slew of corporate earnings reports to assess how businesses may have been affected by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. Among Japanese companies, automakers Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. will report fiscal first quarter results this week, as will electronics and entertainment company Sony Corp. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.6% to 40,777.45. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.6% to 8,822.90. South Korea's Kospi lost 0.3% to 3,187.57. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.2% to 24,947.57, while the Shanghai Composite gained 0.3% to 3,627.54. U.S. futures were up 0.3%. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 fell 0.5% to 6,299.19, coming off a whipsaw stretch where it went from its worst day since May to its best since May. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.1% to 44,111.74, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.7% to 20,916.55. A weaker-than-expected report on activity for U.S. businesses in services industries like transportation and retail added to worries that Trump’s tariffs may be hurting the economy. But conversely such indicators raise hopes the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates. That along with a stream of stronger-than-expected profit reports from U.S. companies helped to keep losses in check. The S&P 500 remains within 1.4% of its record. The pressure is on companies to report bigger profits after the U.S. stock market surged to record after record from a low point in April. The big rally fueled criticism that the broad market had become too expensive. For stock prices to look like better bargains, companies could produce bigger profits, or interest rates could fall. The latter may happen in September, when the Fed has its next policy meeting. Expectations have built sharply for a rate cut at that meeting since a report on the U.S. job market on Friday came in much weaker than economists expected. Lower interest rates would make stocks look less expensive, while also giving the overall economy a boost. The potential downside is that they could push inflation higher. Treasury yields sank sharply after Friday’s release of the jobs report, and they haven’t recovered. The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.19% from 4.22% late Monday and from 4.39% just before the release of the jobs report. That’s a significant move for the bond market.

"As Trump cracks down on college student visas, other countries see opportunity",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/as-trump-cracks-down-on-college-student-visas-other-countries-see-opportunity-2025-08-05/,"LONDON (AP) — In China, wait times for U.S. visa interviews are so long that some students have given up. Universities in Hong Kong are fielding transfer inquiries from foreign students in the U.S., and international applications for British undergraduate programs have surged. President Donald Trump’s administration has been pressuring U.S. colleges to reduce their dependence on international enrollment while adding new layers of scrutiny for foreign students as part of its crackdown on immigration. The U.S. government has sought to deport foreign students for participating in pro-Palestinian activism. In the spring, it abruptly revoked the legal status of thousands of international students, including some whose only brush with law enforcement was a traffic ticket. After reversing course, the government paused new appointments for student visas while rolling out a process for screening applicants’ social media accounts. The U.S. remains the first choice for many international students, but institutions elsewhere are recognizing opportunity in the upheaval, and applicants are considering destinations they might have otherwise overlooked. The impact on U.S. universities — and the nation's economy — may be significant. New international enrollment in the U.S. could drop by 30% to 40% this fall, according to an analysis of visa and enrollment data by NAFSA, an agency that promotes international education. That would deprive the U.S. economy of $7 billion in spending, according to the analysis. Many international students pay full price, so their absence would also hurt college budgets. As the second most popular destination for international students, Britain is positioned to benefit.and The country's new Labour government has vowed to cut migration, and officials have imposed time limits on post-study visas allowing graduates to stay and work. But admissions consultants say the United Kingdom is still seen as the most welcoming of the traditional “big four” English-speaking destinations in higher education — the U.S., U.K., Canada and Australia. After declining last year, the number of international applications for undergraduate study in the U.K. this fall grew by 2.2%, official figures show. A record number of applications came from China, up 10% compared with the previous year. Applications from the U.S. also reached nearly 8,000 students — an increase of 14% and a 20-year high. Acceptances of international students for graduate programs in the U.K. grew an estimated 10% from last year, driven by demand for business and management courses in particular, according to data from UniQuest, which works with many British universities on admissions. Data showing the extent of any impact will not be available until fall, said Mike Henniger, CEO of Illume Student Advisory Services, a consultancy that works with colleges in the U.S., Canada and Europe. “But the American brand has taken a massive hit, and the U.K. is the one that is benefiting,"" he said. Demand from Chinese students has risen rapidly for universities places in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, said Will Kwong, managing director of AAS Education, a consultancy in Hong Kong. Many Western universities have offshore campuses there that are more affordable than going to the U.S. or U.K. “Opting for study in Asia has been a trend since the easing of COVID-19,” Kwong said. “But obviously it’s been exacerbated by the change of administration in the U.S.” Some Asian families have told him the U.S. is no longer their clear first choice because of political turbulence and visa difficulties, many are still waiting for U.S. visa interviews and will likely miss the start of the fall term, Kwong said. Chinese college student Alisa, who is studying data science, plans to attend an exchange program this fall at the University of California, Berkeley. She hopes to pursue a master's degree in the U.S. But she is also looking into other options “just so I could still go to school if the extreme scenario occurs,” said Alisa, who spoke on condition of partial anonymity out of fear of being targeted. Hong Kong will welcome any students who are denied entry to the U.S., the city's leader John Lee has said. Last year, the Chinese territory decided to allow international students to work part-time. Hong Kong University said it has received over 500 inquiries from students in the U.S. and is processing around 200 applications for transfer. At another school, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, international undergraduate applications have surged by 40% from last year, said Alison Lloyd, associate provost on institutional data and research. Countries including the United Arab Emirates have invested heavily in attracting international students by partnering with universities elsewhere to host branch campuses. These arrangements could appeal to students who fear being denied access to the U.S. Dubai, which has designs on becoming a global education hub, hosts dozens of international institutions’ satellite campuses. It saw international student numbers grow by a third in 2024-2025. Lisa Johnson, principal of Dubai's private American Academy for Girls, said her mostly Emirati student body is increasingly looking away from the U.S. for college. “Every student wants and dreams to go to Harvard,” she said. “But as college options increase in the United Arab Emirates, more and more students are staying."" Kazakhstan has similar ambitions, said Daniel Palm, who has helped U.S. universities set up campuses abroad. Illinois Tech and the University of Arizona are among colleges offering degree programs in the Central Asian country, drawing students mostly from China and Russia. “All of a sudden U.S. colleges are asking how to provide diversity, provide access,"" Palm said, ""because you have students who want to come to the U.S. and can't."" ___ Associated Press writers Kanis Leung in Hong Kong; Albee Zhang in Washington, D.C.; and Gabe Levin in Dubai contributed.","Universities in Hong Kong are fielding transfer inquiries from foreign students in the U.S., and international applications for British undergraduate programs have surged.","“But obviously it’s been exacerbated by the change of administration in the U.S.” Some Asian families have told him the U.S. is no longer their clear first choice because of political turbulence and visa difficulties, many are still waiting for U.S. visa interviews and will likely miss the start of the fall term, Kwong said.","Chinese college student Alisa, who is studying data science, plans to attend an exchange program this fall at the University of California, Berkeley.","“But obviously it’s been exacerbated by the change of administration in the U.S.” Some Asian families have told him the U.S. is no longer their clear first choice because of political turbulence and visa difficulties, many are still waiting for U.S. visa interviews and will likely miss the start of the fall term, Kwong said.",negative,0.9536083936691284
Trump's pursuit of meeting with Chinese leader reveals the complex web of US-China relations,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trumps-pursuit-of-meeting-with-chinese-leader-reveals-the-complex-web-of-us-china-relations-2025-08-05/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — China, the adversary. China, the friend? These days, maybe a bit of both. From easing export controls to reportedly blocking the Taiwanese president's plans to travel through the United States, President Donald Trump is raising eyebrows in Washington that he might offer concessions that could hurt U.S. interests in his quest to meet, and reach a deal with, the Chinese leader. There is no firm plan for Trump to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. But it's widely believed that the men must meet in person, likely in the fall, for the two governments to ink a trade deal, and some are worried that Xi is leveraging Trump's desire for more giveaways. ""The summit mismatch is real. There’s a clear gap between Trump’s eagerness for a face-to-face with Xi and Beijing’s reluctance to engage,"" said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies. There are concerns that Trump may throttle back on export controls or investment curbs to preserve summit prospects, Singleton said, warning the risk “isn't just in giving away too much” but also ""in letting Beijing set the tempo.” China-U.S. relations have pinballed often since Washington established relations with communist-led Beijing in 1979. They've hit highs and lows — the latter in the aftermath of the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square, after a 2001 incident involving a U.S. spy plane, during the COVID pandemic and right now. Both countries have struggled to understand each other, which has sometimes gotten in the way of deeper partnerships. And this time around, there's a wild card: the anything-might-happen second presidency of Trump. Efforts by a U.S. president to meet the head of the authoritarian Chinese government have often met with partisan outcries — which happened when former President Joe Biden hosted Xi in California in 2023. But Trump's case is peculiar, partly because he is willing to break with conventional political restraints to make deals and partly because his own party has grown hawkish towards China over national security. “With President Trump, everything seems to be open for negotiation, and there are few if any red lines,” said Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the global consultancy Teneo. “The hawks worry that if Trump gets into a room with Xi, he will agree to extraordinary concessions, especially if he believes that a big, beautiful deal is within reach.” While most Republican lawmakers have not voiced their concerns openly, Democrats are vocal in their opposition. ""President Trump is giving away the farm to Xi just so he can save face and reach a nonsensical trade deal with Beijing that will hurt American families economically,"" said Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. On Tuesday, Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, said the Trump administration “has not wavered — and will never waver — in safeguarding our national and economic security to put America first.” “The administration continues to have productive conversations with China to address longstanding unfair trade practices,” Desai said, adding that export controls on cutting-edge technology and many tariffs remain in place. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, after his latest round of trade negotiations with the Chinese in July, told CNBC that the team was “very careful to keep trade and national security separate.” And Secretary of State Marco Rubio, appearing on Fox News Radio, said the U.S. remains “as committed as ever to our partners ... in places like Taiwan” but also spoke of the strategic need to keep trade ties with China steady. “In the end, we have two big, the two largest economies in the world,” Rubio said. “An all-out trade conflict between the U.S. and China, I think the U.S. would benefit from it in some ways, but the world would be hurt by it."" Taiwan is concerned that the self-governing island could be “trade-able” when Trump seeks a deal with Beijing, said Jason Hsu, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and a former legislator in Taiwan. “Our concern is that, will any of the trade deals lead to concession on political support for Taiwan?"" Hsu said, citing the case last month where the White House allegedly blocked a request for Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te to transit through the United States. The U.S. maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and has always allowed such transits in the past. Experts are worried that the Trump administration is setting a bad precedent, and Democrats have seized on it to criticize Trump. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the House Select Committee on China, called the move “both a sharp break from precedent and another example of the Trump administration caving to China in hopes of reaching a trade deal."" He said the policy decision “sends a dangerous signal” that Taiwan’s democracy is negotiable. Hsu said Taiwan fears that Trump could be coerced or compelled to support the one-China principle, as espoused by Beijing, that acknowledges Beijing's sovereignty claim over the island. There are also concerns that Trump might utter anything in support of “unification."" That was a request Beijing raised with the Biden administration, though it failed to get a positive response. Now, it's upon Taiwan to persuade Trump to think of the island as “an economic partner rather than something that he can trade when he negotiates with China,” Hsu said, suggesting that Taiwan step up defense commitments, increase energy procurement, open its market to U.S. companies and invest more in the U.S. But Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, said Trump is bound by the Taiwan Relations Act, a domestic law that obligates the U.S. to maintain an unofficial relationship with the island and provides it with sufficient hardware to deter any invasion by China. “He can dial the (U.S.-Taiwan) relationship up and down,"" Sun said, ""but he can’t remove the relationship.” In April, the White House, citing national security, announced it would restrict sales of Nvidia’s H20 computer chips to China. The ban was lifted about three months later, when the two governments had climbed down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. The decision upset both Republican and Democratic lawmakers. Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the House Select Committee on China, wrote to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to stress that the U.S. cannot let the Chinese Communist Party “use American chips to train AI models that will power its military, censor its people, and undercut American innovation.” In Stockholm, Bessent pushed back at the concern that national security might be compromised. “We are very diligent,” Bessent said, adding there's an interagency process that involves the National Security Council and the Defense Department for decisions. “There's nothing that's being exchanged for anything,” Bessent said. Addressing H20 chips specifically, Bessent said they “are well down"" Nvidia's ""technology chips stack.” U.S. companies are banned from selling their most advanced chips to China. That might not be persuasive enough. Teneo's Wildau said China hawks are most worried that the H20 decision could be the beginning of a series of moves to roll back export controls from the Biden era, which were once considered “permanent and non-negotiable.”","“He can dial the (U.S.-Taiwan) relationship up and down,"" Sun said, ""but he can’t remove the relationship.” In April, the White House, citing national security, announced it would restrict sales of Nvidia’s H20 computer chips to China.","Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, after his latest round of trade negotiations with the Chinese in July, told CNBC that the team was “very careful to keep trade and national security separate.” And Secretary of State Marco Rubio, appearing on Fox News Radio, said the U.S. remains “as committed as ever to our partners ... in places like Taiwan” but also spoke of the strategic need to keep trade ties with China steady.","“With President Trump, everything seems to be open for negotiation, and there are few if any red lines,” said Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the global consultancy Teneo.","Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, after his latest round of trade negotiations with the Chinese in July, told CNBC that the team was “very careful to keep trade and national security separate.” And Secretary of State Marco Rubio, appearing on Fox News Radio, said the U.S. remains “as committed as ever to our partners ... in places like Taiwan” but also spoke of the strategic need to keep trade ties with China steady.",positive,0.7315357327461243
NFL and ESPN reach nonbinding agreement for sale of NFL Network and other media assets,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/nfl-and-espn-reach-nonbinding-agreement-for-sale-of-nfl-network-and-other-media-assets-2025-08-05/,"Ever since the NFL announced it was looking to sell NFL Network and other media assets, ESPN had been seen as one of the favorites to make a deal. Nearly five years later, a framework is finally in place. The NFL announced Tuesday night that it has entered into a nonbinding agreement with ESPN. Under the terms, ESPN will acquire NFL Network, NFL Fantasy and the rights to distribute the RedZone channel to cable and satellite operators and the league will get a 10% equity stake in ESPN. The league and ESPN still have to negotiate a final agreement and get approval from NFL owners. The agreement will also have to undergo regulatory approvals. “Sometimes great things take a long time to get to the point where it’s right. And we both feel that it is at this stage,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a call with The Associated Press. Along with the sale of NFL Network, the NFL and ESPN will have a second nonbinding agreement where the NFL will license to ESPN certain NFL content and other intellectual property that can be used by NFL Network and other assets that have been purchased. “We have been talking about it in earnest for the last few years. But interestingly enough, we started talking about this over a decade ago but nothing really ended up happening. And we got back at it when I came back to Disney after my retirement,” Disney CEO Bob Iger said in a call with the AP. ESPN is expected to launch its direct-to-consumer service before the end of September. The service would give cord-cutters access to all ESPN programs and networks for $29.99 per month. The addition of more NFL programming increases the value. Many viewers will receive the service for free as part of their subscription to cable, satellite and most streaming services. “When I came back to Disney and assessed essentially the future of ESPN, it became clear that ESPN had to launch a bigger and more robust and digital or direct-to-consumer product, not only for the sake of ESPN’s business, but for the sports fan,” Iger said. “And obviously, when you start thinking about high-quality sports content, your eyes immediately head in the direction of the NFL because there’s really nothing more valuable and more popular than that.” NFL Network — which has nearly 50 million subscribers — would be owned and operated by ESPN and would be included in ESPN's direct-to-consumer product. The NFL RedZone channel would be distributed by ESPN to cable and satellite operators. However, the NFL will continue to own, operate and produce the channel as well as retain the rights to distribute the channel digitally. ESPN would also get rights to the RedZone brand, meaning RedZone channels for college football and basketball or other sports could be coming in the future. NFL Fantasy Football would merge with ESPN Fantasy Football, giving ESPN the official fantasy football game of the league. NFL Network will still air seven games per season. Four of ESPN's games, including some that are in overlapping windows on Monday nights, would move to NFL Network. ESPN will license three additional games that will be carried on NFL Network. The league gets a 10% equity stake in ESPN. Aidan O'Connor, a senior vice president at the Prosek Partners marketing firm, estimates the value of that would be $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion. ESPN is currently 80% owned by ABC Inc. as an indirect subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company. The other 20% is owned by Hearst. Once the deal is official and approved, the breakdown of ESPN will be 72% ABC Inc., 18% Hearst and 10% NFL. This isn't the first time the league has had an equity stake in a digital or communications business. It had that in the past with Sirius Satellite Radio and SportsLine. The NFL could also have equity in the newly formed “Paramount Skydance Corporation,” which owns CBS, due to the league's partnership with Skydance. “This is new as far as a partner now operating a business that we built, ran and grew,"" said Hans Schroeder, the NFL’s executive vice president of media distribution. ""It’ll also be a little bit new again with some of the dynamics here, but we’ll continue to balance that in a really arm’s length way where we’ll think about how we manage and work across to all our partners.” The league will continue to own and operate NFL Films, NFL+, NFL.com, the official websites of the 32 teams, the NFL Podcast Network and the NFL FAST Channel (a free ad-supported streaming channel). “The moves align with the NFL’s longstanding ambition to reach $25 billion in annual revenue by 2027 — a target first set in 2010, when league revenue stood at approximately $8.5 billion,” O’Connor said. “Financially, the move also signals to investors that ESPN is doubling down on differentiation and content stickiness by offering a scarce and premium product in a crowded marketplace. Intentionally ceding equity to the NFL transforms ESPN from a media licensee into a true platform partner — with few properties rivaling the league in terms of cultural significance, appointment viewing, audience reach, and monetization efficiency."" Viewers will likely not see any immediate impacts until next year once everything is approved. Besides ESPN, the biggest winner in this could be NFL Network, which had seen reductions in original programming the past couple years. “Total Access,” the network's flagship show since its launch in 2003, ended in May 2024 amid a series of layoffs and cost-cutting moves. “Good Morning Football” also moved from New York, where it had been since its start in 2016, to Southern California last year. NFL Network moved to a broadcast facility across the street from SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, in 2021. “The thing that’s exciting for us is that we have put a lot into the network. I think it’s been very effective for fans. We know it’s in good hands,” Goodell said. “They’re innovative, they recognize great production and know how to produce it. They will do a fantastic job of operating the network and taking it to another level.” ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl","Under the terms, ESPN will acquire NFL Network, NFL Fantasy and the rights to distribute the RedZone channel to cable and satellite operators and the league will get a 10% equity stake in ESPN.","""It’ll also be a little bit new again with some of the dynamics here, but we’ll continue to balance that in a really arm’s length way where we’ll think about how we manage and work across to all our partners.” The league will continue to own and operate NFL Films, NFL+, NFL.com, the official websites of the 32 teams, the NFL Podcast Network and the NFL FAST Channel (a free ad-supported streaming channel).","And we both feel that it is at this stage,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a call with The Associated Press.","""It’ll also be a little bit new again with some of the dynamics here, but we’ll continue to balance that in a really arm’s length way where we’ll think about how we manage and work across to all our partners.” The league will continue to own and operate NFL Films, NFL+, NFL.com, the official websites of the 32 teams, the NFL Podcast Network and the NFL FAST Channel (a free ad-supported streaming channel).",neutral,0.9020796418190002
Mexican investigators suspect organized crime in killing of a top federal official,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/mexican-investigators-suspect-organized-crime-in-killing-of-a-top-federal-official-2025-08-05/,"CIUDAD VICTORIA, Mexico (AP) — Mexican investigators on Tuesday pointed to organized crime in the killing of a top federal official in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas the previous day, saying it was likely retaliation for the authorities' recent seizures of stolen fuel there. On Monday, gunmen killed Attorney General’s Office Tamaulipas state delegate Ernesto Vásquez Reyna in broad daylight, in the middle of the busiest avenue of the border city of Reynosa. The Attorney General’s Office said in a statement that preliminary information suggested the killing was retaliation by a group it did not name. Images from the scene of the assassination showed a smoldering black SUV and Vásquez Reyna’s body on the pavement. Authorities did not offer details on the attack other than to say that two additional vehicles were involved, and that one of them was recovered.

The statement said more than 475,000 gallons (1.8 million liters) of gasoline were seized, along with tanker trucks, pumps and containers for storing the fuel.

Unusual Machines: A Speculation With Tailwinds to Lift Its Price,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/unusual-machines-a-speculation-with-tailwinds-to-lift-its-price/,"Unusual Machines NYSEAMERICAN: UMAC has an unusual story with its once-China-based manufacturing returning to the U.S. The critical takeaway is that this leading provider of advanced drone technology, components, and accessories is now an NDAA-compliant manufacturer that can sell to U.S. government agencies and the military. That is an important factor considering the global drone industry's reliance on China and plans for government spending in 2026. The government is increasing its budget in crucial areas, including defense and modernization, which supports this company's outlook. The U.S. drone market outlook remains strong. The market, valued at around $11 billion in 2025, is projected to grow at a steady double-digit CAGR into the next decade. This will lead to nearly a 200% increase in market size, fueled by growth across various end markets, including both commercial and government sectors. The commercial market will be dominated by media, agriculture, inspection, and delivery, a focus of Unusual Machines. The outlook for Unusual Machines is more robust. With its products supported by government spending, new approvals, an expanding product line, and accelerating use-case growth, the forecast is for hyper-growth, which is likely to be low. Currently, analysts tracked by MarketBeat predict revenue will grow by at least 100% in 2026 and maintain a nearly triple-digit growth rate for the upcoming years. Profitability is also projected and is expected to be achieved by the end of this decade. The institutional and analyst trends are not robust, with the first group owning less than 5% of the stock as of early August, and the other includes only two ratings, but they are bullish. The institutions have been buying on balance since the IPO, and the analysts rate the stock unanimously as a Buy. They see this market advancing by at least 100% from the early August support levels and may also be cautious in their forecasts. The hurdle is the short-sellers. The short-sellers focus on UMAC’s fundamentals and capital needs, capping gains in 2025. The latest data shows short-interest increasing steadily from Q1 to Q3, reaching a record high of 15% in early August. Among the reasons is the company’s decision to sell more shares. Unusual Machines sold another five million shares in July, raising nearly $50 million in capital and further diluting shareholder value. Share sales before the July announcement decreased the count by 162% at the end of the first fiscal quarter. Although there is a risk of further dilution, the balance sheet remains solid. The company’s share sales should leave it with over $50 million in cash at the end of the current quarter, enough for several years at the Q1 cash burn rate, and it has no significant debt. The total liability is roughly 0.2X the Q1 quarter-ending cash, leaving the business in a flexible financial position. Unusual Machines' stock price action suggests it is set to pop when the FQ2 earnings report is released. The market shows the influence of short-sellers, but also demonstrates strong support at the $5 level and increasing support over time. The action in early August is mixed, but it supports an uptrending market and only needs a catalyst to spark another wave of buying. The forecast for Q2 is for another significant year-over-year gain, but for business to slow compared to Q1, which is unlikely given the demand trends. The likely scenario is that Unusual Machines will reveal better-than-forecasted results and provide a favorable outlook, sparking another upswing in the share price when it does. Before you consider Unusual Machines, you'll want to hear this.",The outlook for Unusual Machines is more robust.,"The company’s share sales should leave it with over $50 million in cash at the end of the current quarter, enough for several years at the Q1 cash burn rate, and it has no significant debt.","The action in early August is mixed, but it supports an uptrending market and only needs a catalyst to spark another wave of buying.","The company’s share sales should leave it with over $50 million in cash at the end of the current quarter, enough for several years at the Q1 cash burn rate, and it has no significant debt.",positive,0.8085814714431763
Zebra Technologies: Riding the Automation Wave to Profits,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/zebra-technologies-riding-the-automation-wave-to-profits/,"Zebra Technologies' NASDAQ: ZBRA stock price advanced following the Q2 earnings release to confirm a market reversal and increase the odds it will set a fresh high soon. The company is well-positioned to benefit from automation and AI, and the results reflect it. The company’s remote and data-capture products assist front-line workers, improving efficiency and accuracy to drive revenue and profits for their users. The expansion of 5G networks and the rise of AI-powered computing align with its success, enabling improved functions and aiding the increase in demand. The analysts' activity in June and July was bullish, including numerous price target increases and several upgrades that foreshadowed the Q2 strength. The company’s results affirmed the confidence, which included $1.29 billion in revenue and $3.61 in adjusted EPS, both above the analyst forecasts. The revenue is worth a 6.2% gain compared to last year and 6.3% organically, with growth present in both operating segments. The EVM or Enterprise Visibility and Mobility segment grew by 6.5%, while AIT or Asset Intelligence Tracking grew by a slightly cooler 5.8%. The margin news is better. Tariffs impacted the company’s gross margin, but far less than anticipated, and improved adjusted operating leverage compounded the effect on the bottom line. The adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 10 basis points, a slim improvement to be sure, but sufficient to leave the adjusted EPS at $3.61 or more than 25 cents better than analysts' consensus had forecast and up 13.5% compared to last year. The critical details include the cash flow and free cash flow, which are sufficient to maintain balance sheet health while the company reinvests in growth, and the guidance. Zebra Technologies' guidance is central to the stock price advance. The company improved its outlook for the year, raising the forecasts for revenue and earnings to above the consensus reported by MarketBeat. That alone is sufficient to keep the analysts happy, and the guidance may be cautious. Not only is there a recent acquisition to aid with cost-efficiency, revenue growth, and cross-selling opportunities, but others are in the works. The company announced its intention to buy Elo Touch Solutions. Elo provides touch screens, software, and services globally and is a natural fit for Zebra’s portfolio. Zebra Technologies is primarily self-funding its acquisitions and can continue doing so. At the end of Q2, the balance sheet highlights include a slight reduction in cash and an increase in debt offset by steady assets, reduced total liability, low leverage, and a nearly 1% increase in equity. The Elo Touch solution deal is worth $1.3 billion and will be paid with cash on hand and the revolving credit facility, a debt that will be quickly repaid. Other pertinent details include the company’s ability to repurchase shares while investing in growth. The buybacks aren’t robust, but they reduce the count incrementally each quarter to provide additional leverage for shareholders. The technical action in ZBRA stock is promising. The market exhibited some volatility over the preceding 18 months but appears to have a solid bottom and is in rebound mode in early August. The Q2 results and guidance update sent the market up by more than 5%, extending the rebound with a high-conviction move that set a multi-month high. Assuming the market follows through on the signal, Zebra's stock price should advance to the $400 level by year’s end and potentially move higher in early 2026. The consensus in early August assumes the stock was fairly valued ahead of the release, but the trends are leading to the high-end range and a move above $400. Before you consider Zebra Technologies, you'll want to hear this.","The adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 10 basis points, a slim improvement to be sure, but sufficient to leave the adjusted EPS at $3.61 or more than 25 cents better than analysts' consensus had forecast and up 13.5% compared to last year.","The adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 10 basis points, a slim improvement to be sure, but sufficient to leave the adjusted EPS at $3.61 or more than 25 cents better than analysts' consensus had forecast and up 13.5% compared to last year.","Not only is there a recent acquisition to aid with cost-efficiency, revenue growth, and cross-selling opportunities, but others are in the works.","The consensus in early August assumes the stock was fairly valued ahead of the release, but the trends are leading to the high-end range and a move above $400.",positive,0.46325400471687317

Vertical Aerospace's New Deal and Earnings De-Risk Production,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/vertical-aerospaces-new-deal-and-earnings-de-risk-production/,"In the first week of August 2025, Vertical Aerospace NYSE: EVTL announced a long-term strategic partnership with Aciturri Aerostructures, a major global supplier with deep roots in the traditional aerospace sector. This news, delivered alongside a stable first-half 2025 financial report, signals a pivotal shift in the company’s evolution. In the competitive race to launch electric air taxis, demonstrating that an aircraft can fly is only the first significant hurdle. The next, arguably more complex challenge, is proving it can be manufactured reliably, affordably, and at scale. Vertical Aerospace is now offering a viable answer to that critical question for investors assessing the long-term potential of the eVTOL sector. The supply chain is as critical as the design for any company developing a new aircraft. Vertical’s agreement with Aciturri is a cornerstone of its manufacturing strategy, designed to mitigate risk and conserve capital. The partnership covers the production of the entire airframe structure. This includes the complex, high-lift wing, the fuselage where passengers will sit, and the pylons that hold the advanced electric propulsion units. By consolidating this massive portion of the supply chain with a single, highly experienced partner, Vertical streamlines its future production process. It reduces the immense execution risk of building a manufacturing operation from the ground up. The choice of partner is a key indicator of the company’s mature approach. Aciturri is a Tier 1 supplier, a term used in aerospace for primary, direct contractors to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). They are not a startup; Aciturri is a major global supplier with decades of experience building critical components for the biggest names in aviation, including Airbus OTCMKTS: EADSY, Boeing NYSE: BA, and Embraer NYSE: ERJ. This deep industry credibility ensures the VX4’s airframe will be built to the world’s most stringent aerospace standards. Furthermore, Aciturri's experience isn't limited to legacy aircraft; they have also supplied airframes for other eVTOL programs, demonstrating they can bridge the gap between traditional certification requirements and novel electric aviation technology. For investors, this move aligns perfectly with Vertical's stated asset-light business model. Rather than spending hundreds of millions of dollars on its factories and tooling, Vertical is leveraging a world-class partner's expertise and existing infrastructure. This allows the company to focus its own capital and resources on its core strengths: aircraft design, proprietary battery and software integration, and navigating the complex certification process. It is a prudent capital allocation strategy that directly addresses investor concerns about the high cost of bringing a new aircraft to market. A strong manufacturing plan requires an equally strong financial foundation and focus. Vertical Aerospace's first-half 2025 report, released on August 5, demonstrates that the company is maintaining its financial discipline while advancing its crucial technical goals. This two-pronged execution is a key sign of competent management. The company reported a strong cash position of approximately $137 million. This figure, bolstered by the successful $69 million capital raise in July, provides a financial runway extending towards the middle of 2026. This runway is a critical metric for a technology company's pre-revenue, giving investors confidence that the business is funded through its next series of important milestones. More telling for investors watching the company’s spending habits, management maintained its full-year 2025 guidance for net operating cash outflow at approximately $110 million to $125 million. Holding this guidance steady, especially after signing a major new industrial partnership, signals that there have been no unexpected cost overruns and that the company’s budget is under control. This financial discipline was achieved while the core flight program continues to accelerate. The company confirmed its piloted wingborne flight test program has moved forward significantly, with multiple flights now completed by two different test pilots in open European airspace. This shows that the momentum from the historic airport-to-airport flight in July is being actively maintained. Looking ahead, Vertical remains on track to complete the year's final and most technically challenging test phase, the full transition from vertical, helicopter-like lift to efficient, wing-borne forward flight, in the second half of 2025. This parallel progress in finance and flight testing is a key indicator of a well-run organization capable of managing multiple complex workstreams simultaneously. The Aciturri partnership is the latest pillar in a rapidly maturing business strategy. It does not exist in a vacuum but complements the company's recent operational milestones and developing commercial plans. The pieces of a larger, well-thought-out puzzle are falling into place for investors. The flight test program proves the aircraft is capable, a commercial partnership with helicopter operator Bristow establishes a ""Ready-to-Fly"" model for future customers, and the Aciturri deal now provides a credible path to large-scale manufacturing. Strategic additions to its leadership further strengthen this progress. The recent appointment of Lord Andrew Parker, the former head of Britain's MI5, to the board adds significant credibility and high-level access for Vertical's strategy of pursuing high-value defense and government contracts. This avenue, centered on the developing long-range hybrid-electric variant, represents a significant potential revenue stream beyond urban air mobility. For those following Vertical Aerospace, the investment narrative has evolved. The focus is shifting from the early-stage ""Can it fly?"" question to the more mature, business-oriented question of ""How will it be built and sold?"" By methodically signing Tier 1 partners, maintaining financial discipline, and executing on its flight test plans, the company is building a more tangible and robust case for its long-term value.

Ride the Rally: 3 Earnings Winners With More Upside Ahead,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/ride-the-rally-3-earnings-winners-with-more-upside-ahead/,"In the height of earnings season, investors typically watch many of the biggest names across industries for an essential update on how these key businesses—and the broader market—have fared. Only following major firms when it comes to earnings reports may cause an investor to miss out on potential opportunities for gains to be found in lesser-known companies as well. Three niche names, including two small-cap companies and a mid-cap firm, stand out in the second-quarter 2025 earnings season for posting strong results that have attracted informed investors to buy in. Even after these short-term rallies, analysts see the potential for more upside in the near future, meaning it may not be too late to buy in. Modine Manufacturing Co. NYSE: MOD makes a wide variety of thermal management products used in residential and commercial applications, including chillers, heaters, air handling and condensing units, and much more. The company's recent earnings report, which actually coincides with its first quarter of fiscal 2026, brought a 13-cent earnings per share beat and revenue ahead of analyst estimates as well. While Modine's traditional heating and cooling products will likely always have a market, some of its biggest business in recent months has been in the data center area. The firm also builds a line of air conditioning units, coolers, and other thermal control products specifically for data centers. This segment of Modine's business is growing at an impressive pace; the company is aiming for $2 billion in data center revenue by fiscal 2028, while its entire climate solutions segment (including data center products, among others) stood at $1.4 billion in sales for fiscal 2025. Modine is supporting this sales growth with a recently announced $100-million investment to build out manufacturing capacity. Modine has also been executing strategic acquisitions with a high degree of success. Last quarter, its purchases of Absolute Air, L.B. White, and CDI all helped to drive climate solutions revenue growth of 11% year-over-year (YOY). These and potential future acquisitions may aid Modine in achieving its lofty full-year fiscal 2026 outlook of 10-15% YOY revenue growth, recently revised up from 2-10%. MOD shares are up 28% in the last month, with about 7% in additional upside potential projected. A maker of components and systems used in industrial air quality and water treatment applications, CECO Environmental Corp. NASDAQ: CECO also wowed in its latest earnings report. The company beat analyst predictions on both top- and bottom-line performance while boosting both EPS and revenue by 35% YOY and EBITDA by 45% over the same period. CECO's strong performance is likely due to rising demand for environmental solutions and CECO's increased capacity to meet that demand, thanks to its expansion into Saudi Arabia and ongoing growth across the Middle East and Asia. Owing to its broad array of products and services, CECO has business opportunities in a number of fast-growing spaces, including power generation, semiconductor, and natural gas infrastructure. This has driven a 40% CAGR since 2021 to the company's sales opportunity pipeline, which currently sits at $5.5 billion. Backlog is also growing rapidly, having reached $688 million in the latest quarter thanks to $274 million in new bookings. That's three-quarters higher than the same figure last year. With all of this growth, it's unsurprising that CECO management raised the company's forward guidance. The company now expects $725–775 million in revenue for the full year. CECO shares are up an impressive 50.4% in the last month, but analysts see the possibility of another 9% upside. Expro Group Holdings N.V. NYSE: XPRO provides energy services including well construction, drilling, tubular running, and more. Like the firms above, Expro also topped predictions for both EPS and revenue for the latest quarter, as revenue in particular climbed 8% YOY despite unpredictability in the energy sector more broadly. Expro's advantage lies in part in its massive reach, as the company serves clients in dozens of countries throughout the world. Thus, when demand increases in a particular area, the firm is prepared to meet it quickly—this is evidenced in the latest quarter by $595 million in new awards, including major new projects in Guyana and North Africa. The firm also distinguishes itself for its cutting-edge technology, including both remote clamp insulation and a fully remote cementing system launched in recent months, among others. The company's guidance is strong, and it expects about $1.7 billion in full-year revenue and 7% free cash flow thanks to its international business. It also plans to engage in a share buyback campaign to return about $40 million to shareholders in the coming months. XPRO shares are up nearly 17% in the last month, with more than 16% in additional upside possible.

Crucial exemption allows majority of Canadian and Mexican goods to be shipped to US without tariffs,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/crucial-exemption-allows-majority-of-canadian-and-mexican-goods-to-be-shipped-to-us-without-tariffs-2025-08-05/,"TORONTO (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump raised the tariffs on Canadian goods to 35% last week, but a key exemption for Canada and Mexico shields the vast majority of goods from the punishing duties. Goods that comply with the 2020 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump negotiated during his first term are excluded from the tariffs. Here's a look at Trump's tariffs on the two countries and their exemptions: Canada’s central bank says 100% of energy exports and 95% of other exports are compliant with the trade pact, known as USMCA. The Royal Bank estimated that almost 90% of Canadian exports appear to have accessed the U.S. market duty free in April. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the commitment of the U.S. to the core of USMCA, reaffirmed again last week, means the U.S. average tariff rate on Canadian goods remains one of its lowest, and over 85% of Canada-U.S. trade continues to be tariff free. “Canada is better off than any of the trading partners right now because the Americans appear to be relying as a default on USMCA,” said Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association. “That gives them the tough tariff headline but also allows them the access to the stuff they need from us. Because of that we’re in a relative better position.” Canadian and Mexican companies can claim preferential treatment under the USMCA based on where the products are made. “The headline news is 35% tariffs but it’s somewhat targeted,” said John Manley, Canada’s former industry minister, finance minister, foreign affairs minister and deputy prime minister. Manley said Canada is doing okay despite the economic uncertainty. “There is a lot of resilience I’d say. The Canadian economy has done relatively well, better than most of us expected, and remember that there is no tariffs on any of our energy exports,"" he said. Trump said last week he would enter into a 90-day negotiating period with Mexico, also one of America's largest trading partners. The current 25% tariff rates are staying in place, down from the 30% he had threatened earlier. But that 25% only applies to the fraction of Mexico's trade with the U.S. that isn't covered by the USMCA. Shortly after speaking with Trump on Thursday, President Claudia Sheinbaum said that within the “new commercial world order,” Mexico was still the best positioned nation because of the free trade agreement. “What’s within (USMCA) has no tariff, with the exception of what we already know: autos, steel and aluminum; and what is outside the treaty has 25%,” Sheinbaum said. But Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard pointed out that under the USMCA no tariffs were paid on more than 84% of Mexico's trade with the United States. Most imports from Canada and Mexico are still protected by the USMCA, but the deal is up for review next year. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last month: “I think the president is absolutely going to renegotiate USMCA."" Preserving the free trade pact will be critical for Canada and Mexico. “It would be an incredible disruption to lose it especially if you lost it to the levels of tariffs Trump is imposing, 30%, 25% or even 20%. You can absorb a single digit tariff level across the board but you can’t adjust that kind of increase,” Manley said. More than 75% of Canada's exports go to the U.S. while more than 80% of Mexico's exports go there. Manley said that depending on how the trade war plays out the risk to the USMCA is very high. “Uncertainty in business is the enemy of decision making,"" he said. Carney said in a series of recent agreements with other countries that America is, in effect, charging for access to its economy. Manley said the investment thesis for Canada is pretty straightforward as Canada is rich in natural resources, has a skilled labor force, is open to immigration and has unfettered access to the U.S. market, the largest economy in the world. “If that latter point is no longer the case, we’ve still got all the others, but we’ve got to really redevelop the investment thesis for attracting investment to Canada,” Manley said. Trump has some sector specific tariffs, known as 232 tariffs, that are having an impact. There is a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum imports and a 25% tariff on auto imports, though there is a carve-out for Canadian and Mexican made cars. “Despite our advantages, certain major Canadian industries are being severely impacted by U.S. trade actions. These strategic sectors include autos, steel, aluminum, copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and of course, softwood lumber,” Carney said on Tuesday as he announced an aid package for the lumber industry as the U.S, ratches up duties. “It is clear we cannot count or fully rely on what has been our most valued trading relationship for our prosperity,” he added. ___ Associated Press writer Fabiola Sánchez in Mexico City contributed to this report.","Here's a look at Trump's tariffs on the two countries and their exemptions: Canada’s central bank says 100% of energy exports and 95% of other exports are compliant with the trade pact, known as USMCA.","Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the commitment of the U.S. to the core of USMCA, reaffirmed again last week, means the U.S. average tariff rate on Canadian goods remains one of its lowest, and over 85% of Canada-U.S. trade continues to be tariff free.","Trump said last week he would enter into a 90-day negotiating period with Mexico, also one of America's largest trading partners.","Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the commitment of the U.S. to the core of USMCA, reaffirmed again last week, means the U.S. average tariff rate on Canadian goods remains one of its lowest, and over 85% of Canada-U.S. trade continues to be tariff free.",negative,0.9465477466583252
"Tips to help manage your buy now, pay later loans",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/tips-to-help-manage-your-buy-now-pay-later-loans-2025-08-05/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Between rising prices and dwindling job growth, using “buy now, pay later” on everything from concert tickets to fast food deliveries is becoming increasingly appealing. But greater use could also mean greater trouble, as more people fall behind on repaying these loans. Buy now, pay later loans gained popularity during the pandemic, especially among young people. While these loans can help you make large purchases without paying interest or undergoing a hard inquiry in your credit report, they can also easily be overused. About 4 in 10 Americans under the age of 45 say they’ve used ""buy now, pay later″ services when spending on entertainment or restaurant meals, or when paying for essentials like groceries or medical care, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Buy now, pay later loans were not previously reported to the three major credit reporting bureaus. But consumers will soon see the impact of buy now, pay later loans on their FICO credit scores. Whether you’re a first-time or recurring user of buy now, pay later plans, here are some expert recommendations to use this tool responsibly. Buy now, pay later plans divide purchases in monthly installments, typically in four payments. These loans are marketed as having low or no interest. Klarna, Afterpay, PayPal and Affirm are among the most popular buy now, pay later companies. These loans should ideally be used for large purchases or necessities, said Lauren Bringle, Accredited Financial Counselor at Self Financial. Bringle recommends asking yourself these questions before purchasing: Can I survive without this purchase right now? Do I need it for work, school, or a basic household need? Buy now, pay later is best used when you have a plan for the purchase, not for impulse buys. For example, when you need to buy a computer for school or a new refrigerator for your house, recommended Tyler Horn, head of planning at Origin, a budgeting app. Before deciding to take out a buy now, pay later loan, it’s a good idea to pause and consider if it’s the best financial decision for you, recommended Erika Rasure, Chief Financial Wellness advisor for Beyond Finance. Buy now, pay later plans can be positive budgeting tools when used strategically. However, it’s essential you know your spending behaviors before using them, said Rasure. If you’re an emotional spender, it might be hard for you to moderate your use of this tool and you could end up adding to your financial stress. “Buy now, pay later can become a coping mechanism rather than a financial tool that can get you a good deal or improve your cash flow,” said Rasure. If you have other payments due, such as credit card or student loan payments, consider how a buy now, pay later loan will add to your monthly payments, recommended Sarah Rathner, Senior Writer for NerdWallet. Like credit cards, each buy now, pay later loan has terms and conditions that can vary by purchase and providers. It’s crucial that you know what you’re agreeing to before you sign up, recommended Michael Savino, Chief Lending Officer at Municipal Credit Union. “Always read the fine print. Understand fees, repayment schedules, and what happens if you miss a payment or go into default,” said Savino. In general, if you miss a buy now, pay later payment, you can face fees, interest, or the possibility of being banned from using the services in the future. You can easily run into difficulty keeping up with the cost and schedule of your repayments if you're trying to simultaneously pay off two, three or more loans, Savino said. “Juggling multiple plans creates a blind spot and overall debt load, and multiple repayment dates are hard to manage,” Savino said. ""So more loans makes it more difficult to budget.” The best approach: Stay mindful of your overall spending, and limit the number of buy now, pay later loans. Whether or not you're paying for multiple buy now, pay later purchases at once, you want to be aware of where your money is going at any given time, recommended Courtney Alev, consumer advocate at Credit Karma. “Buy now, pay later often requires automatic payments, so you want to make sure that your account is funded so that those payments are processing successfully,” recommended Jennifer Seitz, director of education at Greenlight, a financial literacy app for families. There are many ways to track your loan payments — from setting a reminder on your calendar, to creating an intricate excel spreadsheet or tracking them on an app, said Jesse Mecham, founder of the budgeting app YNAB. Finding the best method that works for you will help you stay on track and avoid late fees. For shoppers with low credit scores or no credit history, buy now, pay later loans can seem like the best, if not the only, loan option. If used moderately and responsibly, these short-term loans can be a positive lending exercise, said Savino. “It allows you to to establish a baseline (and) get access to other affordable credit options that you can leverage that will ultimately provide financial wellness,” he added. Still, NerdWallet's Rathner emphasized that shoppers using these tools always remember that buy now, pay later is a form of borrowing money. “It just kind of feels like you’re given a little extra time to pay back,"" Rathner said. ""But the reality is, if you miss payments, it can hurt your credit, much like missing payments with any other loan.” —— The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

"Trump narrows Fed chair candidates to four, excluding Treasury Secretary Bessent",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-narrows-fed-chair-candidates-to-four-excluding-treasury-secretary-bessent-2025-08-05/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he's whittled down his list of potential Federal Reserve chair candidates to four as he considers a successor to Jerome Powell — a choice that could reset the path of the U.S. economy. Asked on CNBC's “Squawk Box” for a future replacement for Powell, Trump named Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, and Kevin Warsh, a former member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. “I think Kevin and Kevin, both Kevins, are very good,” Trump said. He said two other people were also under consideration, but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is not among them. “I love Scott, but he wants to stay where he is,"" Trump said. He did not name his other two top candidates but used the opportunity to disparage Powell, whom he has dubbed “too late” in cutting interest rates. The news that Trump plans to make a decision on the Fed chair “soon” comes as the Republican president has been highly critical of Powell, whose term ends in May 2026. Trump recently floated having the Fed's board of governors take full control of the U.S. central bank from Powell, whom he has relentlessly pressured to cut short-term interest rates in ways that raise questions about whether the Fed can remain free from White House politicking. Trump has openly mused about whether to remove Powell before his tenure as chair ends, but he's held off on dismissing the Fed chair after a recent Supreme Court ruling suggested he could only do so for cause rather than out of policy disagreements. The president has put pressure on Powell by claiming he mismanaged the Fed's $2.5 billion renovation project, but he's also said that he's “highly unlikely” to fire Powell. One of the Fed's governors, Adriana Kugler, made a surprise announcement last Friday that she would be stepping away from her role. That created an opening for Trump, who called her departure “a pleasant surprise,” to name a new Fed governor. Trump told CNBC it's “a possibility” that his pick to replace Kugler could also be his choice to replace Powell. Trump told reporters that he plans to name his pick to join the Fed's board of governors soon, though he is deciding whether he’ll nominate someone to permanently join the board and possibly succeed Powell or simply serve out the remaining months of Kugler's term. “I’ll be making that decision before the end of the week,” Trump said later Tuesday when asked about his Fed governor pick. Here’s what to know about the two known candidates: Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, has been supportive of the president's agenda — from his advocacy for income tax cuts and tariffs to his support of the recent firing of BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. Hassett served in the first Trump administration as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. He has a doctoral degree in economics from the University of Pennsylvania and worked at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute before joining the Trump White House in 2017. As part of Hassett’s farewell announcement in 2019, Trump called him a “true friend” who did a “great job.” Hassett became a fellow at the Hoover Institution, which is located at Stanford University. He later returned to the administration to help deal with the pandemic. On CNBC on Monday, Hassett said “all over the U.S. government, there have been people who have been resisting Trump everywhere they can."" A former Fed governor who stepped down in 2011, Warsh is currently a fellow at the Hoover Institution. He has been supportive of cutting interest rates, a key goal of Trump’s. “The president’s right to be frustrated with Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve,” Warsh said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” last month. Warsh has been increasingly critical of Powell’s Federal Reserve and in July, on CNBC, called for sweeping changes on how the Fed conducts business as well as a new Treasury-Fed accord “like we did in 1951, after another period where we built up our nation’s debt and we were stuck with a central bank that was working at cross purposes with the Treasury.” He said the Fed’s “hesitancy to cut rates, I think, is actually quite a mark against them.” “The specter of the miss they made on inflation"" after the pandemic, he said, ""it has stuck with them. So one of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy.” “He’s very highly thought of,” Trump said in June when asked directly about Warsh. ___ Associated Press writers Josh Boak and Christopher Rugaber in Washington contributed to this report.","The news that Trump plans to make a decision on the Fed chair “soon” comes as the Republican president has been highly critical of Powell, whose term ends in May 2026.","Warsh has been increasingly critical of Powell’s Federal Reserve and in July, on CNBC, called for sweeping changes on how the Fed conducts business as well as a new Treasury-Fed accord “like we did in 1951, after another period where we built up our nation’s debt and we were stuck with a central bank that was working at cross purposes with the Treasury.” He said the Fed’s “hesitancy to cut rates, I think, is actually quite a mark against them.” “The specter of the miss they made on inflation"" after the pandemic, he said, ""it has stuck with them.","One of the Fed's governors, Adriana Kugler, made a surprise announcement last Friday that she would be stepping away from her role.","Warsh has been increasingly critical of Powell’s Federal Reserve and in July, on CNBC, called for sweeping changes on how the Fed conducts business as well as a new Treasury-Fed accord “like we did in 1951, after another period where we built up our nation’s debt and we were stuck with a central bank that was working at cross purposes with the Treasury.” He said the Fed’s “hesitancy to cut rates, I think, is actually quite a mark against them.” “The specter of the miss they made on inflation"" after the pandemic, he said, ""it has stuck with them.",neutral,0.47962692379951477
California marijuana grower said 9 employees were among hundreds detained in immigration raid,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/california-marijuana-grower-said-9-employees-were-among-hundreds-detained-in-immigration-raid-2025-08-05/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — California's biggest legal marijuana grower said nine of its employees were detained in a federal immigration raid last month that netted hundreds of arrests, and that the business has ended its relationship with two labor contractors that supplied its farmworkers. The statement came nearly a month after federal authorities raided Glass House’s farms in Camarillo and Carpinteria, northwest of Los Angeles, and arrested about 360 people. Federal officials characterized the raids as one of the largest immigration operations since President Donald Trump took office in January. In Camarillo, armored vehicles blocked the road outside while demonstrators faced off with federal agents who fired tear gas to disperse them. Inside, one farmworker fell from a greenhouse roof while running to hide from authorities and later died from his injuries. Glass House Brands said in a statement it was served a federal search warrant at its two farms for an investigation into suspected immigration violations. After the raid, federal authorities said agents found 14 immigrant children on the Camarillo property and that it was investigating potential child labor, human trafficking and other abuse. The company didn't confirm that minors were at the site and said none of the nine employees were teens. Glass House said it worked with farm labor contractors that were required to ensure workers were at least 21 years old, in line with California’s marijuana-growing regulations. “Any other individuals detained or arrested would have been either employees of third-party contractors providing services at the Company’s Camarillo farm,” Glass House said in a statement on Monday, adding that it is now working with other contractors. The company said it also hired consultants to assist with determining the employment eligibility of its employees and those of its contractors. The operation came more than a month into an extended immigration crackdown across Southern California that was originally centered in Los Angeles. Online court records don’t show any federal charges filed against Glass House. Messages seeking comment were left with the U.S. Attorney’s office in Los Angeles and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. It is legal to grow and sell cannabis in California with proper licensing. State records showed Glass House had multiple active licenses to cultivate cannabis at the time of the raids.","The statement came nearly a month after federal authorities raided Glass House’s farms in Camarillo and Carpinteria, northwest of Los Angeles, and arrested about 360 people.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — California's biggest legal marijuana grower said nine of its employees were detained in a federal immigration raid last month that netted hundreds of arrests, and that the business has ended its relationship with two labor contractors that supplied its farmworkers.",The operation came more than a month into an extended immigration crackdown across Southern California that was originally centered in Los Angeles.,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — California's biggest legal marijuana grower said nine of its employees were detained in a federal immigration raid last month that netted hundreds of arrests, and that the business has ended its relationship with two labor contractors that supplied its farmworkers.",negative,0.9466301798820496
A former Rolling Stone says the Met has his stolen guitar. The museum disputes it,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/a-former-rolling-stone-says-the-met-has-his-stolen-guitar-the-museum-disputes-it-2025-08-05/,"LONDON (AP) — It’s only rock ‘n’ roll, but it’s messy. A guitar once played by two members of the Rolling Stones is at the center of a dispute between the band’s former guitarist Mick Taylor and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The 1959 Gibson Les Paul was donated to the Met as part of what the New York museum calls “a landmark gift of more than 500 of the finest guitars from the golden age of American guitar making.” The donor is Dirk Ziff, a billionaire investor and guitar collector. When the Met announced the gift in May, Taylor thought he recognized the guitar, with its distinctive “starburst” finish, as an instrument he last saw in 1971, when the Stones were recording the album “Exile on Main St.” at Keith Richards’ rented villa in the south of France. In the haze of drugs and rock ‘n’ roll that pervaded the sessions, a number of instruments went missing, believed stolen. Now, Taylor and his team believe it has reappeared. The Met says provenance records show no evidence the guitar ever belonged to Taylor. “This guitar has a long and well-documented history of ownership,” museum spokesperson Ann Bailis said. Taylor’s partner and business manager, Marlies Damming, said the Met should make the guitar “available for inspection.” “An independent guitar expert should be able to ascertain the guitar’s provenance one way or the other,” she said in a statement Tuesday to The Associated Press. While its ownership is contested, there’s no disputing the instrument’s starring role in rock history. It was owned in the early 1960s by Keith Richards, who played it during the Rolling Stones’ first appearance on “The Ed Sullivan Show” in 1964. The Met says that performance “ignited interest in this legendary model.” The guitar – nicknamed the “Keithburst” – was also played by guitar legends Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page. Taylor says he got it from Richards in 1967, two years before he joined the Stones, replacing original member Brian Jones. Jones died in 1969. Taylor left the band in 1974, reuniting with them for the Stones' 50th anniversary tour in 2012-2013. Jeff Allen, who was Taylor’s manager and publicist for decades from the 1990s, said Taylor “told me he got it as a present from Keith,” and also mentioned the theft. “Mick did tell me that the guitar solo that he became quite famous for, on ‘Can’t You Hear Me Knocking,’ was with the Les Paul that got stolen,” Allen said. The Met’s records say the Les Paul was owned by Richards until 1971, when it was acquired by record producer and manager Adrian Miller, who died in 2006. The guitar has changed hands several times since then, and reappeared twice in public. It was put up for auction by Christie’s in 2004, when it failed to sell. Ziff bought it in 2016, and loaned it to the Met in 2019 for an exhibition titled “Play it Loud: Instruments of Rock & Roll.” It's unclear what will happen next. The Met, which plans to open a new gallery dedicated to its collection of American guitars, says it has not been contacted by Taylor or his representatives. ___ Associated Press writer Jocelyn Noveck in New York contributed to this story.","Jeff Allen, who was Taylor’s manager and publicist for decades from the 1990s, said Taylor “told me he got it as a present from Keith,” and also mentioned the theft.","The 1959 Gibson Les Paul was donated to the Met as part of what the New York museum calls “a landmark gift of more than 500 of the finest guitars from the golden age of American guitar making.” The donor is Dirk Ziff, a billionaire investor and guitar collector.","“This guitar has a long and well-documented history of ownership,” museum spokesperson Ann Bailis said.","The 1959 Gibson Les Paul was donated to the Met as part of what the New York museum calls “a landmark gift of more than 500 of the finest guitars from the golden age of American guitar making.” The donor is Dirk Ziff, a billionaire investor and guitar collector.",neutral,0.8859280347824097
A $2.5 billion pledge makes women’s health a priority in Gates Foundation spend-down,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/a-25-billion-pledge-makes-womens-health-a-priority-in-gates-foundation-spend-down-2025-08-05/,"Innovations on the horizon in women’s health show what’s possible with more investment. With the help of ultrasound equipment powered by artificial intelligence, frontline health care workers may be able to track the progress of developing embryos with a minimum of training. And birth control injections that last six months could give women more control over reproduction. Those are just two potential breakthroughs out of more than 40 the Gates Foundation intends to support through a five-year, $2.5 billion commitment on women’s health research and development, more than triple the amount it has spent on women’s health innovation over the past five years. “Many of the most pressing conditions impacting women still remain understudied, underdiagnosed, and overlooked,” said Ru-fong Joanne Cheng, director of Women’s Health Innovations at Gates. A very small share of medical research funding supports the study of health specific to women, including gynecological and menstrual health, obstetric care, contraceptive innovation, sexually transmitted infections, and maternal health and nutrition, the foundation said. It cited a 2021 McKinsey and Company study that found 1% of all medical research, setting aside cancer research, goes toward women’s health. The foundation framed the commitment as part of its May announcement that it would spend down its assets over the next 20 years and concentrate much of its support on global health. While much of the research funded over the next five years will benefit women worldwide, the foundation said, the need is most acute in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. By devoting billions to women’s health, the foundation has signaled it intends to continue to invest in the cause following the 2024 departure of Melinda French Gates, who led the foundation’s support of girls’ and women’s health. Since her divorce from Bill Gates, French Gates has committed more than $1 billion to improve women’s physical and mental health, provide more economic opportunity to women, and increase their political sway. The announcement follows a U.S. pullback of support for global maternal health programs during the first seven months of the Trump administration. The shuttering of the U.S. Agency for International Development and program reductions at the Centers for Disease Control have sunset programs focused on women’s health. According to a March internal USAID memo, the agency’s closure will stop services for 16.8 million pregnant women annually. In April, the World Health Organization said that the 40 percent decline in maternal deaths from 2000 to 2023 has been put at risk because of aid cuts. While the foundation continues to focus on the delivery of health care globally in an era of governmental retreat, the $2.5 billion will focus squarely on research needed to save lives, Anita Zaidi, president of Gates’s Gender Equality Division, said on a press call Monday to discuss the announcement. “This is an innovation-focused announcement,” she said. “We need both innovation and delivery.” It’s important to remember that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has only been required to test novel drugs on women in clinical trials since 1993, and many tests are still only done on men, said Katy Brodsky Falco, founder of the Foundation for Women’s Health, which plans to make $5 million in research grants this year. With Gates getting behind research and development of women’s health with such a large commitment, others may follow, Brodsky Falco said. “Hopefully it will bring the issue to the top of the conversation among private donors and family foundations, even if they otherwise haven’t supported this type of work,” she said. Moses Obimbo Madadi, professor at the University of Nairobi, noted that postpartum hemorrhaging causes about 3,000 deaths annually in Kenya. If men were the victims, he said, a G7 conference would be called to find a solution, but research on the subject has largely been ignored because it claims the lives of women. “We’ve treated this as a peripheral issue other than making it a centerpiece of our research,” he said, calling the Gates commitment a “very good starting point.” _____ Alex Daniels is a senior reporter at the Chronicle of Philanthropy, where you can read the full article.

Trump administration dismisses all Democrats on a federal board overseeing Puerto Rico's finances,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-trump-administration-dismisses-most-on-a-federal-board-overseeing-puerto-ricos-finances-2025-08-05/,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — The Trump administration has dismissed five out of seven members on Puerto Rico’s federal control board that oversees the U.S. territory’s finances, sparking concern about the future of the island’s fragile economy. The five fired are all Democrats. A White House official told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the board “has been run inefficiently and ineffectively by its governing members for far too long and it’s time to restore common sense leadership.” Those fired are board chairman Arthur Gonzalez, along with Cameron McKenzie, Betty Rosa, Juan Sabater and Luis Ubiñas. The board’s two remaining members — Andrew G. Biggs and John E. Nixon — are Republicans. The board confirmed in a brief statement that the five were terminated and noted that the board would continue to fulfill its mandate and work “in the interest of the people of Puerto Rico.” Sylvette Santiago, a spokesperson for the board, did not immediately return a message seeking comment on whether the board members would fight the decision. Meanwhile, Rep. Nydia Velázquez, a New York Democrat, criticized the dismissals though she acknowledged what she said were “serious and longstanding concerns” about actions the board has taken, including implementing austerity measures. “This sudden purge by Donald Trump is not about justice or reform,"" she said in a statement. ""It simply creates an opening to stack the Board with even more extreme, pro-bondholder appointees who will continue to put the needs of hedge funds over the Puerto Rican people.” The board was created in 2016 under the Obama administration, a year after Puerto Rico’s government declared it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load and later filed for the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. In remarks to the AP, the White House official claimed the board had operated ineffectively and in secret and said it “shelled out huge sums to law, consulting and lobbying firms.” The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the subject, also accused the board’s staff of receiving “exorbitant salaries.” Puerto Rico is struggling to restructure more than $9 billion in debt held by the state’s Electric Power Authority, with officials holding bitter mediations with creditors demanding full payment. It’s the only Puerto Rico government debt pending a restructuring, with the White House official accusing the board of preferring to “extend the bankruptcy.” In February, the board’s executive director, Robert Mujica Jr., said it was “impossible” for Puerto Rico to pay the $8.5 billion that bondholders are demanding. He instead unveiled a new fiscal plan that proposed a $2.6 billion payment for creditors. The plan does not call for any rate increases for an island that has one of the highest power bills in any U.S. jurisdiction as chronic power outages persist, given the grid’s weak infrastructure. Alvin Velázquez, a bankruptcy law professor at Indiana University, said he worries the dismissal of the board members could spark another crisis in Puerto Rico. “This is really about getting a deal out of (the power company) that is not sustainable for the rate payers of Puerto Rico,” he said. Velázquez, former chair for the unsecured creditors committee during the bankruptcy proceedings, also questioned if the dismissals are legal, since board members can only be removed for just cause. “What’s the cause?” he said. “What you’re going to see is another instance in which the Trump administration is taking on and testing the courts.” The dismissals were first reported by the Breitbart News Network, a conservative news site.",The explosive surge in call options is a powerful market signal that a growing number of investors are looking past Applied Digital's history and are squarely focused on its future as a key enabler of the AI industry.,The explosive surge in call options is a powerful market signal that a growing number of investors are looking past Applied Digital's history and are squarely focused on its future as a key enabler of the AI industry.,"Following its fiscal year-end earnings report, the company raised approximately $270 million in new capital, providing a significant cash buffer for construction.","The bet being made by a growing number of traders is clear: Applied Digital is poised to flip the switch, not just on its new data centers, but on a new era of predictable growth, profitability, and significant value creation for its shareholders.",neutral,0.7015398740768433
Applied Digital: Why a Surge in Bullish Bets Signals a New Era,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/applied-digital-why-a-surge-in-bullish-bets-signals-a-new-era/,"Most investors will tell you that it pays to listen when the market sends a clear signal. On August 1, 2025, the market for Applied Digital Corporation NASDAQ: APLD was practically shouting. On that day, the volume of call options traded for the company surged 220.9% over its daily average, a spike in activity that caught the attention of Wall Street. This market action points directly to a powerful story unfolding within the company: Applied Digital's fundamental transformation into an essential infrastructure provider for the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. For a growing number of investors, this is a clear sign that the company is standing at a much-anticipated turning point, and they are beginning to position themselves accordingly. The confidence displayed by options traders is rooted in Applied Digital’s successful strategic pivot away from its history of hosting for the volatile cryptocurrency mining industry. The company is aggressively remaking itself into what can best be described as an AI Landlord. Instead of speculating on technology, Applied Digital is building and leasing out the essential, high-value digital real estate required by the titans of the AI revolution. This picks and shovels business model is incredibly attractive because it offers a durable way to invest in the entire AI boom, backed by physical assets and predictable, long-term rental income, much like a commercial real estate owner with a blue-chip anchor tenant. This strategy is cemented by a landmark agreement with CoreWeave NASDAQ: CRWV, a prominent private AI Hyperscaler backed by industry leader NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA. This single partnership validates Applied Digital’s new identity and provides the hard evidence for the bullish investment case. The scale of the deal, which was recently expanded, is immense: This agreement provides an unprecedented level of revenue visibility for a company of Applied Digital’s size, transforming its financial future. For investors, this contract is the cornerstone of the bullish thesis and the primary reason traders are re-evaluating what the company is truly worth. An $11 billion contract is only valuable if a company can deliver on it. The central question for investors has now shifted from strategy to execution, and Applied Digital's management is taking clear and decisive steps to de-risk its ambitious construction plan. These actions directly address investor concerns and are aimed at ensuring the contracted revenue becomes a reality. First, the company has fortified its financial position. Building data centers is a capital-intensive business, and Applied Digital has proactively strengthened its balance sheet. Following its fiscal year-end earnings report, the company raised approximately $270 million in new capital, providing a significant cash buffer for construction. Management also stated on its July 30 earnings call that it expects to finalize the broader project financing for the campus within weeks, which would secure the long-term funding required for the entire build-out. Second, the company is accelerating its operational timeline. By streamlining its design and supply chain, management has successfully reduced projected datacenter build times from 24 months down to an impressive 12 to 14 months. This efficiency not only speeds up the timeline to revenue generation but also demonstrates a high level of operational expertise that can be a key competitive advantage. This visible progress is why the market is beginning to re-evaluate the stock’s potential. When comparing Applied Digital’s full-year 2025 revenue of $144.2 million to its now massive $11 billion revenue backlog, the step-change in the company’s financial scale becomes clear. This forward-looking sentiment is being echoed by Applied Digital’s analyst community, with several analyst firms, including Lake Street Capital and Needham & Company, significantly raising their price targets on the stock, with some targets now reaching as high as $18.00. The explosive surge in call options is a powerful market signal that a growing number of investors are looking past Applied Digital's history and are squarely focused on its future as a key enabler of the AI industry. With its foundational $11 billion contract secured and clear, tangible steps being taken to de-risk the execution phase, the company is poised to become an essential landlord to some of the most important companies in technology. The bet being made by a growing number of traders is clear: Applied Digital is poised to flip the switch, not just on its new data centers, but on a new era of predictable growth, profitability, and significant value creation for its shareholders.

NASDAQ: PLTR is up over 8% the morning after the company delivered a blowout earnings report that had shareholders cheering and, for a moment, quieted its naysayers.

The company also beat earnings expectations by three cents. Some additional highlights in the company’s report included: The bullish enthusiasm wasn’t just about the current earnings report. Chief executive officer (CEO) Alex Karp remarked that he’s committed to the company growing its revenue by 10x over the next five years. That was the message Karp shared with what he called the “Palantir haters” in an interview with CNBC. It’s easy to understand why Karp would celebrate a victory. The reasonable, but perhaps overstated, criticism of Palantir is that the stock is priced to perfection and then some. However, as the saying goes, it’s not bragging if you can do it. That’s exactly what Palantir continues to do. The report, by any objective measure, was spectacular. However, more importantly, the company’s forward guidance signals that it will continue to grow. In fact, referring to the “bombastic demand” for the company’s AI platform, Karp noted that the company is “growing faster than we are even able to grow, like we’re going to have to start turning away people...” The company isn’t turning away the federal government. In fact, Palantir announced that it has $10 billion in contracts with the government over the next 10 years. It’s common for analysts to reevaluate a company’s rating and price target after an earnings report. One of the most prominent Palantir bulls, Dan Ives of Wedbush, raised his price target on PLTR stock from $175 to $200. Investors will recall that Ives has referred to Palantir as the “Lionel Messi of AI.” Ives isn’t alone. Deutsche Bank upgraded Palantir from a Sell to a Hold while doubling its price target from $80 to $160. Cantor Fitzgerald and Piper Sandler also raised their price targets for PLTR stock. Seeing price targets move higher is encouraging. This is important for several reasons. First, it demonstrates that institutions are still buying Palantir stock, despite its high valuation. Second, it shows that retail investors continue to hold their shares, even while high. Technology stocks historically carry a premium valuation. However, Palantir is expensive by any measure, and the debate about Palantir’s valuation isn’t going to go away anytime soon. However, it’s important to note that many investors who passively add money to their 401(k) funds may already have exposure to PLTR stock. For example, PLTR stock is the 28th largest holding of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF NYSEARCA: VOO as of this writing. However, this may not provide enough exposure for growth investors, who may require a more active approach. In this case, investors with a long-term focus on the company’s valuation can scale into the stock over time.

US government proposes easing some restrictions on drones traveling long distances,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/us-government-proposes-easing-some-restrictions-on-drones-traveling-long-distances-2025-08-05/,"A new federal rule proposed Tuesday would make it easier for companies to use drones over longer distances out of the operator's sight without having to go through a cumbersome waiver process. The federal government had already approved 657 waivers to allow companies such as Amazon and major utilities to do this in certain circumstances, but the waiver process made it difficult. The rule would establish a clear process for drone operators to seek approval for using drones this way. The industry has long pressed for the rule because being able to operate drones out of sight opens up a multitude of possibilities for their use. Being able to do this enables more use of drones for deliveries, inspecting infrastructure like bridges and power lines and other uses in agriculture like spraying fertilizer over thousands of acres on large farms. “This draft rule is a critical step toward enabling drone operations that will enhance safety, transform commercial services, and strengthen public safety with drones as a force multiplier,"" Michael Robbins, president & CEO of the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International trade group, said in a statement. The rule spells out the circumstances drones can be used. These out of sight flights will only be allowed under 400 feet, and there are precautions to ensure they don't disrupt aviation and cause problems around airports, Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford said. The drones will be required to have collision-avoidance technology to keep them away from planes and other drones. And the rule will only allow drones up to 1,320 pounds — including their payloads. “The issue hasn’t been that America just can’t innovate, America can’t create, America can’t build amazing drone technology. It’s that we’ve had a bureaucracy in place that makes it incredibly incredibly difficult for innovators to actually innovate,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said. The rules are designed to address the way modern drones are being used today. “While the technology has rapidly advanced over the last decade, our regulatory framework in the United States has failed to keep pace,” said Lisa Ellman, CEO of the Commercial Drone Alliance group. “Drone operators must navigate a labyrinth of ill-suited regulations designed for crewed aircraft.” President Donald Trump issued executive orders in June directing the Transportation Department to quickly get this rule out. The orders also included restrictions meant to help protect against terrorism, espionage and public safety threats. Drones are already used in a variety of ways, including bolstering search and rescue operations, applying fertilizer, inspecting power lines and railroad bridges, and even delivering packages. Amazon is one of the companies that received a waiver allowing it to use drones this way for some of its deliveries in College Station, Texas, as it develops the technology. This rule should make it easier for Amazon and other companies to get approval to use drones this way in more communities. Flytrex, a Tel Aviv-based drone delivery company that has operations in Texas and North Carolina, said it was excited to see the proposed rule take shape. Flytrex co-founder and CEO Yariv Bash called the proposed rule “a foundational milestone that paves the way for drone delivery to scale across more communities in the U.S.” “This rule is a critical step toward unlocking the full potential of drone delivery and ensuring its long-term business viability nationwide,” Bash said. The war in Ukraine has highlighted how drones could be used in a military or terrorist attack — a concern as the World Cup and Olympics approach in the U.S. There also have been espionage cases where drones have been used to surveil sensitive sites. And White House officials said drones are being used to smuggle drugs over the border, and there are concerns about the potential for a disastrous collision between a drone and an airliner around an airport. The rule won't allow drone flights over large open-air gatherings like concerts or sporting events or crowded parks. The FAA consulted with the Department of Homeland Security as it developed this rule to make sure security concerns are addressed. The government will accept comments on the new rule over the next 60 days before finalizing the rule likely sometime later this year. Drone operators will have to go through background checks and be certified to operate drones out of their sight. Duffy and Bedford said they hope having regulations in place can help prevent problems like earlier this year when a small drone collided with a “Super Scooper” plane that was fighting wildfires raging through Southern California. The drone punched a hole in the plane’s left wing, causing enough damage that officials grounded the aircraft for several days to make repairs. Authorities tracked down the 56-year-old drone operator, who pleaded guilty to a federal charge of recklessly flying his aircraft. The man admitted he launched his DJI quadcopter to observe fire damage over the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, despite the FAA having restricted drone flying in the area, according to court records. The operator lost sight of the drone after it flew about 1.5 miles from where he had launched it. And that’s when it struck the “Super Scooper.” This rule applies directly to commercial and recreational drone operators who must apply to be able to fly drones out of sight. People who buy drones on their own and don’t get approval would still be prohibited from doing this. ___ Associated Press writers Dee-Ann Durbin, Rio Yamat and Didi Tang contributed to this report. ___ This story has been updated to correct Lisa Ellman’s first name.",WASHINGTON (AP) — Proposed rule would make it easier for companies to use drones over longer distances out of the operator's sight.,WASHINGTON (AP) — Proposed rule would make it easier for companies to use drones over longer distances out of the operator's sight.,WASHINGTON (AP) — Proposed rule would make it easier for companies to use drones over longer distances out of the operator's sight.,WASHINGTON (AP) — Proposed rule would make it easier for companies to use drones over longer distances out of the operator's sight.,neutral,0.823284924030304

Amazon Enters Correction Zone: Time to Panic or Be Brave?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/amazon-enters-correction-zone-time-to-panic-or-be-brave/,"Tech giant Amazon.com Inc NASDAQ: AMZN delivered one of its better headline beats in last week’s earnings report, yet the stock has shed 10% in just two sessions. The swift drop follows a stunning 45% rally from April’s low, a run that left little room for anything short of perfection. With the broader market refusing to be dragged down by Amazon, a rare and notable divergence, those of us on the sidelines need to ask ourselves some important questions. For example, is this simply a much-needed bout of profit-taking, or could it be the start of a much deeper shake-out? And depending on how you feel about it, is now the time to panic or the time to be brave? Let’s start with the fundamentals. There’s no escaping from the fact that Amazon’s headline results last week hardly read like a company in trouble. Revenue rose double-digits year-over-year and topped Wall Street’s forecast by a comfortable margin, while earnings per share were 25% higher than expected. There were also plenty of other bright spots under the hood, such as its much-watched AWS business, which showed encouraging signs of cloud demand continuing to grow. However, management’s cautious guidance for operating income seems to have spooked investors. The midpoint fell a shade below consensus, and after a nearly vertical four-month ascent, many of Amazon’s bulls seem to have seized the excuse to lock in some of their gains. This is even though almost all analysts covering Amazon have reiterated bullish outlooks in the aftermath of Thursday’s report. The teams over at Goldman Sachs and Cowen did just that, for example, on Friday, as did BMO Capital Markets, the latter even boosting their price target up to $280. From the $212 level, Amazon closed just below on Monday, which points to a targeted upside of some 30%; not bad for a $2.2 trillion company. The analysts are mostly united in their praise for Amazon’s steady retail profit growth, its shift toward higher-margin advertising revenue, and an increasing potential for AI-driven efficiencies. These positive factors are expected to persist for some time, and investors should capitalize on them. Technically, the stock has already met the textbook definition of a correction, sliding 10% from its recent high. The relative strength index now hovers in the mid-30s, just above the extremely oversold threshold, a territory it has not visited since early spring. Simultaneously, it’s also now trading at a decent support level around the $210 mark, an area where dip-buyers stepped in during June, adding to the sense that this could be a prime entry point. If this level were to hold through this week, we could look at a clean signal that the worst of the shake-out is done. Yet it has to be said that Amazon’s post-earnings sell-off continued yesterday even as the S&P 500 logged one of its better days in weeks, a rare divergence that hints at real money leaving the table. That absence of dip-buyers could well mean institutions want to see some consolidation before redeploying capital, and indeed, it’s hard to argue that a cooling-off period isn’t needed, even if it feels painful. The bears will also point to management’s heavier spending plans on artificial intelligence and infrastructure and ongoing concerns about Amazon’s broader vulnerability. If the macro backdrop wobbles, for example, or we see increased tariff uncertainty or a consumer soft patch, this profit-taking could quickly become more structural. However, keep in mind that Amazon’s report showed some real revenue momentum for last quarter, their margins are in good shape, and their AWS franchise remains pretty dominant among its competitors. The market’s reaction looks more like a healthy reset than a full reversal, for now at least. Whether you’re stepping aside for a clearer technical signal or are starting to build a position now, the real question is whether Amazon’s long-term growth machine has changed—for most analysts and many seasoned investors, the answer is a confident no.

Why Citigroup Analysts See Double-Digit Upside in Coinbase Stock,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-citigroup-analysts-see-double-digit-upside-in-coinbase-stock/,"Most investors would agree that today’s stock market is dominated by risk-on sentiment, with the S&P 500 reaching new all-time highs largely due to the strong performance of a few leading technology stocks. There is nothing wrong with this situation, but it does raise a few flags for active investors moving forward, flags that represent additional profit potential. Since this risk-on outlook mainly reflects the collective mindset rather than a specific quantitative measure, investors anticipate a spill-over effect from stocks to other speculative sectors. That's where Bitcoin's role becomes important as the top speculative asset in cryptocurrency, frequently hitting and maintaining near new all-time highs. However, Bitcoin's upward trend has not been without a few bumps of volatility, which is why investors might expect better financial performance from companies involved with Bitcoin as trading and transaction fees are likely to increase. For this reason, investors can make sense of a renewed upside potential in shares of Coinbase Global Inc. NASDAQ: COIN. Shares of Coinbase took a 15% dip during the week the company’s quarterly earnings were reported, and that’s a reaction not many had been expecting, considering the high price of Bitcoin right now and its popularity within the trading platform. However, cooler heads prevailed after the dip had settled, as some in the market realized that not even at its 52-week high did the Coinbase stock price reach its full earnings growth potential. Now that it has fallen to only 71% of its 52-week high, Coinbase could become a major dip-buying opportunity. Understanding Wall Street's perspective on companies is crucial because there is a very specific and important relationship between valuation multiples and earnings growth. This key ratio is called the price-to-earnings growth ratio (PEG), and it measures whether future earnings growth is already factored into the price. Seeing that Coinbase could deliver $2.02 in earnings per share (EPS) for the second quarter of 2026, a massive jump compared to today’s reported $0.12 in EPS, this much earnings growth is going to take an equally high valuation multiple to be considered priced in. That doesn’t seem to be the case today for Coinbase, as its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50.6x (while still high) does not at all reflect this much EPS growth for the future, which is why investors will see a PEG ratio of only 0.5x today. Any measure below 1.0x for a PEG directly suggests that growth is not priced into the stock’s valuation. Living and breathing these sorts of indicators and language, Wall Street analysts had no choice but to step in and give the broader market a more useful point of view for Coinbase stock outside of its recently bearish price action, and that is one solid piece of data that investors can take home as well. Wall Street analysts will not often boost a stock’s rating or valuation targets during such a bearish price action as seen in Coinbase stock, so any positive reinforcement means a lot more during these times. When it comes to Coinbase, here is where analysts see the stock reaching up to: Coinbase still has a Hold consensus rating, but a bullish call from Citigroup analyst Peter Christiansen has drawn attention. He upgraded the stock to Buy and raised his price target from $270 to $505—a significant shift. With shares trading near recent lows, the new target suggests meaningful upside for investors. In fact, this opinion implies that Coinbase stock should rally by roughly 60% from where it has fallen to today, giving investors a reason to look deeper into it. Of course, this future EPS growth is at the helm of delivering on this promise, but now investors need to go back full circle. Coinbase’s earnings are likely to grow as long as the market stays in risk-on mode, keeping interest in Bitcoin high. That would support trading volumes and transaction fees, helping justify Wall Street’s current forecasts for EPS and valuation.
