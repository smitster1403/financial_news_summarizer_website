Delta Corp shares however plunged 7 percent. During its meeting which concluded on September 3, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council reduced the GST rate on pre-packaged and labelled namkeens, bhujia, mixture, chabena and similar edible items from 12 percent to 5 percent. This will likely spur demand, benefitting these companies. Prataap Snacks shares gained more than 3 percent, while Bikaji Foods and Gopal Snacks shares were up around 2 percent each. ""The sharp, broad-based reduction in the GST rates of most food and key personal care categories could revive consumption partially. Easing commodity prices (tea palm, coffee), good monsoon, favorable base for urban consumption, the recent personal income tax reduction and the upcoming pay commission augur well for FMCG consumption in the next 12-15 months. Lastly, this GST-rate cut would offer some headroom for price increases in the medium term (2HFY27/FY2028),"" said Amit Agarwal, SVP- Fundamental Research, Kotak Securities. Delta Corp shares meanwhile plunged nearly 7 percent. This comes after the GST Council decided to increase the tax levied on admission to casinos, race clubs, any place having casinos or race clubs, or sporting events like the IPL from 28 percent to 40 percent.

The GST reduction is expected to provide significant relief to the real estate and infrastructure sectors. Analysts said it could boost demand in the housing segment, as lower construction costs may be passed on to buyers, making homes more affordable. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog The new GST rate will take effect from September 22, 2025, and applies to all major categories of cement, including Portland cement, aluminous cement, slag cement, super sulphate cement, and similar hydraulic cements, whether coloured or in clinker form. These products, previously taxed under the highest 28 percent slab, will now fall under the 18 percent bracket. The reduced tax burden is likely to lead to lower retail cement prices, potentially spurring higher offtake from both retail and institutional buyers. Global brokerage Jefferies described the GST cut on cement as a strong positive for the sector, calling it a long-awaited move that could structurally improve industry dynamics. While Jefferies does not expect a major surge in demand purely from price elasticity, it noted that the new tax regime could aid pricing discipline and support profitability in the medium term. The brokerage also highlighted that companies will now be able to claim full input tax credit on coal—a key raw material—following the increase of GST on coal to 18 percent from 5 percent.

The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Auto index up more than 3 percent. The Nifty Auto index was hovering around 26,612.20, the highest level seen in nearly 11 months. During its meeting which concluded on September 3, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council reduced the GST rate on all small cars from 28 percent to 18 percent. This includes petrol, LPG or CNG cars with engine capacity up to 1200 cc and length up to 4000 mm, and diesel cars with engine capacity up to 1500 cc and length up to 4000 mm. The 10-point cut is expected to shave 5-7 percent off ex-showroom prices of popular models such as Maruti Swift, Hyundai i10, Tata Punch and compact SUVs like the Brezza and Venue. While small hybrids that qualify as small cars will also benefit from the 18 percent slab, larger petrol-electric and diesel-electric hybrids have been pushed into the top tax bracket. GST on auto Vehicles with engines above 1200cc (for petrol) or 1500cc (for diesel), or length exceeding four metres, will now attract 40 percent GST, up from 28 percent. Pure EVs remain taxed at just 5 percent, signalling the government's preference for direct EV adoption. However, removal of cess that was previously applicable over and above the GST, is likely to result in marginal relief for premium and luxury vehicles as well as for hybrids. Cess, in the range of 1 percent to 22 percent was earlier charged above the 28 percent GST rate for different class of vehicles. This cess will now no longer be applicable, helping some categories of large vehicles to benefit from this move, despite GST rate moving up to 40 percent. Premium and luxury vehicles remain heavily taxed, with cars and SUVs that fall outside the small car definition continuing in the 40 percent bracket.

"GST reset fuels demand hopes: M&M, Maruti, Hero Moto, Eicher Motors, Escorts among beneficiaries",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gst-reset-fuels-demand-hopes-m-m-maruti-hero-moto-escorts-ashok-leyland-among-beneficiaries-13518385.html,"Auto stocks such as Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki India, Hyundai Motor India, Hero MotoCorp, Eicher Motors, Ashok Leyland, and Escorts Kubota are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries of the new GST tax reforms, as sweeping rate cuts have been announced across categories - from hatchbacks and SUVs to tractors and commercial vehicles. Analysts believe the tax relief will trigger a 5 to 10 percent demand surge across multiple segments, setting the stage for a potential re-rating of auto stocks in the medium term. Nomura analysts forecasted volume growth of 3 percent YoY for passenger vehicles and 5 percent YoY for two-wheelers in FY26F, but expect an additional 5 to 10 percent volume uplift following the GST cuts. Shridhar Kallani, auto analyst at Axis Securities, described the decision as “very positive” for the sector. He noted that the small passenger vehicle segment, which has been in prolonged decline over the past 18 to 24 months, may finally be nearing a bottom, while entry-level motorcycles could also be poised for recovery after several quarters of weakness. Passenger vehicles: small cars and SUVs get a boost Under the revised GST structure, small cars - defined as vehicles under four meters in length with petrol engines up to 1,200cc or diesel engines up to 1,500cc will now be taxed at 18 percent, down sharply from 28 to 31 percent earlier. Large SUVs (over four meters) will attract a 40 percent GST rate, compared with 43 to 50 percent previously, while electric vehicles continue under the concessional 5 percent rate. Analysts at Emkay noted that the meaningful reduction in on-road prices is expected to revive sales in the mass-market passenger vehicle segment and re-energise overall demand. Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) emerges as the largest beneficiary, enjoying a 10 percent GST cut across its portfolio. Roughly two-thirds of its models now fall in the 40 percent slab versus 50 percent earlier (including cess), while the remaining portfolio moves to 18 percent from 28 percent. Maruti Suzuki (MSIL) and Hyundai Motor India (HMIL) are also expected to reap sizeable benefits, with blended GST reductions of 7 to 8 percent across their offerings. For both companies, nearly one-third of the portfolio will see a 3 to 5 percent cut, while the other two-thirds enjoy reductions closer to 10 percent. Two-wheelers: fresh spark for under-350cc bikes The new GST rates for two-wheelers lower taxation on motorcycles under 350cc to 18 percent from 28 percent earlier, while those above 350cc are taxed at 40 percent. Kallani of Axis Securities, estimated that the cuts could result in a 7 to 9 percent decline in on-road prices. With two-wheeler volumes still trailing the FY19 peak, analysts believe this tax cut has the potential to trigger a much-needed fresh growth cycle. According to Emkay, the benefits will be broad-based across leading manufacturers. Hero MotoCorp (HMCL) will enjoy a 10 percent cut across 94 percent of its portfolio volumes, while Eicher Motors’ Royal Enfield brand will benefit from a similar 10 percent cut on 81 percent of its models. TVS Motor Company (TVSL) gains from a 10 percent reduction across 70 percent of its range, while Bajaj Auto secures benefits on 49 percent of its portfolio, expanding to 65 percent when three-wheelers are included. Despite the higher GST of 40 percent now levied on models above 350cc, Royal Enfield remains a clear net gainer, with 81 percent of its portfolio benefiting, and only 8 percent adversely impacted by the hike, analysts said. Tractors and CVs join the GST party The GST cut for commercial vehicles, including trucks, buses, and ambulances, to 18 percent from 28 percent earlier, is expected to lower on-road prices by up to 10 percent, according to Kallani. This makes fleet renewal more affordable, encouraging operators to expand capacity. Beyond the direct sales impact, the move could yield wider economic benefits by enhancing goods movement, improving logistics efficiency, and reducing overall transportation costs. Perhaps the most significant, particularly from a rural perspective, is the cut in GST on tractors and agricultural machinery to 5 percent from 12 percent. The steep reduction directly lowers acquisition costs for farmers, thereby enhancing affordability. Kallani highlighted M&M, Escorts (ESC), and VST Tillers as the major beneficiaries in Farm and Equipments space.

Track the latest updates on GIFT Nifty right here on Moneycontrol. After a choppy session, buying interest in metal stocks drove Dalal Street to rise over half a percent on Wednesday, September 3. Investors also awaited further details from the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meeting, which will drive near-term moves. Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Gains) The GIFT Nifty is trading higher at around 24,947, indicating a strong start for the day. Asian Equities (Up) Asian equities were primed to rise Thursday after weak US job openings reinforced bets on a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut, boosting stocks and bonds on Wall Street. US Equities (Up) Wall Street stocks recovered some ground on Wednesday after technology conglomerate Alphabet rose on a favorable antitrust ruling, but gains were muted as investors digested softer-than-expected labor market data and a selloff in long-term global government bonds. Job openings, a measure of labor demand, dropped 176,000 to 7.181 million by the last day of July, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said in its ""JOLTS"" report on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 7.378 million unfilled jobs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.05%, the S&P 500 rose 0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite added about 1%. US Bond Yield (Down) The yield on 10-year Treasuries and 2-year Treasuries were trading lower in the early trade on Thursday. Dollar Index (Flat) The U.S. dollar softened on Thursday in a volatile week as investors contended with bond market jitters while weighing data that showed a weakening labour market, which reinforced expectations the Federal Reserve will cut rates this month. Asian currencies (Mixed) Asian currencies were trading mixed in the early trade on Thursday. However, on a year-to-date basis, except the Indonesian Rupiah, all other currencies gained between 1-7 percent. Crude (Down) Oil fell after a report that the OPEC+ alliance will consider a fresh round of production increaseswhen the group meets over the weekend. Gold (Flat) Gold held near an all-time high after a seven-day rally, as weak US data spurred more bets on aninterest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve this month and mounting concerns over the central bank’s independence underpinned haven demand. Fund Flow Action The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) extended their selling on the eighth day as they sold equities worth Rs 1,666 crore on September 03, while Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) continued their selling on the seventh consecutive session as they purchased equities worth Rs 2495 crore on the same day.

Asian stocks rise as weak US jobs fuel Fed bets,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-to-rise-as-weak-us-jobs-fuel-fed-bets-13518338.html,"Asian equities climbed with Wall Street after weak US job openings data reinforced bets on a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut. Shares in Japan, Australia and South Korea gained at the open. Equity-index futures for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 edged higher after both gauges advanced. Australian bonds tracked Wednesday’s moves in Treasuries, with yields on the 10-year declining almost five basis points to 4.37%. Oil dipped, while gold steadied. With job openings falling to a 10-month low, traders are now almost fully pricing in a September Fed cut and projecting at least two reductions this year. The shift lifted equities, snapping a two-day losing streak for US stocks, and supported Treasuries a day before a pivotal US payrolls report. The data is “another sign that the labour market is slowing down,” wrote Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne. “The dynamic boosts the case for rate cuts.” Economists project about 75,000 jobs were added in August, based on the median of a Bloomberg survey, while the jobless rate is seen at 4.3%. Four straight months of sub-100,000 payrolls growth would mark the weakest such stretch since the onset of the pandemic in 2020. “A large downside surprise in labor market data could push rates sharply lower given the concern around the Fed’s labor mandate,” said TD Securities strategists including Oscar Munoz and Gennadiy Goldberg. “We remain biased long on dips and expect rates to move lower throughout the year.” Also, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said on CNBC that the central bank should begin lowering rates in September and make multiple cuts in coming months, adding that officials could debate the precise pace of reductions. Investors will also focus on a bond auction in Japan Thursday, which faces added uncertainty from a global debt market turmoil and political instability at home. Meanwhile, borrowers from across the globe are rushing into the bond market, with more than $128 billion of sales so far this week, and investors are lapping up the new debt.",Asian equities climbed with Wall Street after weak US job openings data reinforced bets on a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut.,"With job openings falling to a 10-month low, traders are now almost fully pricing in a September Fed cut and projecting at least two reductions this year.",Asian equities climbed with Wall Street after weak US job openings data reinforced bets on a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut.,"“We remain biased long on dips and expect rates to move lower throughout the year.” Also, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said on CNBC that the central bank should begin lowering rates in September and make multiple cuts in coming months, adding that officials could debate the precise pace of reductions.",negative,0.9292891025543213
"Markets likely to react positively to GST booster dose for FMCG, auto, insurance, consumer durables and MSMEs, say experts",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/markets-likely-to-react-positively-to-gst-booster-dose-for-fmcg-auto-insurance-consumer-durables-and-msmes-say-experts-13518332.html,"With the government announcing major cuts in GST rates for various sectors including auto, FMCG and consumer durables, the market is expected to react positively to the decisions that many are calling a ‘historic Diwali gift’, say experts. They add that the decision of merging rates into 5% and 18% -- while reserving 40% for sin goods -- will benefit many sectors like FMCG, auto, insurance, consumer durables and MSMEs among others ahead of the festive season. “The new GST regime merges slabs into 5% and 18%, with 40% for luxury goods. Essentials, durables, and insurance see major tax relief. Sectors like FMCG, auto, insurance, and MSMEs will benefit, driving demand, easing compliance, and supporting economic growth ahead of the festive season,” said Ninad Jadhav, Equity Research Analyst, LKP Securities. Also Read: 'Historic Diwali gift' for common man, students, farmers: How new GST reforms will impact you? In a similar context, Vineet Gala, Founder at Xylem PMS, said that the overall package is “very positive."" ""By removing the 12% and 28% slabs, the move reduces ambiguity and aligns India with global best practices,” he said while adding that the sentiment has already turned constructive, with “clear benefits for consumption-driven sectors such as textiles, apparel, footwear and FMCG.” According to him, lower taxes on footwear and clothing up to Rs 2,500 are expected to spur festive demand, while exemptions for senior citizens’ health insurance and cuts on life-saving drugs strengthen the welfare push. “The council’s assurance of clearing refunds under the inverted duty structure within seven days is another boost. Though businesses will face short-term adjustments around pricing, stock revaluation and compliance, the overall direction is market-friendly, pro-consumption and supportive of long-term growth,” said Gala. Also Read: Big tax reform: GST slabs reduced to two; hundreds of items set to get cheaper from September 22 Among food items, cheese, butter, ghee, oil, confectionary, chocolates, pasta, pastry, cakes, biscuits, coffee, ice cream, jams, drinking water, fruit juice, and beverages containing milk will see a lower GST from September 22. Also Read: From soaps to snacks: GST cut to 5% to boost FMCG demand ahead of festive season Further, GST on several household products has been slashed from higher slabs to just 5%. Hair oil, shampoo, toothpaste, toilet soaps, shaving cream and toothbrushes will now attract 5% down from the earlier 18%. Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist at Omniscience Capital, said the footwear and apparel cuts would have a “double impact” on both demand and supply. “Consumers are likely to benefit from lower prices, driving higher volume demand. Exporters impacted by US tariffs can also redirect some supply to the large domestic market, where even marginal increases in demand will be enough to absorb the pressure,” he said. He pointed out that India’s domestic market for footwear, at nearly $30 to 35 billion, dwarfs its $300-500 million US exports. “Similarly, textile exports to the US stand at $10 billion, while the domestic market is around $110 billion, making local absorption feasible,” Gupta said while adding that the government’s commitment to fast-tracking refunds would improve liquidity and sentiment. “It clearly shows determination to mitigate and counter the impact of US tariffs. We should expect more such steps going forward.” Incidentally, the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI) has welcomed the government’s decision of aligning the GST on MMF fibre and yarn at 5% from 18% and 12% earlier, respectively. “It addresses the long-standing blockage of working capital for thousands of spinners and weavers. With over 70-80% of textile and apparel units in India being MSMEs, this reform will directly benefit a large segment of the industry by easing liquidity pressures, enhancing competitiveness,” said Rakesh Mehra, Chairman, CITI. Also Read: Diwali comes early for auto sector: GST slashed on small cars, 2Ws, 3Ws, CVs Meanwhile, vehicles have also seen major rationalisation. Petrol, diesel and CNG cars in specified categories, earlier taxed at 28%, will now attract 18%. Three-wheelers, motorcycles up to 350cc and commercial vehicles for goods transport as well will come in the 18% bracket. Consumer durables will also see noticeable price drops. Air conditioners, televisions above 32 inches (including LED and LCD), monitors, projectors and dishwashers have all been brought down from 28% to 18%. According to Karthik Mani, Partner - Indirect tax, BDO India, apart from rate rationalisation, the GST Council has also made some important changes in the GST laws to ease the process of obtaining registrations for small businesses supplying through e-commerce platforms and also for quick grant of refunds on provisional basis. “Another important announcement is commencement of filing appeals before the GSTAT by September and commencement of hearing before the end of the calendar year, which resolves a long-standing demand of the taxpayers,” he said.

Bulls continued to support the market breadth for the third straight day, with about 1,884 shares advancing compared to 894 declining shares on the NSE. The uptrend is expected to strengthen if the frontline indices decisively surpass short- and medium-term moving averages. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Nilesh Jain, Head- Equity Technical & Derivative Research at Centrum Broking ITC Hotels | CMP: Rs 250.65 ITC Hotels has broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart, indicating a potential trend continuation. A decisive break above Rs 255 could trigger a fresh rally towards new all-time highs. In the short term, we expect the stock to surpass resistance and move towards the Rs 270 level, supported by strong momentum post-breakout. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 270 Stop-Loss: Rs 241 Coal India | CMP: Rs 389.8 Coal India has formed a strong base and recently broke out from a falling trendline, supported by higher-than-average volumes, indicating strong buying interest. It is now trading comfortably above all key short-term and long-term moving averages, reflecting underlying strength in the trend. Furthermore, momentum indicators and oscillators on the daily chart have confirmed a bullish crossover, adding conviction to the bullish setup. Based on this technical structure, we anticipate the stock to move towards Rs 410 in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 410 Stop-Loss: Rs 378 GMDC | CMP: 459.7 Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation has broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart, suggesting a continuation of the uptrend. The breakout was supported by strong volume participation, indicating solid underlying strength in the stock. The pattern-based target is projected around Rs 501, with immediate support at Rs 440. Given these technical factors, the stock is likely to maintain its positive momentum in the short term, and a buy-on-dips approach is recommended. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 501 Stop-Loss: Rs 440 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives at SBI Securities Jindal Steel and Power | CMP: Rs 1,028.35 Jindal Steel has been moving in a Rs 1,022–942 range since the start of August. The stock broke out of the range and gave a horizontal trendline breakout on Wednesday. The breakout was also supported by robust volumes. On September 1, the stock formed a piercing line candlestick pattern around its 100-day EMA and rose sharply since then. Momentum indicators are also supporting the bullish narrative. The daily RSI crossed the 60 mark, and its upward trajectory reflects improving strength in price action. On the other hand, ADX—a key trend strength indicator—shows DI+ crossing above DI-, reinforcing the bullish outlook. This confluence of price breakout, volume confirmation, and supportive trend and momentum indicators suggests that Jindal Steel is poised for further upside in the near term. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,025–1,035 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 999 Pondy Oxides & Chemicals | CMP: Rs 1,165.5 Pondy Oxides marked a high of Rs 1,209 on July 31 and thereafter witnessed a throwback. During this period, volume activity was mostly below average. The stock tested its 34-day EMA multiple times, found support, and formed a strong base, suggesting accumulation at lower levels. On Wednesday, the stock gave a symmetrical triangle pattern breakout along with robust volume. It is now trading above its key moving averages, which reinforces the bullish undertone. The RSI is firmly positioned in the bullish zone, inching towards the 60 mark, reflecting improving price strength. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,160–1,170 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,250 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,130 One 97 Communications | CMP: Rs 1,288.3 Paytm has been moving in a higher high, higher low formation on the daily chart, indicating that the stock is in a strong uptrend. It managed to hold on to its short-term key moving average—the 20-day EMA—during the recent consolidation phase and moved up steadily, reflecting strong bullish sentiment. The Paytm/Nifty ratio chart has given a major horizontal trendline breakout and is at a fresh high, indicating likely outperformance in the short term. Adding to the positive setup, the daily RSI is in bullish territory and continues to rise, reflecting strong bullish momentum. On the derivative front, all the strikes from Rs 1,200 to Rs 1,260 saw Call writers exiting (bears exiting) and strong Put writing (bulls entry), supporting the bullish outlook. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,285–1,295 levels.

Kalyan Jewellers shares rise 2% after report says Warburg eyes Rs 850-crore stake in Candere,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/kalyan-jewellers-shares-rise-2-after-report-says-warburg-eyes-rs-850-crore-stake-in-candere-13515947.html,"The shares of Kalyan Jewellers gained more than 2 percent on September 3 after a report said that international private equity firm Warburg Pincus is in discussions with the jewellery-maker to buy some stake in its lifestyle brand Candere. Warburg Pincus is eyeing 10 percent stake in Candere for Rs 800-850 crore, the Economic Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. The New York-based company will likely purchase part of this stake from Kalyan Jewellers, while the rest will be newly issued shares in Candere, the report added. Candere will use the proceeds from the issue of new shares to expand its presence, it further said. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. Notably, Warburg Pincus had remained an investor in Kalyan Jewellers since 2014 before fully exiting the company last year. In August 2024, Warburg Pincus sold its last 9.17 percent stake to institutional investors and TS Kalyanaraman - the promoter of the jewellery chain. For the April-June quarter of the financial year 2026, Kalyan Jewellers reported a revenue of Rs 66 crore and a net loss of Rs 10 crore for Candere, which was founded in 2013. The lifestyle brand's number of showrooms stood at 81 at the end of the quarter. Kalyan Jewellers shares later pared some gains to trade 0.6 percent higher at Rs 511.75 apiece.

The bitter truth about sugar stocks: Why the ethanol induced rally may not last,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/the-bitter-truth-about-sugar-stocks-why-the-ethanol-induced-rally-may-not-last-13515951.html,"Sugar stocks were on a tear after New Delhi sweetened its ethanol blending roadmap, sending shares of Balrampur Chini, Shree Renuka Sugars, Dhampur Sugar, and others higher in recent sessions. But the rally may soon lose steam, analysts warn, as India’s chronic production shortfalls and flat ethanol prices could limit mills’ incentive to divert cane away from sugar, undermining the bullish narrative. Yesterday, the Supreme Court upheld the rollout of 20 percent ethanol-blended petrol, supporting the government’s roadmap, while the Centre removed all restrictions on producing ethanol from sugarcane juice, syrup, B-heavy, and C-heavy molasses for the 2025–26 marketing year. On paper, it looks like a win-win—more cane, more ethanol, more profits. In reality, the sweetness is tempered by structural challenges. The bitter truth Analysts at InCred Capital highlighted that sugar production forecasts rarely match reality. Every year, estimates start sweet but end up disappointing. Forecasts keep inflating, but outcomes collapse like a May heatwave—loud, sweaty, and brutally honest. In 2023–24, output was projected at 34 million metric tonne (MMT), but the final number was closer to 29.5 MMT. For 2024–25, the estimate has already been cut from 35.5 MMT to 28 MMT. The new 35.25 MMT forecast for 2025–26 could face the same fate if rains disappoint or recovery rates dip. ALSO READ: Does the liberal ethanol feedstock policy really boost sugar mills’ earnings prospects? The brokerage firm maintained a ""reduce"" rating on sugar-based players such as Balrampur Chini and Triveni Engineering, citing policy headwinds, while recommending an “add” rating on grain-based distilleries like BCL Industries, Gulshan Polyols, and Globus Spirits. While sugar production woes are just the tip of the iceberg, the detail lies in the devil, wherein mills don't prefer ethanol diversion over selling retail sugar. With India on track to hit its 20 percent blending target in CY25, sugar’s share in ethanol supply is shrinking because of poor margins. Of the 7.23 billion litres supplied till July in Ethanol Supply Year 2025 (ESY25), only 38 percent came from sugar, with the remaining 62 percent were sourced from grains like rice and maize. The reason is simple: ethanol made from cane juice or B-heavy molasses is less profitable. Ethanol diversion losing its sweetness Analysts at JM Financial underlined the problem in pricing. For example, in 2024–25, the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of cane jumped to Rs 3,400 per quintal from Rs 3,050 in 2022–23. However, ethanol prices from B-heavy (Rs 60.73/litre) and juice (Rs 65.61/litre) haven’t been revised for over two years. With an average yield of 22 litres of ethanol per quintal of cane, revenue works out to roughly Rs 1,450, far below the FRP, resulting in negative margins. By contrast, sugar prices in India have remained stable to strong (Rs 36–38/kg wholesale in 2024–25). Selling sugar directly at Rs 38.20/kg generates Rs 3,820 per quintal, substantially higher than ethanol revenues, making sugar sales the preferred route for mills despite policy incentives. While government policies create an alternative revenue stream through ethanol blending, the current pricing structure does not make it financially compelling compared to traditional sugar sales. With sugar production expected to rise and closing balances projected at 7–8 MMT for Sugar Season 2026 (SS26), analysts suggested the government could permit higher sugar exports, as sugar supply will likely absorb any incremental ethanol diversion. So far this year, sugar stocks have delivered mixed results: Shree Renuka Sugars, Dhampur Sugar, and Dwarikesh Sugar have dropped up to 30 percent, whereas Balrampur Chini and EID Parry have risen as much as 22 percent.

The GST Council, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, is meeting in New Delhi on September 3-4 to deliberate on the Centre's proposal for a simplified rate structure of 5 percent and 18 percent. For footwear, it is being reported that GST on items priced above Rs 2,500 is likely to be increased to 18 percent from 12 percent, however, items below Rs 2,500 may see GST reduced to 5 percent from the existing 12 percent. Relaxo Footwears shares are higher by 3 percent while Campus Activewear shares are up nearly 1.5 percent. Khadim India shares gained more than a percent while Red Tape shares jumped around 2 percent. Currently, GST rate on hotel rooms is fixed at 12 percent for room tariffs up to Rs 7,500 per night, and 18 percent for room tariffs exceeding Rs 7,500 per night. The GST Council is set to deliberate upon simplification of the tax structure, and removal of the 12 percent GST slab. Hotel companies with room rates mostly below Rs 7,500 per night saw their shares rise sharply, ahead of the outcome of the GST meet outcome. ITC Hotels shares jumped nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 252 apiece, while Lemon Tree Hotels and Chalet Hotels shares rose more than 2 percent each. EIH and Samhi Hotels shares surged more than 3 percent each. IHCL shares rose nearly 2 percent.

That said, better yielding SME (reclassified) has been a key growth driver for the bank (up 30% YoY) and now contributes nearly 20.5% of its loan portfolio (nearly the same as the corporate portfolio size). The management highlighted that the bank’s SME portfolio is skewed toward high-ticket loans which, hence, does not pose much risk to asset quality for now, although the bank may face some growth pressure amid the ongoing trade war. ICICIB has lost market share in home loans due to higher pricing; however, it has realigned pricing in line with peers (Exhibit 15) which should help partly offset the expected growth normalization in SME. Overall, loan growth is expected to remain soft through FY26, prompting a cut of 70bps in our growth estimate to around 11.5% (though still better ex-Kotak). So far, it has shown margin resiliency vs peers which may contract amid the ongoing rate cut cycle, though it may continue to outperform peers given its better portfolio mix (asset/liability). Outlook Notwithstanding the near-term margin pressure across banks, as also for ICICIB (though lower), we believe the bank is well positioned to deliver peer-best RoA of 2.1-2.3% over FY26-28E, aided by better cost management, core fees, and contained LLP. This, coupled with credible top management, leadership pool, digital banking edge, and asset quality resiliency, should help the bank command premium valuations versus large-cap PVBs. Thus, we retain BUY while revising up our TP by 6% to Rs1,700 (from Rs1,600), rolling forward on 2.6x Sep-27E ABV and subs valuation at Rs270/sh.

Tata Steel shares are the top gainers on the index, rising nearly 6 percent, while SAIL and Jindal Steel & Power shares jumped more than 5 percent each. Hindustan Copper shares rose nearly 5 percent. Welspun Corp and Hindalco Industries shares jumped over 3 percent each, while JSW Steel shares rose nearly 3 percent. NMDC and Vedanta shares were up around 2 percent each, while Hindustan Zinc and shares were up around 1 percent. Here are some key factors driving the stocks higher: Weaker Dollar The US dollar has seen recent weakness after one report by DBS said, quoted by Reuters said that Trump's appointments to the Fed are likely to further weigh on the dollar. ""Already, the labour market is softening, and Chair Powell has signalled the possibility of rate cuts at Jackson Hole,"" the note said. ""This means that the overvalued USD could ease again as markets anticipate coming Fed rate cuts."" A weaker dollar improves global demand for commodities, like metals, which in turn benefits Indian metal companies through higher export opportunities and better pricing. China's Plan to Cut Steel Output China has plans to cut steel production between 2025 and 2026, according to an official document reviewed by Reuters, in an effort to tackle overcapacity. A reduced steel output from China will likely lower dumping of cheap metals into the Indian market, which in turn could benefit Indian metal players. CLSA said it expects the spreads to improve and Indian mills to see a rise in their profitability, according to the note cited by CNBC-TV18. CLSA tweaked FY26-28 EBITDA estimates for metals and mining companies under its coverage by -4 percent to +8 percent. It noted that it continues to favour aluminium, given tighter demand-supply balance. GST Reform Hopes The GST Council, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, is meeting in New Delhi on September 3-4 to deliberate on the Centre's proposal for a simplified two-rate structure of 5 percent and 18 percent. ""GST reforms and rate cuts together can spur growth by lowering compliance costs, improving efficiency, and boosting affordability. Reduced GST on housing or construction inputs supports real estate demand, while cheaper financing from rate cuts aids both homebuyers and capital-intensive industries like metals,"" said Pranay Aggarwal, Director and CEO of Stoxkart. US Fed Rate Cut Hopes US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on August 22 had said that a weaker job market may soon force the American central bank to cut interest rates. ""Downside risks to employment are rising,"" according to Powell's remarks at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, last month. Most investors now expect a 25 bps Fed rate cut during its upcoming meeting on September 16-17. A rate cut in the US could reduce borrowing costs for foreign investors, encouraging them to invest in higher growth markets such as India, potentially boosting metal stocks. Also Read: Our LIVE blog on stock market updates Strong Q1 GDP Indian economy grew 7.8 percent in the June quarter, beating RBI's 6.5 percent projection and the 6.6 percent median recorded in a Moneycontrol poll. A stronger GDP growth may spur confidence in Indian economy's growth, which in turn can boost the metal stocks. “While domestic demand remains subdued, the market is pinning its hope on post-monsoon recovery, government capex, and GST recalibration. Recent developments would lead to a tighter pricing range, adding duration to earnings and potentially boosting valuation,” said Emkay Global while noting that its key picks in the sector are Tata Steel and SAIL. MOIL, which is not part of the metal index, saw its share price rise by nearly 5 percent. This came after the company reported its best-ever August production with 17 percent growth on-year to 1.45 lakh tonnes. “On the sales front, the company also delivered strongly with 1.13 lakh tonnes of sales in August 2025, reflecting a remarkable 25.6% growth year-on-year. Further, during April–August 2025, MOIL recorded its best-ever performance with 7.92 lakh tonnes of production (up 9.3% y-o-y) and 50,621 meters of exploratory drilling (up 8.6% y-o-y),” it added.

SMBC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG), Japan’s second-largest banking group with total assets of $2 trillion as of December 2024 and a significant global presence. This approval comes close on the heels of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) nod last month for SMBC’s plan to acquire up to 24.99 percent of Yes Bank’s paid-up capital and voting rights. The transaction traces back to Yes Bank’s May 9, 2025, disclosure that SMBC would purchase a 20 percent stake via a secondary deal, comprising 13.19 percent from State Bank of India (SBI) and 6.81 percent collectively from seven other banks including Axis Bank, Bandhan Bank, Federal Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IDFC First Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank. Following this deal, SMBC will emerge as the single-largest shareholder in Yes Bank. Separately, the RBI has also approved the re-appointment of Rama Subramaniam Gandhi as part-time Chairman of Yes Bank from September 20, 2025, until May 13, 2027.

The company has received approval to foray in African markets, beginning with Nigeria, Uganda, and Zambia as these markets offer attractive prospects for revenue diversification, operational scalability, and long-term value creation, the firm said in a statement. ""Indus Towers will leverage its robust financial position and anchor customer relationship with Bharti Airtel to establish a strong and competitive presence in these regions. As part of its broader growth strategy, the company will continue to evaluate expansion opportunities in other African markets where Airtel has an established presence,"" the statement said. Brokerages reaffirmed their bullishness, highlighting Indus Towers' attractive valuations. Citi maintained a buy rating on Indus Towers with a target price of Rs 460, noting that investor concerns over delayed payouts, Vi’s financial health, and Bharti’s slower rollouts are overstated. The brokerage highlighted the potential for medium-term growth, strong free cash flow generation, and moderating capex intensity, which could support higher shareholder returns. Citi added that valuations remain attractive versus peers, with its bear-case scenario indicating limited downside risk. CLSA retained its high conviction outperform call on Indus Towers with a target of Rs 520, pointing to the board’s approval for an international foray beginning with Nigeria, Uganda, and Zambia. However, with fewer than 500 towers in these markets, revenue diversification is expected to remain limited. Instead, the brokerage expects management to prioritize capital structure improvement through higher dividends. CLSA flagged the ongoing delay in distributions as unjustified despite the board’s commitment to reinstating payouts. Indus Towers has not declared any dividend since May 2022, citing pending dues from its major client Vodafone Idea. Earlier this year, the company was expected to consider a bonus issue, share buyback, or both at its May board meeting. However, the meeting was postponed, which weighed on investor sentiment and pulled the stock lower. At 9.18 a.m., shares were quoting Rs 315.95, lower by 4.1 percent on the NSE compared to the previous session's closing price.

Asian stocks poised to track Wall Street declines,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-poised-to-track-wall-street-declines-13514178.html,"Asian stocks were poised to mirror a weak US session, where equities fell alongside bonds amid a rush of corporate-debt sales and worries over developed-world budgets. Equity-index futures pointed to a weaker open in Japan and Australia and a tepid open for Hong Kong. Earlier, the S&P 500 pared losses to close 0.7% lower. US contracts edged 0.2% higher in early Asia trading. Alphabet Inc. gained in after-hours trading as a federal judge ruled Google won’t be forced to sell its Chrome browser. US 30-year bond yields neared 5% on Tuesday, weighing on tech shares whose valuations had stretched during a surge from April lows. The dollar rose and gold climbed to a record. The yen weakened after a report said Japan’s ruling party is set to call for early party elections. Traders are contending with a range of concerns, from key economic data and US tariffs to Federal Reserve independence, monetary policy and global fiscal prospects. This comes as the stock market appears to be at a crossroads, with the S&P 500 having logged its smallest monthly gain since July 2024, just before what is historically the weakest month for equities. Along with a slew of corporate sales, there’s been renewed concern about longer-dated global debt after years of issuance exacerbated budget deficits. In the UK, the yield on long-dated bonds hit the highest since 1998 and the pound sank as pressure mounted on Prime Minister Keir Starmer to manage the budget. Long bonds are under real pressure from poor deficit and debt metrics in many countries and, in the US, from Fed-related concerns, according to Nomura. “A breach of 5% on the US 30-year will likely further increase the focus on these issues,” said Andrew Ticehurst, a Nomura Holdings Inc. strategist in Sydney. In Asia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. will be in focus after the US revoked the company’s authorization to freely ship essential gear to its main Chinese chipmaking base. TSMC’s US-listed American depositary receipts slipped as much as 2.3% Tuesday. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said his administration would ask the Supreme Court for an expedited ruling in hopes of overturning a federal court decision that many of his tariffs were illegally imposed. “The stock market’s down because the stock market needs the tariffs. They want the tariffs,” the president said. Traders will be looking to key US labor market data this week for clues on economic growth and the Fed’s policy outlook. Employers showed little enthusiasm to take on workers during August, and the unemployment rate probably ticked up to an almost four-year high, adding to evidence of a more subdued jobs market. The importance of this week’s economic data will ultimately drive where yields are by Friday’s close – even if there is a lot that could shift investors’ perception of the state of the labor market in the interim,” said Ian Lyngen and Vail Hartman at BMO Capital Markets. On the economic front, US factory activity shrank in August for a sixth straight month, driven by a pullback in production that shows manufacturing remains bogged down by higher import duties. “The ISM manufacturing report indicated that companies are largely managing headcount rather than actively hiring,” said Scott Helfstein at Global X. “This may be a clue ahead of Friday’s jobs numbers. New jobs are likely slowing, but meaningful revisions to data over the prior months could mean that the report, good or bad, may not influence investors much.” Helfstein said investors should pay close attention to wage growth in Friday’s job report. “Wages have been outpacing inflation and that is usually a good sign for consumption,” he said. “While defaults are going up slightly, most of the numbers on consumer behavior have remained robust.”",“This may be a clue ahead of Friday’s jobs numbers.,"The importance of this week’s economic data will ultimately drive where yields are by Friday’s close – even if there is a lot that could shift investors’ perception of the state of the labor market in the interim,” said Ian Lyngen and Vail Hartman at BMO Capital Markets.",Traders will be looking to key US labor market data this week for clues on economic growth and the Fed’s policy outlook.,"The importance of this week’s economic data will ultimately drive where yields are by Friday’s close – even if there is a lot that could shift investors’ perception of the state of the labor market in the interim,” said Ian Lyngen and Vail Hartman at BMO Capital Markets.",positive,0.6133751273155212
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Godrej Consumer Products, Sobha, Jindal Steel, Britannia Industries, Manappuram Finance, and others on September 03?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-godrej-consumer-products-sobha-jindal-steel-britannia-industries-manappuram-finance-and-others-on-september-03-13514163.html,"Equity benchmarks saw profit booking at higher levels and closed the session with moderate losses on September 2, but the market breadth was dominated by bulls. A total of 1,737 shares gained against 1,043 shares that saw correction on the NSE. The consolidation is expected to continue as long as the frontline indices trade below short-term moving averages. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities Godrej Consumer Products | CMP: Rs 1,283.8 Godrej Consumer Products has given a breakout of its symmetrical triangle chart pattern with a bullish candlestick formation, along with incremental volume activity. Additionally, on daily and weekly charts, it has formed a higher bottom series; therefore, the structure of the stock indicates further bullish momentum in the coming horizon. Unless it is trading below Rs 1,240, positional traders can retain an optimistic stance and look for a target of Rs 1,380. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,380 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,240 Jindal Steel & Power | CMP: Rs 975.15 On the daily charts, Jindal Steel & Power is in a rising channel chart formation with a higher high and higher low series pattern. The counter witnessed a steady recovery from trendline support levels. Additionally, the technical indicator RSI is also indicating a further uptrend from current levels, which could boost bullish momentum in the near future. For positional traders, Rs 940 would be the decisive level. Trading above the same, the uptrend formation will continue till Rs 1,040. However, if it closes below Rs 940, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,040 Stop-Loss: Rs 940 Sobha | CMP: Rs 1,460.2 On a daily timeframe, Sobha had been in a downtrend. Therefore, it is currently in an oversold territory and available near its demand area. The texture of the chart formation and technical indicator RSI indicate that the stock is very likely to rebound for a new leg of the up move from its demand zone. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,405 could be the trend-decider level for the bulls. If it sustains above the same, we can expect further uptrend towards Rs 1,560. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,560 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,405 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Britannia Industries | CMP: Rs 5,891.5 The FMCG sector continued to outshine post the announcement of GST 2.0, in which Britannia is one of the top performers. In the previous session, the stock managed to close in green despite major indices falling, and now it is trading on the edge of giving a breakout of the rounding bottom pattern on the daily chart. Also, prices have been protecting the prior day’s low on a closing basis for the past 6 trading sessions, indicating consistent buying. Along with this, KST (Know Sure Thing) has already turned above the signal line (red), and now if it trades above the zero line, it can trigger a fresh rally in the stock. The current trend for Britannia looks positive. For now, a break above Rs 5,930 can lift prices higher towards Rs 6,160, followed by Rs 6,300. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,160, Rs 6,300 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,700 Saregama India | CMP: Rs 491.9 In the previous session, Saregama India was up by 1.5%. Prices have managed to protect the prior day’s low for the past 4 trading sessions, indicating steady buying in the stock. On the daily chart, the stock is currently trading in a rectangular range of Rs 467–505 since July 2025, which indicates accumulation. As of now, prices are on the verge of a breakout of the said consolidation, and a break above the upper end of the range, i.e., near Rs 505 levels, can trigger a fresh rally in the stock. Prices have just closed above the 50-day Simple Moving Average, but follow-up buying is required to confirm the breakout. The trend for the stock looks positive. For now, a break above Rs 505 can start a fresh move on the upside towards Rs 530, followed by Rs 550. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 530, Rs 550 Stop-Loss: Rs 480 Manappuram Finance | CMP: Rs 281 Manappuram Finance has been outperforming its sector and continued to follow its upward sloping trendline since February 2025. In the previous week, prices found support near the trendline and have seen a reversal of more than 8% from it. Also, prices have closed above the prior day’s high for two consecutive days, which is a positive sign. For now, acceptance above Rs 285 is required for upward momentum to continue. Along with this, the 15-period EMA and 30-period EMA have recently witnessed a bullish crossover, which further reinforces the positive outlook for the stock. The current trend is bullish. A break above Rs 285 can lead to a trending move towards Rs 300, followed by Rs 315.

M&M shares dropped more than 2 percent to trade at Rs 3,247 apiece, emerging as the top loser on the Nifty 50 index. Tata Motors shares were down nearly 1 percent to trade at Rs 685 apiece. The Indian tax panel has proposed to increase the GST rate to 18 percent from the current 5 percent for EVs priced between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 40 lakh, Reuters reported. For cars priced above Rs 40 lakh, the panel has recommended raising the GST rate to 28 percent as such vehicles cater to the ""upper segment"" of the society and are largely imported rather than manufactured domestically, it added. ""The uptake of electric vehicles is increasing and while, the low rate of 5% is to incentivise faster adoption of electric vehicles, it is also important to signal that higher-priced EVs can be taxed at higher rates,"" Reuters quoted a document by the tax panel as saying. The GST Council, which is set to meet between September 3 and September 4, to review prospective GST reforms, already has a proposal to completely do away with the 28 percent GST slab to introduce a simpler tax structure. Hence, the council may increase the tax on EVs to 18 percent or put them in the newly planned 40 percent category planned for certain luxury goods, the report cited a government source as saying. Domestic automakers like Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors have limited offering in the segment which reportedly faces a possible GST hike. If implemented, this will have a stronger impact on the luxury EV makers like Tesla, BYD, Mercedes and BMW, the report added. In July 2025, Tata Motors led the Indian electric car market with nearly 40 percent market share, while M&M held 18 percent share. BYD held a 3 percent market share, while Mercedes and BMW together accounted for 2 percent of the market. Tesla is taking bookings but is yet to start deliveries. The Nifty Auto index dropped 1 percent intraday to its day's low. M&M and Tata Motors shares were among the top losers on the index, along with Tube Investments of India.

"Nalco, DLF, other metal and real estate stocks rise up to 5%: Fed rate cut hopes, 4 other reasons behind rally",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nalco-dlf-other-metal-and-real-estate-stocks-rise-up-to-5-fed-rate-cut-hopes-4-other-reasons-behind-rally-13511357.html,"The shares of metal and real estate companies surged on September 2, buoyed by multiple factors. The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the two sectoral indices into the green, leading gains on the market today. The Nifty Metal index rose 1.3 percent to hover around 9,426, and the Nifty Realty index gained 1.33 percent to 891.50, as seen at 12.10 pm. Here are 5 possible triggers for the sharp rise in the stocks: US Fed rate cut hopes: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on August 22 said that the weak job market may soon force the American central bank to cut interest rates. ""Downside risks to employment are rising,"" according to Powell's remarks at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium. Most investors now expect a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut during its upcoming meeting which is scheduled between September 16 and September 17. A rate cut in the US could reduce borrowing costs for foreign investors, encouraging them to invest in higher growth markets in India. This boosts real estate and metal stocks. Additionally, investors expect the RBI to follow Fed in the pursuit of a rate cut, if any. This too can positively impact the stocks. GST reforms: The GST Council, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, is slated to meet in New Delhi on September 3-4 to deliberate on the Centre's proposal for a simplified two-rate structure of 5 percent and 18 percent. According to market experts, this simplicity in the tax structure will reduce the cost of developers and benefit homebuyers. Pradeep Aggarwal, Founder & Chairman, Signature Global (India) Ltd said that housing sector stands to benefit from these reforms, as moving to a two-slab structure will not only make GST compliance easier for real estate developers, but also help rationalise input costs, improve cash flows and eventually reduce the cost of homes for buyers. Strong Q1 GDP numbers: Indian economy grew 7.8 percent in the April-June quarter of the ongoing financial year. This is the highest growth recorded in five consecutive quarters, beating economists' estimates. Gross domestic product (GDP) topped both the RBI's 6.5 percent projection and the 6.6 percent median recorded in a Moneycontrol poll. The GDP growth was also stronger than the 7.4 percent rate recorded in the preceding three months (Q4 FY25) and 6.5 percent recorded a year earlier (Q1 FY25). The strong GDP numbers may have spurred confidence in Indian economy's growth, which in turn boosted the real estate and metal stocks. Weak dollar: The US dollar is hovering near a multi-month low. Trump's appointments to the Fed are likely to further weigh on the dollar, according to DBS. ""Already, the labour market is softening, and Chair Powell has signalled the possibility of rate cuts at Jackson Hole,"" the analysts wrote. ""This means that the overvalued USD could ease again as markets anticipate coming Fed rate cuts."" A weaker dollar improves global demand for commodities, like metals, which in turn benefits Indian metal companies through higher export opportunities and better pricing. China aims to cut steel output: China aims to cut steel production between 2025 and 2026, according to an official document reviewed by Reuters. The country's move aims to tackle overcapacity that has hit prices significantly. Reduced steel output from China will reduce dumping of cheap metals into the Indian market, which in turn will benefit the Indian metal companies. On the metal index, National Aluminium Company (NALCO) shares gained nearly 5 percent to emerge as the top gainer. NMDC shares followed, rising nearly 4 percent. Hindustan Copper, Steel Authority of India (SAIL), Tata Steel, APL Apollo Tubes, Hindustan Zinc and JSW Steel shares gained up to 3 percent. On the real estate index, Phoenix Mills shares gained 3.5 percent to trade at Rs 1,570 apiece and emerge as the top gainer. Anant Raj and DLF shares jumped up to 3 percent. Godrej Properties, Oberoi Realty and Raymond shares gained nearly 2 percent each. ""Real estate and metal stocks have emerged as notable gainers after facing pressure in earlier months. The combination of infrastructure-led demand growth, record commercial real estate performance, and favourable GST rate cut expectation is presently leading both sectors outperformance,"" said Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group. GST reforms and rate cuts together can spur growth by lowering compliance costs, improving efficiency, and boosting affordability, said Pranay Aggarwal, Director and CEO of Stoxkart. ""Reduced GST on housing or construction inputs supports real estate demand, while cheaper financing from rate cuts aids both homebuyers and capital-intensive industries like metals. These measures enhance investment, stimulate domestic demand, and strengthen overall market sentiment,"" he added. India’s real estate sector is in a structural upcycle, with housing sales in the top seven cities crossing 180,000 units in H1 2025, the highest in 15 years, said Jickson Sajee Research Analyst, INVasset PMS. ""With private equity inflows exceeding $3.5 billion in H1, the sector is attracting capital, while large, disciplined developers are consolidating market share,"" Sajee added. Indian metal firms are countering through integration, efficiency, and green steel investments, keeping medium-term prospects strong despite near-term volatility, Sajee further said.

Additionally, retail rental income clocked a similar 12% CAGR during this period, mirroring the consumption growth. We anticipate this positive growth trend to continue, primarily driven by the ramp-up of new malls. As of 1QFY26, trading occupancy stood at 89%, down from 91% in Mar’25. Flat or declining consumption in certain mature assets is linked to ongoing revamps and tenant churn. In Bengaluru, approximately 10% of the leasable area is currently under fit-outs or being repurposed from hypermarkets to high-performing fashion anchors. Pune is undergoing a similar transformation, replacing outdated anchors and restaurants with newer, more relevant offerings. Management remains optimistic about the long-term performance, projecting strong growth from FY27 onward once the revamps are completed. Outlook We upgrade our rating to BUY with a revised TP of INR2,044 (earlier INR1,673), implying upside potential of 35%.

The brokerage upgraded Sun TV to “buy” from “sell” and significantly raised its price target to Rs 680 for the next 12 months and Rs 840 over the next three years. These targets imply an upside potential of 25 percent in the short term and 54 percent over the long term. Avendus Spark said it now views Sun TV as a fast-growing sports company rather than a stagnating linear TV broadcaster. It highlighted that Sun TV has the highest listed exposure to the Indian Premier League (IPL) among media peers, making it the purest proxy for investors to participate in India’s sports monetisation opportunity. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog The brokerage expects Sun TV’s IPL revenue to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9 to 12 percent between 2025 and 2027, reaching Rs 15,000 crore. Its IPL franchise, Sunrisers Hyderabad, is projected to contribute nearly 60 percent to the company’s sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation. Avendus Spark has applied a 40x price-to-earnings multiple to Sun TV’s IPL business and 10x to its core broadcasting business. In a strategic move to expand its sports portfolio, Sun TV’s board in July approved the acquisition of a 100 percent stake in Northern Superchargers Ltd., a London-based cricket franchise that competes in The Hundred, a professional league run by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). The deal is valued at £100.5 million (approximately Rs 1,161 crore).

Gold futures have crossed the key Rs 1.05 lakh per 10 grams-mark on MCX. The rising gold prices bodes well for gold financiers, as it increases the value of the collateral while issuing loans. This reduces the risk of default, as the collateral becomes more valuable relative to the loan amount issued against it. Manappuram Finance shares gained nearly 3 percent to trade at around Rs 282 apiece, nearing a record high level after extending gains for the second consecutive session. The stock has now gained more than 8 percent in two days. IIFL Finance shares gained nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 447.50 apiece, also extending gains for the second day. Muthoot Finance shares meanwhile gained over 2 percent to hit an intraday high of Rs 2,768 apiece. Gold futures with October expiry on the MCX hit an all-time high of Rs 1,05,937 per 10 grams yesterday. The contracts are hovering near the record high level today. This comes amid heightened global uncertainties. A weaker dollar and growing expectations for a U.S. interest rate cut this month are supporting the rising gold prices, said Manav Modi, Analyst – Precious Metal -Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Analyst expect the bull run in gold prices to continue. ""A softer US dollar and renewed safe-haven demand supported the rally, as investors turned to gold amid ongoing uncertainty surrounding US monetary policy. Growing political pressure may accelerate the timeline for interest rate cuts, with markets largely pricing in a 25 bps reduction in September—a development that remains supportive for bullion,"" said Axis Securities. Manav Modi from Motilal Oswal Financial Services also noted that the precious metals were up on safe-haven buying. ""Along with increasing rate cut expectations, tensions between Israel and Gaza and other geo-political tensions and the tariff escalations are continuously supporting buying in bullions, as increased expectations of a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut this month lifted bullion's allure…Increase in festive and wedding demand, ETF buying and Increased premiums in China are some of the additional factors supporting gold’s bull run,"" he added.

Speaking to Fox News, Bessent said, ""I think at the end of the day, two great countries will get this solved."" He said the slow progress in India-US trade talks was one of the reasons behind US President Donald Trump-led US administration's decision to raise tariffs. He however criticised India's imports of Russian oil, which he said might be fueling Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. ""The Indians have not been great actors in terms of buying Russian oil and then reselling it, financing the Russian war effort in Ukraine,"" he said. Speaking about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit, Bessent said it is largely performative. ""I think at the end of the day, India is the most populous democracy in the world. Their values are much closer to ours and to China's than to Russia's,"" he added. Bessent's remarks may have spurred trade talk hopes between India and US, triggering a rally in the export-oriented textile and shrimp stocks. Gokaldas Exports shares jumped nearly 5 percent to trade at Rs 733 apiece, while KPR Mill shares surged nearly 3 percent. Raymond Lifestyle shares gained more than 3 percent, while Arvind Fashions sharers rose nearly 3 percent. Avanti Feeds shares rallied around 7 percent, while Apex Frozen Foods shares jumped more than 4 percent. Notably, these companies derive a major portion of their revenue from US exports. These stocks earlier tumbled after US increased its tariffs on Indian imports to a whopping 50 percent, the highest among its Asian peers. US President Donald Trump recently lashed out at India, calling the relationship between India and US ""a totally one-sided disaster"". In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, ""What few people understand is that we do very little business with India, but they do a tremendous amount of business with us. In other words, they sell us massive amounts of goods, their biggest “client,” but we sell them very little … They have now offered to cut their Tariffs to nothing, but it’s getting late. They should have done so years ago.""

The broking house upgraded its rating on the stock, while hiking its target price to Rs 2,044, which indicated a 35 percent upside from current levels. At 9.55 a.m., shares of the firm were quoting Rs 1,583.7, higher by 4.4 percent. During FY15-25, Phoenix Mills' retail portfolio witnessed an 11 percent CAGR in consumption, supported by ~7 percent like-for-like growth in the existing malls and the opening of new malls in Lucknow, Indore, Ahmedabad, Pune, and Bengaluru. Additionally, retail rental income clocked a similar 12 percent CAGR during this period, mirroring the consumption growth. Going ahead, Motilal Oswal anticipates this positive growth trend to continue, primarily driven by the ramp-up of new malls. The brokerage estimated a 21 percent CAGR in retail rental income over FY25-27E to reach Rs 2,800 crore by FY27E and total income to reach Rs 3,900 crore. While new malls continue to ramp up well, the firm is implementing measures to accelerate consumption at mature malls. These initiatives, along with a further increase in trading occupancy, will help Phoenix Mills sustain healthy traction in consumption. Further, the company continues to diversify and expand its office portfolio within its existing mall properties across key locations. Notable developments include office spaces at malls in Bengaluru (1.2msf), Chennai (0.4msf), and Palladium Mumbai (1.1msf). ""Additionally, newly launched malls in Pune (1.2msf) and Bengaluru (1.2msf) are also contributing to the growth of Phoenix Mills' office segment. These strategic expansions highlight the firm's commitment to increasing its office presence in high-demand urban areas,"" said Motilal Oswal. Motilal Oswal also said Phoenix Mills’ acquisition of the remaining 49 percent stake in Island Star Mall Developers (ISMDPL) will strengthen its premium retail portfolio and unlock long-term value. The deal is expected to be earnings-accretive from the first year, with further upside as rental income stabilizes and the 2.71 msf incremental FSI potential is developed over the medium term. Staggered payments over three years are likely to keep the net debt-to-equity ratio below 0.4x for the next two years.

"Sugar stocks rally up to 20% after govt allows ethanol production from sugarcane juice, molasses",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sugar-stocks-rally-up-to-12-after-govt-allows-ethanol-production-from-sugarcane-juice-molasses-13510529.html,"Sugar stocks surged in morning trade on September 2 after the government decided to remove limits on ethanol production from sugarcane juice, sugar syrup, and molasses for the year 2025-26. The government had restricted production of ethanol from sugarcane juice, syrup and all types of molasses in the current marketing year amid a drop in sugarcane supplies. In the new ethanol supply year starting from November 1, sugar mills and distilleries will be allowed to produce ethanol without any quantitative restriction, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution said. The Department of Food and Public Distribution (DFPD) will periodically review the sugar diversion to ethanol to ensure year-round domestic availability of the sweetener, it said. This comes as sugarcane supplies are expected to jump in the new season as ample monsoon rains for two straight years have helped farmers expand area under the crop. Balrampur Chini Mills shares jumped more than 7 percent to trade at Rs 580 apiece, while Shree Renuka Sugars shares rallied over 15 percent to trade at Rs 33 apiece. Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar and Godavari Biorefineries shares gained 12 percent and 5 percent respectively. Uttam Sugar Mills shares rallied over 9 percent, while Dhampur Sugar Mills and Magadh Sugar & Energy shares were trading around 10 percent higher. Triveni Engineering shares were up 4.5 percent, while Dwarikesh Sugar and other stocks gained up to 14 percent. Smallcap stock Rajshree Sugars & Chemicals meanwhile surged 20 percent to hit the upper circuit at Rs 45.26 apiece. Earlier yesterday, the Supreme Court dismissed a plea which challenged the nationwide rollout of 20 percent Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP-20). The petitioner had alleged that vehicles manufactured in India prior to April 2023 are not compatible with ethanol mix petrol. Vehicles as new as 2 years old are also not compatible with ethanol mixed petrol wherein the percentage of ethanol is 20 percent, despite the cars being BS-VI compliant, the person added. The plea, filed by advocate Akshay Malhotra, had sought a direction to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to ensure availability of ethanol-free petrol at all fuel stations. A bench headed by Chief Justice of India BR Gavai, along with Justice K Vinod Chandran, dismissed the plea. Attorney General R Venkataramani, opposing the petition, said that the matter had already been thoroughly examined before the policy’s rollout. He alleged that the petitioner was merely a “front” for a larger lobby and stressed that the policy benefits sugarcane farmers while also conserving foreign exchange. “Should people outside the country decide what fuel India should use?” the AG remarked.
