"Trump's tariffs bite off Rs 25,000 crore from shrimp exporters' profit, Andhra CM Chandrababu Naidu seeks Centre's help",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/trump-s-tariffs-bite-off-rs-25-000-crore-from-shrimp-exporters-profit-andhra-cm-chandrababu-naidu-seeks-centre-s-help-13549463.html,"Trump's tariffs may have caused a loss of Rs 25,000 crore to India's shrimp exporters, with up to half of the export orders facing cancellations, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has said. Chandrababu Naidu pegged the estimate in a letter to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and Fisheries Minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh, requesting government support for Andhra's aquaculture sector. “The taxes imposed by America majorly hit shrimp exports. It is estimated that a loss of Rs 25,000 crore would have occurred. Up to 50 percent export orders have been cancelled,” Chandrababu Naidu said in the letter. Andhra Pradesh makes up 80 percent of India's shrimp exports, worth over Rs 21,000 crore every year. During FY24, India exported record volume of seafood worth $7.38 billion, with USA and China being the major importers and frozen shrimp the largest export item, according to data from Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA). During FY25, India shipped seafood worth Rs 62,408 crore ($7.45 billion). Naidu has called for a Rs 100 crore corpus fund, cold storages, and seafood markets, adding that the state is ready to set up a shrimp producers' committee to ensure farm-to-market supply chains. The state government has also initiated support measures by getting aquaculture feed prices lowered by Rs 9 per kg and is considering subsidised power transformers for the farms. CM Naidu has also sought a one-time top-up loan of Rs 1 lakh under Kisan Credit Card scheme for the farmers. This comes as the European Union approved 102 additional seafood processing and export units from India just days ago, a move that will boost seafood exports and position the nation as a trusted supplier. ""This milestone will enable us to scale our EU trade, empower our farmer partners, and reaffirm India’s leadership in sustainable aquaculture and seafood exports,"" Chairman and Managing Director of Kings Infra, Shaji Baby John said on September 10. EU-bound exports from India had reached Rs 9,430 crore ($1.12 billion) last fiscal, led by frozen shrimps among the leading items. India is also in discussions with the EU for a wider FTA, with the next round of discussions scheduled on October 6-10. The EU is the third largest export destination for Indian shrimps, with US and China being the top two markets, in terms of turnover. In terms of quantity, China has emerged as the largest seafood export destination from India. CareEdge Ratings in a recent note had warned that if the current tariff levels persist, the hit on exports may be more pronounced next fiscal, and volumes may drop by up to 15 percent. India, along with Ecuador, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, and China are the largest players in the global shrimp export market with a combined market share of around 75% in value terms and 74% in volume terms. Despite the export levy, shares of Avanti Feeds and Kings Infra are higher by 10 percent and 5 percent respectively over the last one month, while shares of Waterbase are flat for the period.

Godfrey Phillips shares surge 9% after turning ex-bonus: Here's why you should ignore the 66% plunge,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/godfrey-phillips-shares-surge-9-after-turning-ex-bonus-here-s-why-you-should-ignore-the-66-plunge-13549379.html,"The shares of Godfrey Phillips appeared to have crashed around 66 percent in one single session on September 16, as the stock price adjusted to a bonus issue of shares. The stock in reality jumped more than 9 percent after turning ex-bonus. Godfrey Phillips' board of directors during a meeting in August had approved the issue of bonus shares in the ratio of 2:1. The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the bonus equity shares was set on September 16. What is a bonus issue? A company announces bonus issue of shares to reward its existing shareholders with an investment opportunity, which is perceived to be attractive. While the issue of bonus shares increases the total number of shares issued and owned, it does not change the market capitalization of the company. This increases the overall liquidity of the stock, and makes it more affordable for other investors to add to their portfolio, creating strong upside potential for the stock. Godfrey Phillips share price: Key details As a result, Godfrey Phillips’ shares appeared to have crashed 66 percent in one session, while in reality, they simply adjusted to the bonus issue. The stock jumped more than 9 percent to hit an intraday high of Rs 3,720 apiece. After the issuance of bonus shares, the company's market capitalization stands at around Rs 57,401 crore and the stock's P/E ratio nears 161. The issuance of bonus shares will likely increase investors' confidence for the stock, as it reflects on the firm's strong financials and growth potential. Bonus issue essentially are free shares offered by a company from its reserves. Investors must own shares of the company as on the record date to be eligible for the bonus issue.

Asian stocks gain at open after Wall Street rally,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-gain-at-open-after-wall-street-rally-13548551.html,"Asian stocks posted modest gains at the open after Wall Street hit fresh highs ahead of an expected Federal Reserve interest-rate cut this week. Shares in Japan, Australia and South Korea opened higher, with the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index hovering near its record high. S&P 500 contracts were steady, as a $14 trillion record-breaking run in US equities headed for an inflection point, with the expected rate cut set to dominate a week that will shape policy for half of the world’s 10 most-traded currencies. Bets on Fed easing sent the S&P 500 above 6,600 on Monday, while the Nasdaq 100 posted its longest advance since 2023. Also aiding sentiment was a framework deal to keep TikTok running in the US, with President Donald Trump saying he’d talk to China’s Xi Jinping on Friday. A gauge of the dollar steadied after sliding in the prior session. Gold held its gains after rising to a new record. Signs of labor-market weakening and no major inflation surprises have sealed the deal for what money markets project will be a quarter-point Fed cut in September. The big question, though, will be the pace of easing after that, with prices stubbornly above the central bank’s 2% target. “Now the discussion will turn to how aggressively the Fed will act,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “The Fed may remind everyone that it may be focused on jobs now, but it hasn’t forgotten about the other half of its mandate.” In other Fed news, a US appeals court blocked the president from removing Governor Lisa Cook from her post while her lawsuit challenging the dismissal proceeds. Also, Trump’s economic adviser Stephen Miran is on his way to joining the central bank’s board after the Senate confirmed him to the post. On Wednesday, US policymakers will also release their quarterly update of economic and rate forecasts — known as the dot plot — and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold his regular post-decision press conference. In June, Fed officials were narrowly in favor of two quarter-point cuts in 2025. What traders will really hang on to is the tone of Powell’s press conference and the “dot plot” projections, according to Fawad Razaqzada at City Index and Forex.com. “I’ll be watching how the market reacts to any mention of inflation being ‘well anchored’ or the labor market ‘cooling more than expected’,” he said. “That sort of language would be music to the ears of dollar bears. On the flip side, a cautious Fed that hints at a ‘wait and see’ approach might stall the rally, at least temporarily.” Separately, JPMorgan Chase & Co. will cut the weight of the largest bond issuers in its flagship emerging-market index, diverting investor flows from the likes of China and India toward smaller nations.","Also, Trump’s economic adviser Stephen Miran is on his way to joining the central bank’s board after the Senate confirmed him to the post.","S&P 500 contracts were steady, as a $14 trillion record-breaking run in US equities headed for an inflection point, with the expected rate cut set to dominate a week that will shape policy for half of the world’s 10 most-traded currencies.",Signs of labor-market weakening and no major inflation surprises have sealed the deal for what money markets project will be a quarter-point Fed cut in September.,"On the flip side, a cautious Fed that hints at a ‘wait and see’ approach might stall the rally, at least temporarily.” Separately, JPMorgan Chase & Co. will cut the weight of the largest bond issuers in its flagship emerging-market index, diverting investor flows from the likes of China and India toward smaller nations.",negative,0.8913156986236572

A total of 1,539 shares advanced compared to 1,283 declining shares on the NSE. The market may remain consolidative with rangebound trading until the August high is decisively broken. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Cochin Shipyard | CMP: Rs 1,807.8 Cochin Shipyard has established a strong technical base with a triple-bottom pattern in the Rs 1,650–1,700 zone, reinforcing investor confidence at lower levels. The stock has now given a trendline breakout, further validated by a bullish divergence on the MACD histogram, signaling a likely shift in momentum. Adding to the positive setup, the price has managed to close above the R4 Camarilla monthly pivot—a crucial breakout level—indicating strength in the current trend. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 1,820–1,780 zone, with an upside target of Rs 2,100. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,650 ITI | CMP: Rs 322.55 ITI is showing encouraging signs of strength after successfully holding near its previous demand and breakout zone, reinforcing a solid support base. The stock has recently managed to close marginally above the monthly pivot, a breakout level that often signals continuation of an uptrend. On shorter timeframes, hourly charts are reflecting bullish divergence, further validating the possibility of momentum picking up in the near term. This confluence of technical indicators suggests an attractive risk-reward setup. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 325–315 zone, with an upside target of Rs 380. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 380 Stop-Loss: Rs 290 Aditya Birla Real Estate | CMP: Rs 1,866.2 A strong base formation is observed in the Rs 1,780–1,830 zone, providing a solid support area for Aditya Birla Real Estate. This zone also coincides with a previously established demand zone, reinforcing its significance. Recently, a trendline breakout has been witnessed around this region, supported by a positive signal on the MACD histogram, which indicates a shift in momentum. Such technical alignment between base formation, demand zone support, and momentum breakout strengthens the case for potential upside. As long as prices hold above the Rs 1,780–1,830 zone, the outlook remains constructive, with scope for a sustained move higher in the near term. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 1,840–1,870 zone, with a target of Rs 2,050. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,050 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,755 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital NBCC India | CMP: Rs 107.66 NBCC has witnessed a breakout from a flag and pole chart pattern in the prior week, signaling a potential bullish continuation. Additionally, the stock has shown a mean reversion from the 50-week EMA, which aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, indicating strong buying interest at key technical support. On the momentum front, the RSI has exhibited a bullish divergence, and the positive crossover further reinforces the likelihood of a trend reversal, suggesting building upward momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 121 Stop-Loss: Rs 102 Olectra Greentech | CMP: Rs 1,647.4 Olectra Greentech has shown positive price action across multiple timeframes, reflecting sustained bullish momentum. On the monthly chart, the stock is forming a higher top–higher bottom structure, indicating a strong uptrend. On the weekly timeframe, the stock found support near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, from where it has resumed its upward trajectory—signaling renewed buying interest and bullish sentiment. Furthermore, the RSI remains above 60, reinforcing the view of sustained positive momentum in the stock. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,877 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,560 Nava | CMP: Rs 705 Nava has been in a sustained uptrend since the 2020 bottom, and recent price action suggests continued strength. On the monthly chart, the stock formed a base near its 12-month EMA, and the breakout in August indicates a robust price structure with the potential for further upside. On the weekly timeframe, the stock is trading firmly above key moving averages—namely the 5-, 12-, and 26-week EMAs—signaling strong trend alignment. Additionally, the RSI is holding near 70, highlighting solid momentum and sustained bullish sentiment. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 775 Stop-Loss: Rs 675 Sarda Energy & Minderals | CMP: Rs 626.15 Sarda Energy continues to remain in a strong uptrend on the monthly chart. In August, the stock broke out of a 10-month consolidation zone, signaling a shift in momentum. The current month reflects continued buying interest, further validating the breakout. The stock is now trading at all-time highs, indicating robust bullish momentum. Additionally, the presence of a bullish divergence adds strength to the overall positive outlook. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 725 Stop-Loss: Rs 595 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Lupin | CMP: Rs 2,046 Lupin has provided a breakout from the falling trendline, with short-covering data in its futures segment clearly indicating a short-term trend reversal from down to up. There has been clear Call unwinding at the Rs 2,040 and Rs 2,100 strikes, which is positive, and there have been aggressive Put additions as well, indicating support at lower levels. The stock is trading well above its maximum pain level of Rs 2,000, indicating that the short-term trend is positive. Buy Lupin Futures in the range of Rs 2,030–2,050. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,130, Rs 2,160 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,980 Siemens | CMP: Rs 3,293.7 Siemens has provided a breakout and a close above the symmetrical triangular pattern, with short-covering data in the futures segment, which is a positive sign in the near term. There were significant shorts in the stock, and with the short-term trend reversal in the price, further short covering can’t be ruled out. The options data suggests that above the Rs 3,300 strike, there will be additional short covering, as it has the highest Call base. Beyond these levels, there will likely be even more short covering. The stock has closed well above its maximum pain level of Rs 3,200; hence, there is good support at lower levels. Buy Siemens Futures in the range of Rs 3,300–3,320. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,420, Rs 3,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,230 Reliance Industries | CMP: Rs 1,399.3 Reliance Industries has provided a breakout from the falling trendline, with short-covering data in the futures segment, which is a positive trend reversal sign in the near term. The stock has closed at Rs 1,400 levels, which has the highest Call base; hence, this is also positive in the near term. There has been considerable Call unwinding from the Rs 1,360 to Rs 1,400 strikes, as well as Put additions at the Rs 1,400 strike, indicating support at lower levels. So, there is a higher probability of further short covering in the near term. Buy Reliance Futures in the range of Rs 1,400–1,405. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,460, Rs 1,480 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,370 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The appointed valuer is required to submit the valuation report within three months of the order date, following which the NSE must obtain a fairness opinion from a merchant banker within one month of receiving the valuation report. Both the valuation report and fairness opinion, along with NSE’s recommendations, must be submitted within 15 days of the fairness opinion’s receipt. Sebi’s interim order passed by Whole Time Member Kamlesh Chandra Varshney said, “PDCL is restrained from effecting the transactions agreed upon in the BTA dated February 14, 2025 for Slump Sale of its business undertaking to PJFCPL.” He further said, “If the proposed slump sale transaction is allowed to proceed, it could cause grave injustice to the public shareholders since the transaction would become irreversible upon execution.” Varshney justified the interim order and said, “I find that there exist sufficient grounds to form a prima facie opinion that the proposed slump sale transaction by PDCL may be detrimental to the interests of public shareholders and warrants urgent intervention by SEBI in form of interim directions.” The Interim order noted that prima facie findings of investigations have made a compelling case for passing directions, given the possible violations of the provisions of Sebi’s Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Regulations, 2003, and Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements Regulations, 2015 and other laws. Also Read: Sebi’s Jane Street order based on wider probe, sources cite legal precedent to withhold internal notes The order follows a complaint alleging that PDCL’s slump sale is being executed at an artificially low valuation to benefit promoter-related entities at the expense of public shareholders. It was claimed that the slump sale would result in the transfer of the company’s core profit-making business on undervalued terms, which had already led to a significant erosion of PDCL’s market capitalization. Sebi’s preliminary investigation revealed that the valuation reports submitted by PDCL focused exclusively on six physical assets, including industrial land, office premises, and plant machinery. No value was attributed to intangibles such as employees, goodwill, brand equity, or technical knowledge, which are core elements of a profitable going concern. The financial data from PDCL over the last five years has shown consistent positive operating as well as net profit, underscoring that standard industry practice requires business valuation to reflect the going concern’s value, rather than just individual assets. Sebi said the valuers were seemingly instructed to treat the slump sale as a mere sale of separate assets, in contradiction to the Business Transfer Agreement, which clearly described the transfer of the entire business undertaking as a going concern. PDCL’s market capitalization plummeted from Rs 428.76 crores before the slump sale announcement in December 2024 to Rs 139.74 crores by September 2025, a decline of nearly 70 percent. The stock price experienced sharp fall in correlation with major slump sale events, including the announcement of the board’s decision, the outcome of two extraordinary general meetings (EGMs) and the final shareholder approval of the transaction.

The company is also mandated to fully cooperate with the independent valuer and submit all information and documents as required. PDCL has 21 days to file its reply or objections to the Sebi order and may request a personal hearing.","Sebi said the valuers were seemingly instructed to treat the slump sale as a mere sale of separate assets, in contradiction to the Business Transfer Agreement, which clearly described the transfer of the entire business undertaking as a going concern.","Sebi’s interim order passed by Whole Time Member Kamlesh Chandra Varshney said, “PDCL is restrained from effecting the transactions agreed upon in the BTA dated February 14, 2025 for Slump Sale of its business undertaking to PJFCPL.” He further said, “If the proposed slump sale transaction is allowed to proceed, it could cause grave injustice to the public shareholders since the transaction would become irreversible upon execution.” Varshney justified the interim order and said, “I find that there exist sufficient grounds to form a prima facie opinion that the proposed slump sale transaction by PDCL may be detrimental to the interests of public shareholders and warrants urgent intervention by SEBI in form of interim directions.” The Interim order noted that prima facie findings of investigations have made a compelling case for passing directions, given the possible violations of the provisions of Sebi’s Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Regulations, 2003, and Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements Regulations, 2015 and other laws.","Sebi’s preliminary investigation revealed that the valuation reports submitted by PDCL focused exclusively on six physical assets, including industrial land, office premises, and plant machinery.","Sebi’s interim order passed by Whole Time Member Kamlesh Chandra Varshney said, “PDCL is restrained from effecting the transactions agreed upon in the BTA dated February 14, 2025 for Slump Sale of its business undertaking to PJFCPL.” He further said, “If the proposed slump sale transaction is allowed to proceed, it could cause grave injustice to the public shareholders since the transaction would become irreversible upon execution.” Varshney justified the interim order and said, “I find that there exist sufficient grounds to form a prima facie opinion that the proposed slump sale transaction by PDCL may be detrimental to the interests of public shareholders and warrants urgent intervention by SEBI in form of interim directions.” The Interim order noted that prima facie findings of investigations have made a compelling case for passing directions, given the possible violations of the provisions of Sebi’s Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Regulations, 2003, and Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements Regulations, 2015 and other laws.",negative,0.6977282166481018

Click to View More Outlook for September 16 Vaibhav Vidwani, Research Analyst at Bonanza Today, the Indian stock market ended on a negative note, snapping its recent winning streak as both the Sensex and Nifty 50 posted mild declines by market close. The Sensex fell by 118.96 points to settle at 81,785.74, while the Nifty 50 declined by 44.8 points, closing at 25,069.2. The negative sentiment was primarily attributed to global uncertainty ahead of the upcoming US Federal Reserve policy meeting, which kept investors cautious and led to subdued activity across Asian markets. Investors were also seen booking profits after a stretch of market gains, particularly in heavyweight IT stocks and consumer-facing sectors, mirroring international caution and reduced risk appetite. Broader market participation saw more decliners than advancers as nervousness crept in before US Fed policy signals and key global negotiations. Volatility remained low, with indices trading within tight bands through most of the session. Looking ahead, we can expect the market trend to remain muted and rangebound until there is greater clarity from the US Federal Reserve regarding its policy trajectory. Market participants remain watchful for global cues and domestic macroeconomic data, with buying expected on dips for fundamentally strong sectors such as BFSI, auto, and consumption.

""An Independent reputed third-party firm be appointed to conduct a thorough review of the Observations as soon as possible but not later than 30 days and present the report to the respective Board Committees,"" KRBL said after convening separate meetings of independent directors and the board, where the observations were 'discussed in detail'. ""Taking cognizance of the Observations and as a matter of good corporate governance, separate Meetings of Independent Directors and the Board were convened at a shorter notice today i.e. on Monday, September 15, 2025,"" KRBL added. Shares of the rice exporting company are still languishing near the lows of the day. KRBL said the findings of the report shall be shared with the relevant committees of the board. ""The respective Board Committees should deliberate on the report relating to their area of Observations and submit recommendations to the Board."" Investors had dumped the shares in early trading session, sinking it by nearly 10 percent following the statements of the independent director - disclosed by KRBL - triggered a selloff.

"Infosys' mega Rs 18,000-crore share buyback: What works and what doesn't? Here's what analysts say",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/infosys-mega-rs-18-000-crore-share-buyback-what-works-and-what-doesn-t-here-s-what-analysts-say-13546852.html,"Infosys share price came under pressure on Monday after the company announced its largest-ever share buyback of Rs 18,000-crore, with analysts pointing to tax implications as major dampener. The board of the IT major on September 11 approved repurchase of up to 10 crore fully paid-up equity shares of face value Rs 5 each, representing 2.41 percent of the total paid-up capital, at a price of Rs 1,800 per share. The buyback price reflects a premium of around 18 percent over Friday’s closing price on the NSE. At the end of the June 2025 quarter, Infosys reported free cash flow of Rs 7,805 crore. Despite the announcement, the counter slipped 1.6 percent to an intraday low of Rs 1,501.20 on the NSE in today's trading session, reversing gains made in the previous session on Friday. Analysts attributed the weakness to taxation rules and profit-booking. ""The acceptance ratio is likely to be low and this coupled with taxation doesn’t make the buyback an attractive proposition in the secondary market,"" said Sunny Agrawal, Head – Fundamental Research, SBI Securities. Tax Implications for Investors on Buybacks Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President – Research, Religare Broking, said investors’ decision to tender would largely depend on tax considerations. ""Since October 2024, buyback proceeds are taxed as dividend in shareholders’ hands, making the offer less attractive for those in higher tax brackets. For low-tax or tax-exempt investors, tendering could provide gains if the acceptance ratio, particularly under the small shareholder quota, is favourable,"" he noted. On Monday, IT stocks were broadly lower with the Nifty IT index slipping nearly 1 percent, led by selling across all 10 constituents. The decline came as global investors awaited US Federal Reserve cues on rate cuts. Ruchit Jain, Vice President, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said part of the positive impact was already factored in as reports on a buyback were circulating earlier. He added that the overall weakness in the IT sector had also weighed on sentiment. Additional concerns emerged after US President Donald Trump’s recent remarks on potential tariffs on IT services imports, which analysts said could impact margins for Indian exporters. ""Markets are pricing in the possibility of higher operating costs and slower client spending in the near term,"" said Harshal Dasani, Business Head, INVasset PMS. Dasani added that currency movements were also being tracked closely. ""An elevated INR against the dollar squeezes revenues when converted to rupees, putting short-term pressure on earnings,"" he said. What Investors Should Do? Experts suggested caution in the near term. ""The buyback signals confidence, but short-term volatility is being driven by policy and currency shocks,"" said Dasani. Mishra from Religare Broking added, ""Long-term investors may simply hold, as the buyback reduces equity by 2.4 percent and modestly enhances EPS."" Infosys Buyback History Infosys has previously undertaken four buybacks. The first was in 2017 for Rs 13,000 crore, followed by Rs 8,260 crore in 2019, Rs 9,200 crore in 2021, and Rs 9,300 crore in FY23. What is a Share Buyback? A share buyback is a process where a company repurchases its own shares, reducing the number of outstanding shares in the market.

"Prestige Estates, DLF, other real estate stocks jump up to 12%: Here are three reasons",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/prestige-estates-dlf-other-real-estate-stocks-jump-up-to-12-here-are-three-reasons-13547157.html,"The shares of several real estate companies jumped on September 15, pushing the Nifty Realty index up around 2.6 percent. The index emerged as top sectoral gainer on September 15. The Nifty Realty index rose to 908 in the afternoon, the highest level seen by the index in 13 sessions. Here are three reasons which may be boosting the sector. US Fed rate cut hopes: The US Federal Reserve is set to hold its FOMC meeting from September 16 to September 17. Analysts increasingly expect the American central bank to cut its rates this time, amid weakening jobs data and rising pressure from President Donald Trump's administration. The US economy likely created 911,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March than previously estimated, according to the latest data from Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. This further hiked rate cut hopes. While Indian real estate players are mostly domestic market oriented, analysts expect a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve to be followed by the same by its Indian peer RBI. A rate cut by RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee will reduce home loans EMIs for home buyers, spurring demand and thereby boosting real estate stocks. UP govt plans changes to bylaws for Noida, other areas, says report: The Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government is planning to remove the ground coverage limits and increase the floor area ratio for industrial, residential and commercial projects as part of its new common building bylaws for the three industrial development authorities—Noida, Greater Noida, and YEIDA, the Times of India reported citing sources. This will likely ease construction rules, boost investment and end confusion caused by differing regulations across authorities, the report further said, adding that the prospective rules will allow both vertical and lateral growth. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. If approved, these reforms will likely benefit the real estate players active in these areas, including Godrej Properties and DLF. Value Buying: The Nifty Realty index has sharply corrected from its record high level. The sectoral index is currently down more than 20 percent from its 52-week high of 1140.4. It has fallen nearly 10 percent in the past three months, and is down around 13 percent in 2025 so far. After such sharp correction, investors may have resorted to value buying, pushing the stocks higher. Govt considers 20-year tax break for data centres, says report Anant Raj shares were the top gainers on the index, skyrocketing around 12 percent to trade at Rs 598 apiece. This comes after a report said that the government is considering a 20-year tax break for data centres. Prestige Estates shares jumped nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 1,593 apiece. DLF shares also surged around 3 percent to trade at Rs 779 apiece. Phoenix Mills, Godrej Properties, Oberoi Realty and Macrotech Developers (Lodha) shares jumped nearly 3 percent each. Sobha, Brigade Enterprises and Raymond shares rose around 2 percent each.

This diversification was achieved via high growth in existing products like Construction Finance & Housing Finance growing at a CAGR of ~44% and ~48% respectively over FY22 to FY25. Further, the successful launch of Gold Loans via an addition of 562 branches in FY23, growing the branch base significantly led to consolidated 3 year AUM CAGR of ~51% over the same period. Gold Loans are the highest yielding product, improving portfolio yields by ~155 bps over FY23 to FY25. We forecast CGCL will be able to sustain these higher yields as Gold Loans now form a significant ~36% of the total AUM. Further, a rating upgrade is likely to improve Cost of Funds; whereas more efficient branch unit-economics & operational leverage will expand NIMs & improve the cost to income ratio. Outlook We value CGCL using the Residual Income Approach. We calculate Cost of Equity to be at 11.3% with ROEs projected to reach 18.3% by FY28E supported by Income Growth & softening costs. We initiate coverage with a “BUY” rating and upside of 22%, implying P/ABV of 2.9x / 2.5x of FY27E/FY28E.

Bucking the trend, Granules and Abbott India shares gained more than a percent each while Gland Pharma, Alkem Labs, Divi’s Labs and IPCA Labs shares were in the green with marginal gains. Uncertainty over Trump tariffs Despite easing trade tensions between India and US, the fear of higher Trump tariffs on pharma imports weighed on Indian exporters. While increasing tariffs on Indian exports to a whopping 50 percent, US President Trump had exempted pharma supplies for such levy. However, earlier in August, Trump said he eventually plans to increase the tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the US to 250 percent, without elaborating on the timeline or other details. Most Indian pharma companies derive a major portion of their revenue from exports to the US market. In an interview to CNBC International, Trump had said that he would begin with a “small tariff” but plans to raise it gradually - first to 150 per cent, and eventually to 250 per cent - within a year to 18 months. In April, the Trump administration had launched a Section 232 investigation into pharmaceutical imports, to examine if certain imports pose a threat to national security. “We want pharmaceuticals made in our country,” Trump told CNBC. BioSecure Act In 2024, the United States had introduced the BioSecure Act to enhance the security of biotechnology supply chains. While the bill successfully passed the House of Representatives, it failed to advance to the Senate. The bill sought to reduce China’s influence on America's biotech supply chains and safeguard against any potential biotech espionage. A diluted version of BioSecure Act is now again back into consideration in the US, as per some news reports. What Analysts Say? ""The Indian pharmaceutical sector has faced notable pressure in 2025, with leading companies seeing steep corrections amid pricing challenges in the US and regulatory headwinds...Despite these near-term headwinds, the structural outlook remains intact,"" said Kalp Jain, Research Analyst at INVasset PMS. ""India continues to supply over 20 percent of the world’s generic medicines, while rising domestic healthcare spending and insurance penetration provide steady growth drivers. Niche areas such as Contract Research, Development and Manufacturing (CRDMO) are gaining traction, with companies like Divi’s Laboratories and Piramal Pharma well-positioned to capture global outsourcing demand. Industry estimates suggest 25-30 percent potential upside in select CRDMO players, supported by strong order pipelines and differentiated models. Specialty drugs, complex generics, and branded formulations also offer promising opportunities to offset cyclical pressures in the US generics market,"" he added. Also Read: Our LIVE blog on stock market updates The Nifty Pharma index is down nearly 5 percent so far this year, and a recovery is expected to be gradual, according to pharma analysts. Regulatory clarity, easing pricing pressure in exports, and sustained traction in specialty therapies will be key triggers, said one market expert. ""While generic-heavy portfolios may take longer to recover, companies with diversified product lines, strong balance sheets, and leadership in high-margin categories appear better placed. With valuations moderating after recent corrections, selective accumulation in quality names could offer attractive returns once the broader sector stabilizes,"" Kalp Jain said. Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart meanwhile said, ""Pharma stocks are not following a uniform trend, as their performance is diverging based on company-specific fundamentals and news flows. However, the overall outlook for the sector remains positive, with the Nifty Pharma Index trading above all its key moving averages, indicating a bullish bias."" ""Nifty Pharma Index has broken out of an ascending triangle pattern, signaling a bullish trend reversal. Sustained buying interest above key moving averages indicates renewed momentum, positioning pharma stocks for further upside in the coming sessions.Laurus Labs, Zydus Life, and Lupin exhibit bullish chart patterns, breakouts above key averages, signaling strong technical upside momentum,"" said Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, Assistant Vice President – Research & Advisory at Master Capital Services Limited.

"Brooks Labs looks to exit carbapenem JV, OneSource may buy stake",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/brooks-labs-seeks-to-exit-carbapenem-jv-onesource-may-buy-stake-13546621.html,"Brooks Laboratories Ltd is looking to sell its 49 percent stake in Brooks Steriscience Ltd, a joint venture with Steriscience Specialties, sources have told Moneycontrol. The move comes after OneSource Specialty Pharma Ltd received the board's approval to evaluate a potential acquisition of the carbapenem manufacturing facility in Gujarat’s Vadodara, which makes antibiotics primarily used for severe, multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. This move could provide a significant cash infusion for Brooks. Established in 2015, the Vadodara facility has become a critical asset in the global anti-infectives supply chain, with approvals from key regulatory bodies including the USFDA, EU GMP, and ANVISA. Its strategic value was bolstered after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its meropenem 2g injection on June 23. It makes Brooks Steriscience the first company to receive clearance for the higher-strength formulation of meropenem, an antibiotic used to treat serious bacterial infections in adults and children, in the US market. The 2g strength provides a crucial dose option for treating serious infections. This regulatory milestone followed USFDA approvals for 0.5g and 1g meropenem injections in August 2022. Earlier this month, Brooks secured shareholder approval to divest its investment in Brooks Steriscience, citing the ""best interest of the company"". The potential buyer, OneSource Specialty, formerly Stelis Biopharma, announced in August that its board had given in-principle approval to evaluate the acquisition of Steriscience’s sterile injectable businesses, including the Vadodara facility. Brooks Laboratories' rationale for the sale is rooted in its recent financial performance. While the company saw a 107 percent jump in profit before tax to Rs 3.23 crore in FY25, its liquidity remains stretched, with working capital utilization hovering around 90 percent. The company also holds a guaranteed debt of Rs 65 crore on behalf of the joint venture. A successful divestment would strengthen Brooks' balance sheet, reduce its exposure to guaranteed debt, and free up capital to focus on its core business of critical care injectables and CDMO services. Promoters Atul Ranchal and Rajesh Mahajan, who hold 19.24 percent and 17.36 percent, respectively, in Brooks, are industry veterans with over two decades of experience. Their focus has been on expanding Brooks’ footprint in critical care, CDMO, and semi-regulated export markets. Both Ranchal and Mahajan couldn’t be reached for comments. The Brook Laboratories shares had risen almost 30 percent since its JV secured approval for meropenem 2g in the US. On the morning of September 15, the stock was trading at Rs 160 on BSE, up 1.3 percent from the previous close.",The company also holds a guaranteed debt of Rs 65 crore on behalf of the joint venture.,"The move comes after OneSource Specialty Pharma Ltd received the board's approval to evaluate a potential acquisition of the carbapenem manufacturing facility in Gujarat’s Vadodara, which makes antibiotics primarily used for severe, multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.","Their focus has been on expanding Brooks’ footprint in critical care, CDMO, and semi-regulated export markets.","It makes Brooks Steriscience the first company to receive clearance for the higher-strength formulation of meropenem, an antibiotic used to treat serious bacterial infections in adults and children, in the US market.",positive,0.918839156627655

What analysts say? The outperformance of small- and mid-cap indices over benchmarks signals a healthy broadening of the market, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS. ""In corrective phases, investors usually prefer large caps and index-heavy names for safety and liquidity, as they limit drawdowns even if returns are modest. But as markets edge towards record highs, fear subsides and risk appetite gradually returns, prompting flows into mid- and small-caps where growth potential is greater,"" he said. ""This shift is now evident, with the broader market taking leadership in the rally. Historically, such transitions mark the start of stronger participation from both retail and domestic institutions, creating breadth that supports sustainable uptrends. For long-term investors, this is a constructive development as it suggests the rally is not restricted to a few index movers but underpinned by wider earnings momentum and sectoral opportunities, reinforcing confidence in the resilience and depth of the current market cycle,"" he added. Explaining the technical side of the broader markets, Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, Assistant Vice President – Research & Advisory at Master Capital Services Limited, said, ""Smallcap and Midcap indices have delivered a bullish reversal, breaking out from a double bottom formation on daily charts. Both Nifty Smallcap 100 and Nifty Midcap 100 have crossed above key moving averages, confirming strength after weeks of consolidation. This signals renewed momentum and positions the broader markets to outperform benchmarks in the near term. Midcaps like TIINDIA, Nykaa, Alkem Labs and smallcaps like Welspun, Radico, KEC Intl show bullish breakouts, strong momentum, sector tailwinds.""

Vodafone Idea's share rise 6 percent as plea against DoT's AGR demand tentatively listed for hearing on September 19,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vodafone-idea-s-share-rise-6-percent-as-plea-against-dot-s-agr-demand-tentatively-listed-for-hearing-on-september-19-13546301.html,"Vodafone Idea's case against Department of Telecom's (DoT) assessment of the additional Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues is tentatively listed for hearing on September 19, as per news reports, sending the shares sharply higher by over 6 percent in early trade. The telecom firm had moved the Supreme Court seeking to quash the additional demand of AGR dues worth Rs 9,450 crore by the DoT, and argued that the demand exceeds the scope of the Court’s earlier ruling on AGR liabilities. Earlier on September 12, the Economic Times had reported citing people familiar with the development that the DoT is expected to file a submission defending the demand as a 'gap' in prior accounting, which was not calculated at the time of the Supreme Court's order in 2019. An affidavit in this regard was filed by the DoT before the apex court, the report said, justifying that the additional demand was not a reassessment or recalculation but due to completion of financial accounts. What the DoT is Seeking The DoT had raised an extra demand on AGR dues worth Rs 2,774 crore for FY18-19. The petition said that out of the total Re 9,450 crore of demand, Rs 2,774 crore pertains to post-merger entity — Idea Group and Vodafone Idea — following their August 2018 consolidation, while Rs 5,675 crore relates to the pre-merger Vodafone Group’s liabilities. Vodafone Idea has contested the calculation, claiming that certain amounts have been added twice and need reconciliation. The company has asked for a recalculation of dues, starting from the pre-FY17 period. Vi Engaged with the Centre The telecom major has been engaged with banks over additional funding, and those discussions have been moving forward. ""The banks are currently looking for some clarity on the AGR front. So that is where we are engaged with the government,"" Akshaya Moondra, CEO of Vodafone Idea said during the June quarter earnings call, expressing confidence of a solution to the AGR issue. Vodafone Idea has been keen on continuing the capex, which has been going on since last year, and is looking at non-banking sources of funding too. ""In the past, we have always seen that government has been supportive. You look at 2019 deferment of spectrum instalments, 2021 Reforms Package, 2023 conversion of government dues to equity, 2025 again, conversion of government dues to equity. Generally, these actions have happened,"" Akshaya Moondra said in August, adding, ""Our request to the government has been that let us resolve this earlier than before the deadline of March, so that banks get clarity and we can proceed with bank funding."" Shares of Vodafone Idea are higher by 25 percent over the last one month and are trading flat on YTD basis.","The telecom firm had moved the Supreme Court seeking to quash the additional demand of AGR dues worth Rs 9,450 crore by the DoT, and argued that the demand exceeds the scope of the Court’s earlier ruling on AGR liabilities.","The telecom firm had moved the Supreme Court seeking to quash the additional demand of AGR dues worth Rs 9,450 crore by the DoT, and argued that the demand exceeds the scope of the Court’s earlier ruling on AGR liabilities.","Vodafone Idea has contested the calculation, claiming that certain amounts have been added twice and need reconciliation.","The telecom firm had moved the Supreme Court seeking to quash the additional demand of AGR dues worth Rs 9,450 crore by the DoT, and argued that the demand exceeds the scope of the Court’s earlier ruling on AGR liabilities.",negative,0.7716969847679138

Anil Kumar Chaudhary had resigned on September 08, 2025 with immediate effect, and the company informed the exchanges about the development the next day, with the resignation letter citing the reason shared in a filing on September 14. The director cited 'certain issues' that have persisted despite efforts to address them, which have posed 'professional and ethical dilemmas'. ""...I am no longer able to meaningfully contribute to the Board's functioning in the manner envisioned under the regulatory framework for independent directors,"" Anil Kumar Chaudhary said in his resignation letter. He also cited some concerns around governance of the board, which have likely unsettled investors in the shares of the company, leading the sharp selloff. ""I believe that effective governance and truly independent oversight are essential ingredients for safeguarding stakeholder interests and I find the prevailing dynamics of the Board to be inconsistent with these principles,"" he added. One of the grave charges mentioned in the resignation letter by Chaudhary has alleged that dissent on the board of KRBL is 'suppressed or sidelined'. ""In such an operating environment where dissent is suppressed or sidelined, remaining on the Board would compromise both my professional ethics and obligations as defined under Indian corporate governance codes,"" Chaudhary said. The director cited 'certain issues' that have persisted despite efforts to address them, which have posed 'professional and ethical dilemmas'. Citing specifics, Anil Kumar Chaudhary said there have been 'inconsistencies' in the recording of minutes of board and committee meetings, and there have been 'instances of information being withheld', which he said has impacted informed decision-making. Some concerns were also cited relating to the financials of the company, wherein 'unjust write-off' of certain export receivables were carried out without adequate deliberation. The outgoing director also raised concerns around the use of CSR funds. There has also been 'arbitrary distribution' of Variable Pay and Annual Increments to persons holding office or profit, the director said. Citing another instance, Anil Kumar Chaudhary said, 'significant changes' to the object clause was undertaken 'without comprehensive discussion', and there has been 'undue interference' by invitees during board meetings. There has been no comment so far by the company on the accusations by the outgoing director against the company. Despite the sharp selloff, shares of KRBL have been higher by over 32 percent so far this year.

Eternal now among top 10 most-valued stocks in MF kitty,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/eternal-now-among-top-10-most-valued-stocks-in-mf-kitty-13545685.html,"Eternal Ltd, formerly known as Zomato, has made its way into the list of the 10 most-owned stocks by mutual funds, overtaking established giants such as ITC, Maruti Suzuki India and Sun Pharmaceuticals. The milestone comes despite Eternal being the costliest stock in the Nifty index, with a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 950 times. As of August end, 43 mutual funds hold shares of Eternal, with a combined holding valued at Rs 71,746 crore. In comparison, HDFC Bank remains the top mutual fund holding, with 45 funds together owning shares worth Rs 3.13 lakh crore, followed by ICICI Bank (46 funds, Rs 2.47 lakh crore) and Reliance Industries Ltd (45 funds, Rs 1.75 lakh crore). Other major holdings during the month include Infosys (45 funds, Rs 1.25 lakh crore), Bharti Airtel (Rs 1.22 lakh crore), State Bank of India (Rs 1.05 lakh crore), Larsen & Toubro (Rs 1.01 lakh crore) and Kotak Mahindra Bank (Rs 77,242 crore). Eternal has emerged as a mutual fund favourite amid a sharp rally in its stock price, which surged 108 percent in 2023, 124 percent in 2024 and has already risen over 16 percent in 2025 despite volatility in domestic equities. Analyst recommendations currently stand at 29 buy calls, zero hold and 4 sell, compared with 24 buy and 2 sell at the beginning of the year. Among the largest institutional investors, SBI Mutual Fund holds Eternal shares worth Rs 9,908 crore, followed by Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund (Rs 7,746 crore) and Motilal Oswal Mutual Fund (Rs 6,253 crore). Other significant positions are held by HDFC Mutual Fund (Rs 5,218 crore), UTI Mutual Fund (Rs 5,200 crore), Nippon India Mutual Fund (Rs 5,100 crore), ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund (Rs 5,099 crore), Axis Mutual Fund (Rs 4,987 crore), Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund (Rs 3,416 crore), Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund (Rs 2,807 crore) and Canara Robeco Mutual Fund (Rs 2,617 crore). Mutual funds’ confidence in Eternal remains strong, as analysts project its core food delivery business to deliver margin expansion and robust free cash flow over the next three years, aided by lower capital expenditure and improved working capital efficiency. These gains are expected to bankroll the company’s quick commerce operations, which are projected to turn EBITDA profitable by the fourth quarter of FY26. Revenue growth is forecast at 42 percent, with Eternal already profitable at the PAT level. At the same time, the quick commerce market is heating up, with Amazon joining Flipkart and Reliance in taking on incumbents Blinkit, Instamart and Zepto. Experts highlight that Blinkit is scaling aggressively, with a larger store network and customer base, and enjoys stronger unit economics that translate into superior EBITDA margins compared to peers. Backed by cash reserves of Rs 18,860 crore, Eternal is well placed to step up marketing and expand its dark store footprint.","As of August end, 43 mutual funds hold shares of Eternal, with a combined holding valued at Rs 71,746 crore.","Other significant positions are held by HDFC Mutual Fund (Rs 5,218 crore), UTI Mutual Fund (Rs 5,200 crore), Nippon India Mutual Fund (Rs 5,100 crore), ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund (Rs 5,099 crore), Axis Mutual Fund (Rs 4,987 crore), Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund (Rs 3,416 crore), Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund (Rs 2,807 crore) and Canara Robeco Mutual Fund (Rs 2,617 crore).","Backed by cash reserves of Rs 18,860 crore, Eternal is well placed to step up marketing and expand its dark store footprint.","Other significant positions are held by HDFC Mutual Fund (Rs 5,218 crore), UTI Mutual Fund (Rs 5,200 crore), Nippon India Mutual Fund (Rs 5,100 crore), ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund (Rs 5,099 crore), Axis Mutual Fund (Rs 4,987 crore), Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund (Rs 3,416 crore), Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund (Rs 2,807 crore) and Canara Robeco Mutual Fund (Rs 2,617 crore).",neutral,0.9412683248519897

Dalal Street extended the winning streak for an 8th consecutive session on September 12, with Nifty 50 comfortably closing above 25,100 for the first time since July 23, powered led by auto, pharma and metals names. This also turned out to be the biggest weekly gain in nearly three months, as BSE Sesnex and Nifty gained 1.5 percent each. At close, the Sensex was up 355.97 points or 0.44 percent at 81,904.70, and the Nifty 50 was up 108.50 points or 0.43 percent at 25,114.00. Broader indices underperformed the main indices with BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices closing with marginal gains. Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Down) The GIFT Nifty is trading lower at around 25,162.50, indicating a negative opening start for the day. Asian Equities (Flat) Stocks got off to a quiet start in Asia on Monday ahead of an action-packed week that is seemingly certain to see the U.S. Federal Reserve resume its easing cycle, and perhaps leave the door wide open to a series of cuts. US Equities (Mixed) The Nasdaq notched a record high close on Friday in a mixed trading session, lifted by Microsoft as investors looked ahead to the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week, when it is widely expected to cut interest rates to counter a slowdown in the jobs market. The S&P 500 declined 0.05% to end the session at 6,584.29 points. The Nasdaq gained 0.45% to 22,141.10 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.59% to 45,834.22 points. Dollar Index (Flat) The dollar held steady on Monday ahead of a pivotal week filled with central bank decisions led by the Federal Reserve, while the euro hardly reacted to Fitch's downgrade of France's credit rating. Asian currencies (Mixed) Some of the Asian currencies were not trading today, while other currencies were trading mixed with Philippines Peso, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollar were trading lower and South Korean Won, Japanese Yen, Singapore Dollar were trading with marginal gains. Crude (Gains) Oil prices were little changed on Monday as investors assessed the impact of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries that could disrupt its crude and fuel exports, while also eyeing U.S. fuel-demand growth. Gold (down) Gold held near a record as traders geared up for an anticipated easing of the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy this week and looked for clues on further rate cuts this year. Fund Flow Action The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) broke two-day selling streak and bought equities worth Rs 129 crore on September 12, while Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) continued their buying in this month, as they bought equities worth Rs 1556 crore on the same day.

For the week, Nifty50 added 373 points or 1.50 percent to end at 25,114, while the BSE Sensex index added 1193.94 points or 1.47 percent to end at 81,904.70. BSE Largecap, Midcap and Smallcap indices rose 1.5 percent each. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) extended their selling in the 11th straight week, as they offload equities worth Rs 3,577.37 crore. On the other hand, Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) continued their buying in 22nd week, as they purchased equities worth Rs 13,703.23crore. Among sectors, except Nifty Consumer Durables (down 1 percent), all other indices ended in the green with Nifty Defence index rose 7 percent, Nifty IT index jumped over 4 percent, Nifty PSU Bank index added 3 percent, while Nifty Auto, Metal, Pharma jumped 2 percent each. ""Indian markets ended the week on a strong footing, with the Nifty closing above the 25,000 level and broader indices outperforming the benchmark. The upturn was supported by optimism over the anticipation of stronger H2FY26 earnings, driven by GST rationalisation and the benefits of monetary easing, which also provide resilience to valuations. Sentiment was further lifted by reports that the EU may reject U.S. tariff proposals on India’s Russian oil imports,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""Continued foreign outflows weighed on the rupee, while gold reached fresh highs on strong safe-haven demand amid global trade tensions. The market, however, found support in improving prospects for India–US trade negotiations, suggesting tariff-related risks may prove short-lived. Although global bond yields have risen to new peaks, investors currently do not view them as a major threat."" ""The IT index exhibited its rally, driven by renewed hopes of a Fed rate cut, Infosys’ buyback announcement, and optimism over a revival in technology spending. Consumer-centric sectors, particularly Auto, displayed steady resilience, supported by expectations of GST-driven demand recovery and festive season tailwinds. Domestic CPI inflation registered a slight uptick; however, ongoing tax reforms are expected to help ease pressures in the period ahead,"" he added The BSE Small-cap index rose 1.5 percent with Sigachi Industries, Faze Three, Precision Camshafts, SMS Pharmaceuticals, Themis Medicare, Indo Count Industries, MTAR Technologies, IOL Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals, Prime Focus, New Delhi Television, India Tourism Development Corporation, Swelect Energy Systems, Greenpanel Industries, Dilip Buildcon, Garware Hi-Tech Films, JBM Auto, Ramco Industries, Salasar Techno Engineering rising 15-36 percent. On the other hand, KR Rail Enginerring, Paradeep Phosphates, Good Luck India, Reliance Infrastructure, Vimta Labs, Rishabh Instruments, CarTrade Tech fell between 10-16 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Osho Krishan, Sr. Analyst – Technical & Derivatives, Angel One On the levels front, the intermediate support level is anticipated to reside within the 25000-24900 range, which is expected to provide a buffer against potential declines. Furthermore, the positive crossover of the 20 and 50 DEMA around 24800 is regarded as a critical support zone from a positional perspective. At the higher end, intermediate resistance levels are identified around 25250, followed by a bearish gap located in the 25340 zone. Nevertheless, given the current technical configuration, the range of 25500 to 25600 appears to be attainable in the near term. Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research, Kotak Securities We believe that as long as the market is trading above 25,000/81800, the bullish sentiment is likely to continue. On the higher side, 25,150–25,200/82200-82400 would act as immediate resistance zones for the bulls. A successful breakout above 25,200/82400 could push the market up toward 25,500–25,550/83300-83500. On the flip side, below 25,000/81800, the uptrend could become vulnerable. Traders may consider exiting their long positions if the market falls below this level. For Bank Nifty, the 20-day SMA and the level of 54,300 could act as key support zones. Above these levels, the pullback move could continue toward 55,300–55,500 or the 50-day SMA. Conversely, if the index falls below 54,300, it could retest levels around 54,000–53,700.
