"US stocks fall, as investors fret over Trump's Fed nominee, earnings, inflation",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/us-stocks-fall-as-investors-fret-over-trump-s-fed-nominee-earnings-inflation-13801152.html,"Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on Friday as investors viewed President Donald Trump's nomination of former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh as a hawkish choice to succeed Federal Reserve Chair ​Jerome Powell, while also digesting earnings reports and a high inflation reading. On top of assessing the risks from U.S. tensions with countries including Iran, investors were also worried about ‌the prospect of another U.S. government shutdown after new barriers emerged in the Senate to a deal that would ensure continuation of funding for agency operations. At the Fed, Warsh, 55, is expected to favor lower interest rates but stop short of the more aggressive monetary easing linked to some other potential nominees. With Powell's term ending in May, Warsh, if confirmed by the Senate, would take the helm of a central bank he has argued should scale back its role in the economy and rethink its approach to monetary policy. ""Markets are calibrating to Trump's pick of Kevin Warsh ... and the outlook for monetary policy,"" said Michael Hans, chief investment officer at ‌Citizens Wealth, who also pointed to an unwinding of recent trading patterns with the U.S. dollar gaining ground on Friday and precious metals selling off sharply. Meanwhile, ​in earnings, Apple shares regained ground to close up 0.4% after earlier losses a day after the iPhone maker released quarterly results. On the data front, producer prices increased more than expected in December, suggesting inflation could pick up in the months ahead. ""There's a combination of investor concerns around the Fed chair announcement, some mixed tech earnings and lingering inflation pressure as well as some uncertainty about a potential government ‍shutdown even though it should be short-lived,"" said Angelo Kourkafas, senior global strategist at Edward Jones. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 179.09 points, or 0.36%, to 48,892.47, the S&P 500 lost 29.98 points, or 0.43%, to 6,939.03 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 223.30 points, or 0.94%, to 23,461.82. The rate-sensitive, small-cap Russell 2000 index has recently been outperforming large-cap indexes but on Friday it lagged with a 1.6% loss for the day. But the Russell 2000 ended the month up ⁠more than 5%, compared with monthly advances of 1.4% for the S&P 500 and 0.9% for the Nasdaq. The Dow, meanwhile, climbed 1.7% for January, to notch a ninth consecutive monthly advance, its longest ‍winning streak since 2018. For the week, the S&P 500 rose 0.3%, the Dow fell 0.4% and the Nasdaq fell 0.2%. The S&P's Materials index led declines among the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors, with a 1.9% loss, ‌as U.S.-listed gold ‌and silver miners tumbled in sympathy with the massive selloff in gold prices and in silver. Defensive consumer staples was the sector with the biggest advance on the day, rising 1.4%. Colgate-Palmolive (CL.N), opens new tab was its biggest gainer, closing up 5.9%, after the maker of toothpaste and soap forecast annual sales above Wall Street estimates on steady demand for household staples in markets such as Latin America and Europe. Investors have given a mixed reception to megacap earnings reports this week with a stark warning that record capital‑spending binges will be tolerated as long as the growth keeps coming. Apple wrapped up the week with a forecast of higher-than-expected revenue growth of ⁠up to 16% for the March quarter, but ⁠warned that rising memory-chip prices had started ​to pressure profitability. Microsoft ended down 0.7% on Friday after falling 10% on Thursday for its deepest daily loss since March 2020 after its cloud revenue failed to impress. Meta shares closed 3% lower on Friday. After falling on Thursday following its results, Tesla shares rose 3.3% on Friday, providing the S&P 500 with its biggest boost, after reports that SpaceX is exploring deals with the electric-vehicle maker and other companies run by Elon Musk. Verizon Communications was the ‍S&P 500's second-biggest boost, finishing up 11.8% after it forecast annual profit and free cash flow above market expectations on Friday, after aggressive promotions during the peak holiday period fueled its highest quarterly wireless subscriber additions in six years. SanDisk shares rallied 6.9% after a better-than-expected third-quarter forecast as AI fuels storage demand. But KLA Corp shares tumbled 15.2% even after the company beat Wall Street expectations for second-quarter profit and revenue. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.59-to-1 ratio on the NYSE ​where there were 247 new highs and 154 new lows. On the Nasdaq, 1,599 stocks rose and 3,222 fell as ‍declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.02-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 19 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 72 new highs and 205 new lows. On U.S. exchanges, 23.88 billion shares changed hands compared with the 19.42 ​billion moving average for the last 20 trading sessions.","But the Russell 2000 ended the month up ⁠more than 5%, compared with monthly advances of 1.4% for the S&P 500 and 0.9% for the Nasdaq.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 179.09 points, or 0.36%, to 48,892.47, the S&P 500 lost 29.98 points, or 0.43%, to 6,939.03 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 223.30 points, or 0.94%, to 23,461.82.","""Markets are calibrating to Trump's pick of Kevin Warsh ... and the outlook for monetary policy,"" said Michael Hans, chief investment officer at ‌Citizens Wealth, who also pointed to an unwinding of recent trading patterns with the U.S. dollar gaining ground on Friday and precious metals selling off sharply.","But the Russell 2000 ended the month up ⁠more than 5%, compared with monthly advances of 1.4% for the S&P 500 and 0.9% for the Nasdaq.",positive,0.9418748617172241

The BSE midcap and the small cap indices outperformed the larger peers. BSE Metals (commodity rally), capital goods (budget expectation) and Oil & Gas (rise in oil price) were the major gainers in this week, whereas BSE Auto index (reacted to India EU FTA) witnessed correction. The INR (vs USD) that has been weakening in recent weeks, hit fresh record lows this week. Oil prices have been climbing sharply in this week — with Brent crude and WTI hitting multi-month highs on rising geopolitical risk. From India’s perspective, sharp increase in oil prices can fuel inflation, put pressure on currency and widen the current account deficit.

FII continues to sell Indian equities with net selling in cash market in Jan 2026 (till date) crossing Rs 40,000 crore. Global equity markets priced in weakening of the Dollar index, the US Fed keeping policy rates unchanged, increased geopolitical tensions, and a sharp increase in gold and silver prices. In the coming week, Union Budget, commodity price movement, geo-political developments, currency movements, Q3FY26 results & management commentary and FII activity will influence the Indian equity market. Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities Nifty opened on a weak note and spent most of the session in a narrow, sideways range. The index found strong intraday support twice in the 25220–25210 zone and staged a smart recovery towards the last hour. However, it closed the day at 25,321, down 0.39% for the day. After bouncing off its 200-day EMA in the previous session, Nifty failed to see meaningful follow-through and ended the day trading inside the prior day’s range. Going ahead, the immediate resistance for Nifty is placed in the 25,450–25,500 zone, with the Index failing to decisively close above this zone after attempting twice in the last six sessions. A decisive breakout above this zone could result in Nifty extending its pullback towards 25,650, followed by 25,800 in the near term. On the downside, the 200-day EMA zone of 25,200–25,150 zone is likely to act as a strong support.

The Nifty India Defence Index rose over 1.5 percent to an intraday high of 8,193.50. The index is up 8.9 percent so far this week, marking its strongest weekly rise since May 2025, when India-Pakistan border tensions had flared. The rally comes ahead of the Union Budget, with analysts expecting a substantial increase in defence capital spending. Om Ghawalkar, Market Analyst, Share.Market (PhonePe Wealth), noted ""the Nifty India Defence Index is flashing strong bullish signals as it prepares for a major breakout from a Double Bottom pattern. Currently trading at 8,184, the index has gained 8% this week, significantly outperforming the broader market. This momentum is supported by a Golden Crossover, where the 10-day and 21-day moving averages have climbed above the medium-term trend, confirming a new uptrend. With a rising MACD and prices holding well above all key moving averages, the technical setup suggests that buyers are firmly in control."" ""The index's strength is further highlighted by its position relative to long-term trend lines. It is currently trading comfortably above its 50-day SMA and its 200-day SMA, which indicates a robust primary trend. The recent ""Golden Crossover"" specifically saw the short-term averages move past the 100-day SMA, providing a clear technical ""buy"" signal for momentum traders looking at the medium-term horizon. Looking ahead, the index faces immediate hurdles at 8,350 and 8,450. A clean break above these resistance levels could trigger a fresh rally toward previous record highs. On the downside, the 7,300–7,400 zone provides a solid support floor, protecting against sudden volatility. As the Union Budget 2026 approaches on February 1, this pre-budget momentum highlights the sector's strength and its role as a key growth theme for investors in the current market. Hemant Sood, Managing Director, Findoc, said ""The sharp rally in defence stocks reflects strong investor expectations of a higher defence allocation in the upcoming Union Budget, driven largely by evolving global geopolitical tensions and rising security concerns. With ongoing international conflicts, markets are factoring in increased focus on defence preparedness and modernization."" ""Within the sector, aerial combat technologies and drone manufacturing are likely to remain key beneficiaries, as next-generation warfare increasingly relies on surveillance, automation, and advanced combat systems. Additionally, defence PSU stocks are expected to stay in focus, given their direct linkage to government spending and execution. From a valuation standpoint, defence stocks are not excessively stretched, which further supports the ongoing momentum. Overall, a favourable budgetary push, combined with strategic importance and reasonable valuations, is driving sustained investor interest in the defence space,"" he added. According to Emkay Research, recent geopolitical developments leave the government with limited flexibility, necessitating higher defence outlays. The brokerage has forecast a 12–13 percent year-on-year growth in defence spending over the next three to four years. Nuvama Institutional Equities also expects the Budget to accelerate spending in the sector. Macquarie said India could raise defence expenditure to 2.5 percent of GDP by fiscal 2027 from 1.9 percent in the current fiscal, with a sharper focus on indigenisation. The defence index has gained 5.15 percent so far in January, compared with a 3.3 percent decline in the benchmark Nifty 50. The Nifty India Defence Index had fallen 1.2 percent in the previous session but recovered those losses on Friday. All its 18 constituents were trading in the green. Dynamatic Technologies emerged as the top gainer, rising 8 percent to Rs 8,790 per share. Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers and MTAR Technologies followed, advancing 7.37 percent and 7.19 percent, respectively. MTAR Technologies reported a strong performance in the December quarter, supported by healthy execution across segments and operating leverage. The company’s net profit more than doubled to Rs 34.6 crore in the third quarter of FY26 from Rs 15.9 crore a year ago, while revenue rose 56.9 percent year-on-year to Rs 273.7 crore. EBITDA jumped 80.7 percent to Rs 59.8 crore, with operating margin improving to 22 percent from 19 percent in the corresponding quarter last year. ""GRSE is mirroring the Nifty Defence Index’s bullish structure, currently trading at ₹2,764. Technically, the stock is primed for an uptrend as it forms a Double Bottom pattern with strong volume accumulation. While ₹2,100 serves as a solid support floor, the stock faces its next major test at the ₹3,000 psychological resistance level. MTAR Technologies is witnessing a powerful technical breakout, surging past the critical Rs 2,700 resistance to reach Rs 2,931. This move is validated by a massive volume spike and a bullish MACD crossover, signaling that the stock has shifted from consolidation to an aggressive growth phase. Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders is showing early signs of a bullish reversal as it successfully closed above its 50-day moving average this week,"" added Ghawalkar. Shares of Paras Defence and Space Technologies, Cochin Shipyard, Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, Bharat Electronics and Hindustan Aeronautics also gained up to 3 percent.

"Government sets minimum import price for penicillin, salts; Aurobindo Pharma stock up",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/government-sets-minimum-import-price-for-penicillin-salts-aurobindo-pharma-stock-up-13799687.html,"The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) has set a minimum import price (MIP) for penicillin and its salts, which are critical antibiotic raw material, for a year to curb dumping, especially from China. MIP is a government-mandated, temporary floor price below which specific foreign goods cannot be imported, designed to protect domestic industries from cheap, predatory or dumped imports. Through MIP, the government wants to protect the fledgling domestic fermentation industry from a surge of low-cost Chinese imports for critical antibiotic raw materials. The move is a major win for Aurobindo Pharma, providing the necessary pricing floor to make its Rs 3,500-crore (approximately $420 million) investment under the government’s Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme viable. At 1.18 pm, the Aurobindo Pharma share was trading at Rs 1187.10 on the National Stock Exchange, up 3.17 percent from the previous close. Aurobindo, which has built a massive facility to manufacture penicillin, 6-APA, and amoxicillin trihydrate, the policy provides a critical shield against international price undercutting that had threatened to stall its operations. Price protection shield Penicillin-G (Pen-G) will be have MIP of Rs 2,216 a kg (approximately $26.50 per kg); 6-APA Rs.3, 405 (around $40.80) and amoxicillin trihydrate Rs 2,733 a kg ($32.70), the government said in a notification on January 29. International price for Pen-G had fallen to $13.5 a kg by late 2025, far below the $25 level analysts estimate is required for domestic production to remain profitable, forcing the government to step in. Domestic players were being forced to calibrate production to minimal levels despite having the capacity to meet national demand. Countering predatory imports For decades, India has been almost entirely dependent on China for fermentation-based inputs, leaving its primary healthcare system vulnerable to supply chain shocks. MIP is designed to neutralise predatory pricing rather than act as a permanent trade barrier. The restrictions do not apply to export-oriented units (EOUs) or imports used for re-export under the Advance Authorisation scheme. Expanding the playbook: Clavulanic Acid The Pen-G decision follows a similar protective measure for potassium clavulanate (KGA), a critical component in widely used combination antibiotics. The government set an MIP of $180 a kg, effective until November 2026, to support Kinvan Pvt Ltd., the first Indian firm to produce the ingredient domestically. Kinvan, which plans to scale up to 300 metric tons annually, saw prices crash from $195 to $150 shortly after its project was launched, a volatility the MIP is intended to curb. While some import-reliant firms have raised concerns about potential cost increases, government officials said most penicillin-based medicines are already under price control, meaning any incremental cost impact at the consumer level should remain marginal.","MIP is a government-mandated, temporary floor price below which specific foreign goods cannot be imported, designed to protect domestic industries from cheap, predatory or dumped imports.","Price protection shield Penicillin-G (Pen-G) will be have MIP of Rs 2,216 a kg (approximately $26.50 per kg); 6-APA Rs.3, 405 (around $40.80) and amoxicillin trihydrate Rs 2,733 a kg ($32.70), the government said in a notification on January 29.

The shares of the CV-maker plunged to Rs 450.55 apiece on Friday, snapping a two-session gaining streak. Tata Motors Q3 Results: Tata Motors on January 29 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 705 crore for the third quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a 48 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall from the Rs 1,355 crore net profit reported in the same period last year. The earnings however were impacted by some exceptional losses. The firm incurred a one-time cost of Rs 962 crore to account for the stamp duty charges payable to various local authorities to effect transfer of registration of land acquired as part of the its demerger scheme. Additionally, the company also incurred a one-time cost of Rs 603 crore due to the implementation of the new labour codes, which took effect last year, along with Rs 82 crore for acquisition. Overall, the company incurred exceptional costs worth Rs 1,643 crore during the quarter. The CV-maker’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose more than 16 percent YoY to Rs 21,847 crore during the quarter under review. Operating margin improved to 12.60 percent in Q3 FY26 from 12.07 percent in Q3 FY25, while profit margin reduced to 3.23 percent. Tata Motors reported a 30 bps increase in consolidated EBITDA to 12.5 percent during the October-December quarter of the ongoing FY26. Motilal Oswal on Tata Motors: Motilal Oswal said that the firm’s Q3 results missed estimates, led by input cost pressures. The automaker’s Q3 profit was below the domestic brokerage’s expectations due to lower-than-expected margin at 12.8 percent. “The key concern for TMCV has been its gradual loss of market share across key segments. Further, its recent acquisition of Iveco would expose it to the ongoing global macro uncertainties, thereby driving a potential de-rating, if demand does not improve anytime soon. We have already factored in a pickup in domestic CV demand in our estimates (we estimate 9% volume CAGR over FY25-28E). We also factor in margins to remain stable at 13% over FY25-28E,” Motilal said. However, the brokerage added that the stock appears to be fairly valued now after a recent rally. It remained ‘Neutral’ on the stock, with a target price of Rs 431 apiece, which implies an upside potential of more than 8 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. Emkay Global on Tata Motors: Emkay Global said that the firm’s net profit beat its estimate mainly on account of lower-than-expected tax expense. “We believe the overall CV demand environment remains constructive, with double-digit growth likely to sustain till H1FY27 – TMCV should lead this multi-year upcycle in our view,” it said. The firm retained its ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 650 apiece, which implies an upside potential of more than 38 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. JM Financial on Tata Motors: JM Financial said that rising commodity prices are expected to have impact on margins in Q4 FY26. “To partly offset this, the company has implemented a 1% price hike effective 1st Jan’26, while a potential moderation in discount intensity could provide additional support to the margins,” it said. The brokerage kept a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 550 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 17 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.

Shares of Manappuram Finance slipped over 9 percent to an intraday low of Rs 270 per share on the NSE. The company had reported a 14.5 percent year-on-year decline in consolidated net profit at Rs 241 crore for the December quarter, impacted by a slowdown in its microfinance segment. Global brokerage Jefferies, which has a ‘Hold’ rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 285, said lower net interest margins and higher provisions led to the earnings miss, even as gold loan growth remained strong and management undertook measures to strengthen the franchise. PhillipCapital upgraded Manappuram Finance to ‘Neutral’ from ‘Sell’ with a price target of Rs 260, citing improving gold loan momentum and management-led restructuring. The brokerage noted that higher costs and stress in the microfinance business weighed on quarterly profit. The stock has gained around 64 percent so far in 2025, while it is down about 3.8 percent in January. Meanwhile, shares of Muthoot Finance fell over 7 percent to Rs 3,924 on the NSE.

""After hitting record highs, gold and silver prices dropped as a rebound in the US dollar triggered aggressive profit-taking,"" said Manav Modi, Commodities Analyst at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. He said domestic prices declined more than international benchmarks in the previous session, raising price parity concerns. The dollar index rebounded from recent lows of 96, while the USD/INR pair touched a record high. According to Modi, elevated prices had already dampened physical demand. He added that the World Gold Council noted a moderation in central bank purchases in the fourth quarter of 2025, although strong investor inflows offset the slowdown. The council has also indicated that India’s gold imports may decline this year as record prices weigh on jewellery demand.

Paytm Q3 Results: Paytm on January 29 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 225 crore for Q3 FY26, as against a net loss of Rs 208 crore for Q3 FY25. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile grew more than 20 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 2,194 crore during the quarter under review, as against Rs 1,828 crore in the year-ago period, led by higher payments GMV, merchant subscriptions, and distribution of financial services revenue. EBITDA grew to Rs 156 crore, with EBITDA margin at 7 percent, despite higher promotional expenses for consumer growth and full impact of new labour code, the company said. It reported consistent gain in UPI consumer market share for 3 consecutive quarters, with Paytm’s consumer UPI GMV rising 35 percent in last nine months, as against industry GMV growth of 16 percent during the same period. Brokerages on Paytm: Citi maintained its 'Buy' rating on the stock, but cut its target price to Rs 1,375 apiece from 1,500 apiece. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 18 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 1,168.1 apiece.

Th stock had earlier seen a sharp decline amid concerns around Payment Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) that was extended until December 2025. The initiative by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) aimed to encourage deployment of digital payments acceptance infrastructure like soundboxes and POS devices, through incentives. Notably there has been no update yet as to whether the scheme will be extended beyond 2025. After the shares saw strong volatility following the reports, Paytm issued a clarification. It said that it received Rs 128 crore as incentive under the scheme for the six months ended September 30, 2025. ""In the scenario that the current Scheme is not extended or replaced, we expect to significantly offset the impact over time through a combination of higher revenues and more targeted sales efforts,"" it added. CLSA kept an 'Underperform' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,000 apiece. This marks a 14 percent downside potential from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 1,168.1 apiece. The international brokerage said that the firm’s Q3 results were in line with estimates. However, it cut profit before tax estimates by 3-5 percent due to loss of PIDF income, which was partly offset by lower ad spend. Jefferies kept a 'Buy' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,450 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 24 percent over the stock’s previous closing price.

The decline came after three consecutive sessions of gains. Brokerage reactions to the quarterly performance were mixed. CLSA downgraded Swiggy to ‘Hold’ and cut its price target to Rs 335 after the company missed its revenue and Ebitda estimates for the third quarter. The brokerage said that while the food delivery business reported better growth in gross order value and revenues, with Ebitda broadly in line, the quick commerce segment disappointed across key metrics, reflecting slower growth and weaker profitability.

Ebitda losses at Instamart, the company’s quick commerce unit and its largest revenue generator, widened sequentially during the quarter, even as contribution and Ebitda margins showed some improvement. At the consolidated level, Swiggy reported a narrower sequential loss and reaffirmed its outlook for contribution margin breakeven by the first quarter of FY27. Jefferies said there remain several unanswered questions around the profitability trajectory of the quick commerce business and raised its estimates for Instamart’s losses going forward. Elara Capital described the third-quarter performance as a “mixed bag” but said it expects a sharper focus on profitability in the quick commerce segment, as management reiterated its contribution margin breakeven guidance. The stock is down 20.5 percent so far this year.

"Vedanta shares snap 6-day gains, fall 8% despite strong Q3 results on global decline in metal prices",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vedanta-shares-snap-6-day-gains-fall-6-despite-strong-q3-results-on-global-decline-in-metal-prices-13799308.html,"The shares of metals-to-oil conglomerate Vedanta dropped more than 8 percent on January 30 after the company released its results for the third quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. Brokerages have mixed views for the stock. The shares of the company dropped to Rs 702.4 apiece in the morning trading hours of Friday to snap a six-session gaining streak. This comes a day after the stock hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 769.80 apiece. Notably, today’s sharp fall in Vedanta’s share price also comes amid a broader downturn in metal stocks, buoyed by profit booking, falling metal prices and speculation of a hawkish Federal Reserve Governor. The Nifty Metal index tumbled nearly 5 percent today. Vedanta Q3 Results: Vedanta on January 29 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 5,710 crore for the October-December quarter of FY26, marking a 61 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump from the Rs 3,547 crore net profit reported in the same period of the previous financial year. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose 37 percent YoY to Rs 23,369 crore during the quarter under review. “Q3 FY26 has been a landmark quarter for Vedanta, delivering our highest-ever EBITDA of ₹15,171 crore, with two of our businesses achieving their best-ever financial results. Aluminium posted its strongest EBITDA margin of $1,268 per ton, supported by record alumina and aluminium production. Zinc India recorded its highest-ever quarterly EBITDA of ₹6,064 crore, driven by record mined and refined metal output, with silver contributing 44% of overall profit. Zinc International also reported a 28% YoY increase in production, led by Gamsberg achieving its highest-ever recovery,” said Arun Misra, Executive Director, Vedanta. “Our Oil & Gas business reached a major milestone with India’s first subsea template installation, while our Thermal Power Business delivered 188% YoY EBITDA growth with a 62% increase in sales volumes. Steel and Ferrochrome Business also achieved record production of steel billets at 285 kt, and ferrochrome output up 32% YoY,” he added. Brokerages on Vedanta: ICICI Direct Research said that Vedanta’s overall performance for the quarter was aided by higher aluminium, zinc and silver prices, but any cool-off in non-ferrous metal prices and silver could potentially led to stock price decline. Motilal Oswal Financial Services kept a ‘Neutral’ rating on the shares of Vedanta, with a target price of Rs 810 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 6 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 766.35 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that Vedanta’s Q3 operational performance came largely as expected, supported by better volumes and favorable LME prices. “Capex plans are progressing well and will likely lead to further cost savings. Management targets to maintain strong growth in earnings, led by the upcoming capacity, which will produce higher VAP products. VEDL remains firm on its deleveraging plans, and going forward, higher cash flows will support both its expansion plans and deleveraging efforts,” it added. The stock currently trades at 7x EV/EBITDA and 4.4x P/BV on the FY27 estimate, Motilal said. Emkay Global kept a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, and increased its target price over 21 percent to Rs 850 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that the firm’s strong Q3 results were driven by higher aluminium and zinc profitability. “We continue to believe that if there was ever a better time in the past decade to own exposure to industrial metals, it is now,” it added.

This comes amid profit booking after a sharp gaining streak, and decline in commodity prices. The Nifty Metal index tumbled 5.21 percent to 11,827.55 on Friday, snapping a three-day gaining streak during which it gained nearly 9 percent. The sectoral index closed as the top loser on the market today. Why are metal stocks falling today? The fall in metal stocks may have been partially driven by profit booking after the rally. Additionally, metal prices significantly declined today. Gold and silver futures crashed up to 15 percent on the MCX, while copper and aluminium futures fell around 5 and 7 percent respectively. The sharp fall in global metal prices comes amid speculations that the US Federal Reserve may get a more hawkish chair. US President Donald Trump said he intends to announce his pick to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday, as speculation intensifies over who will lead the American central bank after Jerome Powell steps aside in May. ""So, a potentially less dovish Fed Chairman pick, a rebound in the dollar and gold giving way to overbought conditions have contributed to the decline in the price of the precious metal,"" Reuters quoted KCM Chief Trade Analyst Tim Waterer as saying. Top metal losers today: Hindustan Zinc shares were the top loser on the index, falling around 12.5 percent to close at Rs 626 apiece. Vedanta and Hindustan Copper shares fell around 11 percent each. Notably, this comes a day after Hindustan Copper shares jumped 20 percent to hit a fresh lifetime high of Rs 760.05 apiece. Vedanta released its results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026.

Among the silver ETFs, Axis Silver ETF crashed 24 percent, while ICICI Prudential Silver and Kotak Silver ETF fell nearly 23 percent. SBI Silver ETF and others fell more than 22 percent each. Mirae Asset Silver ETF, Motilal Oswal Silver ETF, HDFC Silver ETF and Nippon India Silver ETF also plunged sharply. Why are gold and silver prices crashing today? The sharp fall in global prices of the precious metals comes amid speculations that the US Federal Reserve may get a more hawkish chair. Spot gold fell 5 percent on Friday, a day after hitting a record high of $5,594.82. US President Donald Trump said he intends to announce his pick to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday, as speculation intensifies over who will lead the American central bank after Jerome Powell steps aside in May. ""So, a potentially less dovish Fed Chairman pick, a rebound in the dollar and gold giving way to overbought conditions have contributed to the decline in the price of the precious metal,"" Reuters quoted KCM Chief Trade Analyst Tim Waterer as saying. ""Rumours that Kevin Warsh will replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair has weighed on gold during Asian trade,"" said Matt Simpson, a senior analyst at StoneX, as quoted by the report. What should you do? The market is divided between those viewing corrections as buying opportunities and those warning of overheated conditions, said Tanvi Kanchan, Associate Director at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers. She however added that despite price swings, fundamentals are compelling, driven by near-record industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles, and AI infrastructure. Kanchan however cautioned that after such explosive gains in 2025, timing a single entry point is “treacherous”. “Rather than deploying capital all at once, investors should consider spreading purchases over the coming weeks or months. This approach captures the dip while protecting against further corrections that could see silver test,” she said. For conservative investors, allocating 5-10 percent of portfolios to precious metals ETFs through systematic purchases reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to an asset class that benefits from geopolitical instability and monetary policy uncertainty, according to the expert. With structural drivers such as central-bank accumulation, long-term demand and inflation hedging undiminished, disciplined investors may see this correction as a strategic accumulation zone, but should avoid aggressive short-term speculation given ongoing volatility, Khoo from VT Market said. Nirpendra Yadav, Senior Commodity Research Analyst at Bonanza, said that with global uncertainties, central bank gold accumulation, and expectations of softer real interest rates over the medium term, gold continues to play an important portfolio-hedging and diversification role.

US Equities (Mixed) The S&P 500 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq closed lower on Thursday ​as investors were rattled by the latest earnings reports and worried about whether hefty spending on artificial intelligence would pay off for mega‑cap tech companies.

Asian Currencies (Slip) Asian currencies were trading lower in the early trade on Friday with Thai Baht leading the losers followed by Japanese Yen, Malaysian Ringgit, Singapore Dollar. Crude (Down) Oil prices are headed for their biggest monthly gains in years on Friday as tensions in the Middle East escalated over a possible U.S. attack on Iran that could disrupt supplies from one of the biggest OPEC producers.

About 1,717 shares declined against 1,205 advancing shares on the NSE. The market may see range-bound trading ahead of the Union Budget scheduled on February 1. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services NTPC | CMP: Rs 358.15 NTPC consolidated in a long-term wedge since April 2025. After breaking above the wedge, it traded sideways in a rectangular range. The latest session delivered a strong breakout above this range on robust positive volume, confirming buyer conviction. The price now trades above all key EMAs with upward slopes. The RSI holds support at 50 on both daily and weekly charts, supporting continued bullish momentum. The structure remains firmly bullish while support holds. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 375 Stop-Loss: Rs 335 Ipca Laboratories | CMP: Rs 1,479.7 Ipca Laboratories broke out from a prolonged triangular consolidation (from January 2–9, 2026), gaining 13.6 percent while broader indices fell around 2.5 percent, showing clear relative strength. The breakout was backed by strong volume. The stock is now retesting the breakout zone and formed a dragonfly doji on January 21, signalling throwback exhaustion. Support has been defended for the third time. Momentum indicators remain bullish and rising. The price is trading above short-, medium-, and long-term EMAs. Repeated support defence and relative strength point to a high-probability reversal. Adding more above Rs 1,525 could propel the bullish move. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,575, Rs 1,680 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,380 NMDC | CMP: Rs 84.6 NMDC broke out above a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on December 23 from Rs 78.6, rallying to Rs 86.72 before correcting. The pullback found support at the 100-day EMA and successfully retested the breakout zone. The latest bounce formed a strong three white soldiers pattern with rising positive volume, confirming accumulation. The price trades above all key EMAs with upward slopes. Momentum indicators align bullishly, and the structure favours buyers as long as the 100-day EMA holds. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 92, Rs 98 Stop-Loss: Rs 79 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Mishra Dhatu Nigam | CMP: Rs 387.5 Mishra Dhatu Nigam has shown a sharp pickup in momentum and is now attempting to break above a long-standing downward trendline on the daily chart. The stock has moved decisively higher and is trading above its short-term moving average, indicating improving strength. Volumes have remained stable alongside the rise in price. The daily RSI is placed near 66, highlighting strengthening momentum. The DMI setup shows the positive directional line above the negative line, while the ADX remains elevated, confirming improving trend strength. As long as the stock sustains above the Rs 360 zone, the near-term outlook remains positive. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 415 Stop-Loss: Rs 370 Bharat Petroleum Corporation | CMP: Rs 366.95 BPCL has bounced back from a triple bottom pattern after a corrective phase. The stock is now holding above the previous resistance zone and is attempting to move higher from the Rs 360–365 area. It is trading above its short- and medium-term moving averages and has reclaimed the mid-Bollinger band. The daily RSI is placed near the 55 level. The rate of change indicator remains in positive territory, supporting the ongoing recovery attempt. As long as BPCL holds above the Rs 355 support area, the near-term outlook remains steady. The stock is also respecting the rising VWAP (volume-weighted average price). Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 395 Stop-Loss: Rs 352 BSE | CMP: Rs 2,861.6 BSE has maintained its post-September recovery and is currently trading within a well-defined range on the daily chart. After a sharp advance from the September lows, the stock has spent the last several weeks consolidating between the Rs 2,650 and Rs 2,950 zones, with prices now positioned in the upper half of this range. The stock continues to trade above its 20-day average near Rs 2,750, indicating that short-term support remains intact. The daily RSI is placed near 60, reflecting steady momentum. The DMI setup shows the positive directional line above the negative line, while the ADX remains low. As long as the stock holds above Rs 2,750, the broader setup remains stable, with a directional move likely only on a decisive range breakout. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,080 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,770 Hitesh Tailor, Technical Research Analyst at Choice Broking Larsen & Toubro | CMP: Rs 3,932.9 Larsen & Toubro continues to exhibit a strong bullish structure in the longer-term trend.

Post-breakout, the price retraced toward the 50-week EMA, where it found strong support and resumed its upward move, indicating healthy pullback buying and trend validation. The stock is trading comfortably above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-week EMAs, reinforcing the presence of a robust primary uptrend and positive medium-to-long-term sentiment. On the downside, Rs 3,800 acts as an important support zone, where accumulation activity is visible. The latest weekly candle has engulfed the previous range, reflecting renewed bullish dominance and improving momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,270 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,730 Indus Towers | CMP: Rs 441.55 Indus Towers has recently delivered a decisive breakout from its prolonged sideways range, signalling the beginning of a fresh bullish phase.

The stock is trading above its key 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMAs, confirming a well-established uptrend and reinforcing positive short-to-medium-term sentiment. From the recent bottom, Indus Towers is forming a higher high and higher low structure, reflecting sustained demand and trend continuation. On the downside, Rs 425 remains an important support area, where accumulation activity is clearly visible. Momentum also supports the bullish view, with the RSI placed at 61.89, holding above the midline and turning higher, suggesting strengthening upside momentum.

On the weekly chart, the stock is trading comfortably above its key 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-week EMAs, confirming a well-established primary uptrend and strengthening medium-to-long-term sentiment. On the downside, the Rs 1,320–1,340 zone emerges as an important support area, aligned with the earlier higher-high breakout region, indicating a classic role reversal from resistance to support and providing a favourable risk-reward setup. Momentum indicators further support the bullish outlook, with the RSI placed at 69.36, reflecting a strong rising trend and sustained upside momentum without immediate signs of exhaustion.

After a weak start, the market traded in a negative zone for the first half, while buying in the second half helped to regain in the losses to end near day's high. At close, the Sensex was up 221.69 points or 0.27 percent at 82,566.37, and the Nifty was up 76.15 points or 0.30 percent at 25,418.90. Among broader indices, Nifty midcap and smallcap indices ended with marginal gains. Also Read: Banks at a crossroads: Rally or selloff on Budget Day?

Click to View More Outlook for January 30 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets remained volatile but managed to edge higher amid mixed cues. After an initial downtick, the Nifty drifted lower in early trade; however, buying interest in heavyweight stocks across sectors helped pare losses and eventually pushed the index into positive territory. As a result, the benchmark settled near the 25,418 level, up by 0.30 percent. Sectoral trends were mixed, keeping participants engaged, with metals, energy and banking stocks edging higher, while FMCG, pharma and IT names remained under pressure. The broader market took a breather after two sessions of rebound and ended largely unchanged. Market sentiment stayed cautious as investors awaited key domestic events, including the Economic Survey and the upcoming Union Budget. Global uncertainty, mixed corporate earnings and continued foreign institutional selling weighed on risk appetite, while weakness in the Indian rupee added to the cautious undertone. That said, resilience in select heavyweight stocks helped limit the downside and enabled the index to sustain its recovery. The Nifty continues to hover around the long-term moving average, the 200 DEMA, with the ongoing tussle reflecting indecision at these levels. Having crossed the immediate hurdle around 25,350, the index now appears poised to inch towards the 25,600 zone. Strength in the banking index is playing a key role in the rebound, with other sectors providing support on a rotational basis. However, participants should avoid getting carried away by the recovery and remain selective, focusing on performing sectors and themes while keeping position sizes in check amid lingering geopolitical uncertainty and the approaching Union Budget. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities After initial weakness, the Nifty gained strength and closed higher. Overall, it maintained its position above the 50 EMA on the hourly chart. The RSI has remained in a positive crossover on the hourly timeframe. With Friday being the last trading session ahead of the Budget, a relatively contained movement can be expected. On the higher end, 25,500 is likely to act as a crucial resistance. On the lower end, immediate support is placed at 25,200, below which a sharp decline may be seen in the market. Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza Today, the Indian stock markets recovered strongly, after a volatile start. The Sensex ended 221 points higher at 82,566, while the Nifty 50 closed above 25,400. The recovery was driven by three key factors. First, the recently finalized India–EU FTA boosted market sentiment. Second, FIIs turned buyers after selling for 15 straight sessions, investing Rs. 480 crore in the cash market. DIIs continued to provide strong support, with inflows of Rs. 3,360 crore, helping stabilize the market. Third, the Economic Survey 2025-26 reassured investors about India’s macro strength. It projected GDP growth of 7.4% in FY26 and 7.2% in FY27, highlighted low inflation, improved bank asset quality, and continued government capital spending to support growth. Sector wise, metal stocks outperformed sharply, led by Hindustan Copper, supported by strong commodity prices and infrastructure demand expectations. In contrast, IT stocks declined, while FMCG and auto stocks saw mild profit booking. Looking ahead, markets may remain volatile until the Union Budget.

"Coal India, BCCL shares rise up to 5% as govt designates coking coal as critical mineral",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/coal-india-bccl-shares-rise-up-to-5-as-govt-designates-coking-coal-as-critical-mineral-13797237.html,"The shares of Coal India and Bharat Coking Coal sharply gained in trade on January 29 after the government designated coking coal as a 'Critical and Strategic Mineral' under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. The newly-listed shares of Bharat Coking Coal (BCCL) jumped nearly 5 percent to Rs 39 apiece in the afternoon trading hours of Thursday. Coal India shares meanwhile gained around 3 percent to Rs 456.95 apiece. Govt designates coking coal as critical mineral: The Ministry of Coal is a press statement said that the decision was taken on the basis of the recommendations of the High-Level Committee on Implementation of Viksit Bharat Goals (HLC-VB) and policy inputs from NITI Aayog, recognising the “strategic role of coking coal in ensuring mineral security and meeting the requirements of the domestic steel sector”. The ministry noted that India has approximately 37.37 billion tonnes of coking coal resources, largely located in Jharkhand, with additional reserves in Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh. “Despite this domestic availability, imports of coking coal have increased from 51.20 million tonnes in 2020–21 to 57.58 million tonnes in 2024–25. Currently, around 95 % of the coking coal requirement of the steel sector is met through imports, leading to significant foreign exchange outgo,” it added. The inclusion of coking coal in the category will likely facilitate faster approvals, improve ease of doing business and accelerate exploration and mining activities, including of deep-seated deposits, the government said. “Mining of critical minerals is exempt from public consultation requirements and permits the utilisation of degraded forest land for compensatory afforestation, measures that are also expected to encourage greater private sector participation,” it added. The amendment is expected to reduce India’s import dependence, strengthen supply-chain resilience for the steel sector, and support the objectives of the National Steel Policy, according to the ministry. What the Economic Survey said about coal: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey in the Parliament earlier today. According to the survey, coal “remains crucial” as India has the fifth-largest coal reserves and is the second-largest consumer. Coal contributes 55 percent to the national energy mix and fuels over 74 percent of total power generation, it added. The survey noted that India’s coal industry reached historic heights in FY25, producing 1,047.52 million tonnes (MT) of coal. This marked a 4.98 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase from the Rs 997.83 MT. “This represents the highest coal production the country has ever achieved, demonstrating the industry's impressive growth and importance to India's energy needs,” it added. “Driven by this strong domestic output, imports registered a significant 7.9 per cent decline, falling from 264.53 MT in FY24 to 243.62 MT in FY25.15 Furthermore, the ratio of domestic production to consumption has also steadily improved over the past decade, as production growth has consistently outpaced consumption growth,” the Economic Survey further said. Additionally, the survey noted that India’s steel industry faces critical dependence on imported Coking Coal. “To mitigate global supply risks, the Ministry of Coal launched Mission Coking Coal in 2022 with a view to significantly enhance domestic raw coking coal production to 140 MT by 2030,” it said. Coal stocks: Coal India shares hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 456.95 apiece today. The stock has gained around 8 percent in one week, and 14 percent in one month. Bharat Coking Coal shares made a stellar stock market debut on the exchanges earlier this month, listing with a premium of nearly 96 percent, following a massive subscription of 147 times between January 9-13 in the primary market. Shares of Bharat Coking Coal Ltd were listed at Rs 45 per share on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). The stock has so far declined around 13 percent since listing.

BEL shares decline up to 3% amid rich valuations despite strong Q3; profit booking pulls defence index 2% lower,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bel-shares-decline-up-to-3-amid-rich-valuations-despite-strong-q3-profit-booking-pulls-defence-index-2-lower-13796838.html,"Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) shares fell over 3 percent on Thursday amid profit booking, despite the company reporting strong December quarter results. The stock touched an intraday low of Rs 438.25. The defence PSU on Wednesday reported a 20.4 percent rise in consolidated net profit for the December quarter, while revenue from operations grew nearly 24 percent year-on-year. BEL shares have gained 36.3 per cent so far in 2025 and are up about 13 per cent in January. Brokerage firm CLSA maintained an ‘outperform’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 453, noting that third-quarter execution was better than expected. However, it said much of the optimism is already priced in, adding that near-term stock movement will depend on execution of the company’s large order backlog amid lumpy order inflows. Kotak Institutional Equities reiterated its ‘sell’ rating with a target price of Rs 390, citing limited upside after the recent rally and an unfavourable risk-reward profile at current levels. JP Morgan, which has an ‘overweight’ rating on BEL with a target price of Rs 556, said the company’s earnings beat estimates but cautioned that margins may normalise. It added that growth will hinge on operating leverage and timely execution of orders. BEL is a constituent of the benchmark Nifty 50 index. The sharp decline in the stock also weighed on other defence stocks. The Nifty Defence index, which had risen for two consecutive sessions, snapped its rally and fell up to 2 percent on Thursday amid profit booking. Defence stocks had rallied over the past two sessions after India and the European Union concluded a defence and security agreement aimed at enhancing cooperation in areas such as counter-terrorism, the Indo-Pacific and joint development of military hardware. The pact was finalised at the India-EU summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, along with European Council President Antonio Costa. Officials said the agreement is expected to improve interoperability in the defence sector and create opportunities for Indian companies under the EU’s Security Action for Europe programme.

"IT shares decline up to 3% on profit booking after 2-day rise, Persistent Systems, TCS, HCLTech lead losses; here are likely triggers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/it-shares-decline-up-to-3-on-profit-booking-after-2-day-rise-persistent-systems-tcs-hcltech-lead-losses-here-are-likely-triggers-13796653.html,"IT shares declined up to 3 percent on Thursday after two sessions of gains, as investors booked profits across the sector. Stocks such as Persistent Systems, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCL Technologies led the losses amid selling pressure. The Nifty IT index, which had risen 1.2 percent over the previous two sessions, gave up those gains and fell 1.5 percent in trade. Key factors behind the decline 1) US Federal Reserve decision: The fall came after the US Federal Reserve held interest rates, in line with expectations, citing elevated inflation and resilient economic growth. Markets are not pricing in another rate cut until the June policy meeting. Higher US interest rates tend to support the dollar and Treasury yields, making emerging markets such as India relatively less attractive for foreign investors. ""The Fed decision is likely to lead to short-term challenges in US rate-sensitive sectors. Globally, this may lead to a slight market decline as investors adjust to the expectation of no immediate rate cuts,"" said Rajesh Palviya, Head of Research at Axis Securities. The Indian IT sector, valued at about USD 283 billion, derives a significant portion of its revenue from the United States, making developments in the world’s largest economy critical for the industry. 2) Profit booking: After the recent rally, profit booking was seen across IT stocks, leading the Nifty IT index to surrender all its gains from the past two sessions. Shares of TCS declined more than 2 percent, while Persistent Systems emerged as the biggest laggard, falling up to 3 percent. Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Infosys and HCL Technologies were down up to 1 percent. All ten constituents of the Nifty IT index were trading in the red. 3) Weak US dollar: The US dollar extended its losses this week, slipping to a four-year low against a basket of currencies. A weaker dollar can weigh on Indian IT companies as it reduces the value of dollar-denominated revenues when converted into rupees, impacting earnings visibility for export-oriented firms.

"Q3 Results impact: SBI Card, SBI Life shares fall 3%; Gland Pharma surges 9% to two-month high",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/q3-results-impact-sbi-cards-sbi-life-shares-fall-3-gland-pharma-surges-9-to-two-month-high-13796631.html,"The shares of SBI Card and SBI Life dropped more than 3 percent each on January 29 after their respective Q3 results failed to impress D-Street. Gland Pharma shares meanwhile rallied more than 9 percent. The three companies had released their results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026 earlier yesterday. SBI Card Q3 Results: SBI Cards and Payment Services shares dropped 3 percent to trade at a near one-year-low of Rs 758 apiece, nearing its 52-week low of Rs 721 apiece. The stock has now snapped a two-session gaining streak. The company reported a net profit of Rs 556.64 crore for the third quarter of FY26. This marked a 45 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from the Rs 383.23 crore net profit reported in the same period of the previous financial year. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose more than 11 percent YoY to Rs 5,127.26 crore during the quarter under review. Motilal Oswal said that net interest margins fell 11 percent sequentially, as most of the benefit from the lower cost of funds has already been realized, while yields carry a mild near-term downside bias, which could keep margins under check. “We reduce our earnings estimates by 4%/6.5% for FY26/FY27, considering a contraction in margins and a decline in receivables, while credit costs are likely to witness a modest decline. We expect SBICARD to post an RoA/RoE of 3.85%/17.9% by FY27,” the domestic brokerage said. It reiterated its ‘Neutral’ rating on the stock, but revised its target price to Rs 875 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 12 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. SBI Life Q3 Results: SBI Life Insurance Company also fell more than 3 percent to trade at a one-month low of Rs 1,984.20 apiece, snapping a two-session gaining streak. SBI Life Insurance Company reported a net profit of Rs 576.74 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 5 percent YoY increase from the Rs 550.82 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. This however included a one-time exceptional item arising due to the new labour codes. Goldman Sachs maintained a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 2,385 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 16 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage noted that the firm’s VNB rose 22 percent YoY, driven by improved product mix. It however noted that margin declined by 35 bps YoY due to ITC loss. Jefferies said that improvement in APE growth is encouraging, but markets expected a slight upgrade as company's reiterated growth guidance of 13-14 percent. Gland Pharma Q3 Results: Gland Pharma shares gained more than 9 percent to trade at Rs 1,847.10 apiece, the highest level seen by the stock since November 14 last year. The company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 261.47 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 28 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase from the Rs 204.69 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. This was supported by strong sales in the key European and U.S. markets. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile grew around 22.5 percent YoY to Rs 1,695.36 crore.

"RPG Life Sciences close to acquiring 'major API asset', says MD Ashok Nair",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rpg-life-sciences-close-to-acquiring-major-api-asset-says-md-ashok-nair-13796457.html,"RPG Life Sciences is closing in on acquiring a major active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) asset, with managing director Ashok Nair telling Moneycontrol that the Mumbai-based company has shortlisted some names and has opened talks, as he laid out an aggressive medium-term roadmap. “We have shortlisted some assets… some are under the process of due diligence,” Nair said in a post-earnings interview to Moneycontrol, adding the effort has now moved beyond exploratory scanning into active negotiations. The company is willing to pay up to Rs 1,000 crore for the right API asset. “We are okay to acquire something below 1000 crore… we have a cash surplus of Rs 225 crores and the group is ready to support us,” he said, signalling a mix of internal accruals and RPG Group backing the funding route. Acquisition strategy Nair said the company is targeting niche, low‑competition API portfolios in areas such as immunosuppressants, neuropsychiatry and cardiology. It is also seeking US‑approved facilities to accelerate entry into regulated markets. “We are looking… to acquire a plant which is US approved, so we can get in an easier way rather than putting into the whole rigour process of our own,” he said. The company prefers acquisitions over greenfield projects because of speed and competitive advantage. Nair says the valuations for API assets remain elevated. “APIs are around ranging from 8.5 to 13 to 14 times EBITDA… they have not cooled off,” Nair said. Recovering from fire The company is also emerging from a disruption caused by a fire at its API plant in Navi Mumbai in January 2025. “It took some time for us to restore… almost around 60 percent of our product validation has been done,” Nair said. He expects the plant to be fully operational by March 2026 and API segment to return to its previous performance levels. “By March 26, we are back in full‑fledged position… Q4 should do well for us in API,” he said. Despite the incident, Nair said, “All the clients have been very supportive of us. None of them have moved away.” He sees the API business returning to its normal 10–12 percent growth. Domestic branded formulations play continues RPG Life Sciences’ domestic formulations business, which accounts for 70 percent of the revenue, continued its strong performance, outpacing the Indian Pharmaceutical Market. “We have continued to maintain our momentum… we are at 12.6 percent growth as compared to market of 8.8 (percent),” Nair said. Key therapies such as nephrology (+17 percent), oncology (+22 percent percent) and monoclonal antibodies (+17.4 percent) are driving the surge. Flagship brands remain on track to scale rapidly. “Naprosyn is on the path to become a Rs100 crore brand by FY27,” he said of the company’s anti-inflammatory drug used to relieve pain, fever and inflammation. Nair said the company’s volume growth has been 5.3 percent as compared to 2.1 percent for IPM. Despite 30–32 percent of the portfolio being under price control, “we still have a gross margin of 70 percent”. The company is also expanding in specialty segments such as rheumatology and nephrology, with a future push planned for dermatology, gastroenterology, cardiovascular and urology. “Going forward, we would like to enter into clinical dermatology and gastroenterology (and) also strengthen cardiovascular and urology,” Nair said. Revenue target: Rs 1,000 crore by 2028 Nair outlined an aggressive medium‑term roadmap. “We are looking to be a thousand crore company by 2028 and by 2030, we should see how we achieve around 1,500 to 2,000 crore,” he said, adding both organic and inorganic levers, especially API scale‑up, would drive the expansion. Nair said RPG Life Sciences’ normalised EBITDA margin remains healthy despite temporary drag from the API plant outage. “This year, we are at 24 percent. Last year’s 30 percent had a one‑time reversal… actually the margin was 26.5 percent,” he said, adding “24–25 is a good EBITDA margin, going forward, we should maintain that.” RPG ended FY25 with revenue of Rs.653.4 crore, growing at 12.3 percent. Around two-thirds of revenue comes from domestic formulation, the rest from international formulations and exports. ""Although the APIs are expected to witness dent in FY26, we expect the business to start ramping up back as the refurbished Navi Mumbai API plant starts operations in H2 FY26. We have baked in revenues CAGR of 12% for domestic formulations, 14 percent in international formulations and 15 percent in API Business during FY26-28E,"" said the latest report of ICICI Direct Research on the company.","“We have continued to maintain our momentum… we are at 12.6 percent growth as compared to market of 8.8 (percent),” Nair said.","Last year’s 30 percent had a one‑time reversal… actually the margin was 26.5 percent,” he said, adding “24–25 is a good EBITDA margin, going forward, we should maintain that.” RPG ended FY25 with revenue of Rs.653.4 crore, growing at 12.3 percent.","Acquisition strategy Nair said the company is targeting niche, low‑competition API portfolios in areas such as immunosuppressants, neuropsychiatry and cardiology.","“We are okay to acquire something below 1000 crore… we have a cash surplus of Rs 225 crores and the group is ready to support us,” he said, signalling a mix of internal accruals and RPG Group backing the funding route.",positive,0.8965314626693726

The stock fell as much as 3.5 percent in early trade following the earnings announcement. On the BSE, shares of Maruti Suzuki traded 3.4 percent lower at Rs 14,370, while on the NSE, they quoted 3.52 percent lower at Rs 14,353. With this, the stock extended its losing streak to a seventh consecutive session and has declined about 11 percent so far. The shares are down nearly 13.6 percent in January, so far. Maruti Suzuki said its consolidated profit for the December quarter rose 4 percent year-on-year to Rs 3,794 crore, impacted by higher costs and a one-time provision of Rs 594 crore related to the new Labour Codes. The profit, however, missed analysts’ expectations of Rs 4,261 crore. The stock has also remained under pressure after India and the European Union earlier this week announced tariff cuts on European car imports. Ambit Capital, which has a ‘Sell’ rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 13,286, said margins are being weighed down by higher electric vehicle spending, new capacity-related costs and a shift towards lower-margin models. It added that the company’s volume-led strategy risks prioritising market share over profitability. Emkay Global, which has a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock, said it remains positive on Maruti Suzuki’s long-term prospects, citing its aggressive product pipeline and expectations of a recovery in small car demand after years of subdued growth. However, the brokerage cut its price target by 4.5 percent to Rs 17,000, citing rising commodity pressures. Auto index see profit booking The sharp fall in Maruti Suzuki shares weighed on the Nifty Auto index, which declined up to 2 percent during the session. TVS Motor Company, Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki India and Exide Industries were among the major laggards in the auto index, with losses of up to 3 percent. Auto shares also came under pressure following reports that India will sharply reduce import duties on high-end European cars, lowering rates to 30 percent from as much as 110 percent under a new trade agreement with the European Union. The move would significantly open India’s auto market, benefiting luxury manufacturers such as BMW and Mercedes-Benz. India and the EU concluded the trade agreement on Tuesday, which is set to reduce tariffs across a wide range of goods and strengthen bilateral trade.

"Hindustan Copper shares surge 20%, metal index gains for 3rd day: What's behind the rally?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hindustan-copper-shares-surge-18-metal-index-gains-for-3rd-day-what-s-behind-the-rally-13796372.html,"Metal stocks extended their sharp surge for the third consecutive session on January 29, pushing the Nifty Metal index up more than 3 percent. Hindustan Copper shares were the top gainers on the index, jumping 20 percent to hit the upper circuit at an all-time high of Rs 760.05 apiece on Thursday. The stock has now rallied a whopping 314 percent in just nine months from its 52-week low of Rs 183.82 apiece, which it had hit in April this year. The Nifty Metal index rose to a record high of 12,498.60. This comes despite an overall bearish sentiment in markets, with benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty in the red. Why are Hindustan Copper shares rallying? Hindustan Copper shares have seen a sharp surge in recent days, rallying more than 42 percent in just three sessions so far after the company announced on January 24 that it has emerged as the preferred bidder for Baghwari-Khirkhori Copper and associated mineral block in Madhya Pradesh. The company had participated in the state government’s e-auction for the grant of mining lease and composite license for the said block. “Since, HCL had submitted the highest final price offer, it has been declared as the Preferred Bidder for this auction,” it said. The sharp surge in the shares of the Vedanta Group-company also comes amid the rally in copper prices, after the red metal gained 60 percent in 2025. Copper’s long-term fundamentals remain strong, and Indian investors increasingly seek global commodity exposure to help diversify their portfolios and use as hedges against inflation, said Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead, VT Markets. Why are metal stocks rising? Notably, gold and silver prices also jumped today, boosting the overall sentiment for metals. Gold futures with February expiry on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) jumped 9 percent to hit an all-time high of Rs 1,80,779 per 10 grams. The contracts with April and June expiries also surged around 9 percent each to fresh lifetime highs. Silver futures with March expiry meanwhile gained around 6 percent to hit a fresh all-time high of Rs 4,07,456 per kilogram. The contracts with May and July expiries also jumped around 6 percent each to their respective lifetime highs. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve decided to leave rates unchanged on Wednesday, as widely expected. However, investors are actively looking forward to some boost for manufacturing in the upcoming Budget, which will likely in turn may push the metal stocks further up. Growth in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) accelerated for the second straight month to a 26-month high of 7.8 percent on-year in December, compared with an upwardly revised 7.2 percent in November, driven by robust consumer demand, data released yesterday showed. On a sectoral basis, mining and electricity were drivers of higher IIP growth in December, while manufacturing growth moderated a little. Other metal stocks: National Aluminium Company (NALCO) gained around 6 percent, while Tata Steel, Vedanta and NMDC shares gained more than 4 percent each, as seen at 3.15 pm. Jindal Steel shares gained nearly 4 percent, while Hindalco Industries shares rose around 3 percent. JSW Steel shares jumped around 2 percent, while Steel Authority of India (SAIL), Hindustan Zinc and Adani Enterprises shares were up over 1 percent each. Jindal Stainless shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. Bucking the trend, APL Apollo Tubes and Welspun Corp shares fell up to 1 percent.

We factor in: 1) Volume CAGR of 7% over FY25–28E driven by market share gains from unorganised players in the Tiles segment, 2) Bathware segment revenue CAGR of 12% over FY25–28E, 3) Revenue contribution of 17%/12% from Projects/Bathware segments, respectively. Strong launches and sales in the Real Estate sector between FY22 and FY25 would help drive volume growth for SOMC over FY26–28E as these projects near completion, 4) EBITDA margin expansion of ~316 bps over FY25–28E. We forecast SOMC EBITDA/EPS CAGR of 20/44% over FY25–28E on the basis of our volume/realisation CAGR assumption of 7%/0.4% over the same period. We revise our 1-year forward target price for SOMC to INR 575/share (earlier INR 635/share). Our EPS estimate is reduced by 10.8% and 10.4% for FY26 and FY27E, respectively, primarily reflecting a 2% cut in the expected volume CAGR over FY25–FY28E. We value SOMC on our PEG ratio-based framework – we assign a PEG ratio of 0.9x on FY25–28E core EPS CAGR of 44%, which, we believe, is a conservative multiple. This valuation framework gives us the flexibility to assign a commensurate valuation multiple based on quantifiable earnings growth. Outlook We do a sanity check of our PEG ratio-based TP using implied EV/EBITDA, P/BV and P/E multiples. On our TP of INR 575, FY27E implied EVEBITDA/PB/PE multiples are 7.6x/2.4x/17.6x, all of which are reasonable in our view.

However, the yellow metal’s ETFs are currently outperforming those of silver after several sessions. Gold futures with February expiry on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) jumped 9 percent to hit an all-time high of Rs 1,80,779 per 10 grams. The contracts with April and June expiries also surged around 9 percent each to fresh lifetime highs. Silver futures with March expiry meanwhile gained around 6 percent to hit a fresh all-time high of Rs 4,07,456 per kilogram. The contracts with May and July expiries also jumped around 6 percent each to their respective lifetime highs. Why are gold and silver prices surging today? ""Growing U.S. debt and uncertainty created by signs that the global trade system is splintering into regional blocs as opposed to a U.S.-centric model (are leading investors to pile into gold),"" Reuters quoted Marex analyst Edward Meir as saying. This comes after US President Donald Trump urged Iran to engage in negotiations and strike a deal on nuclear weapons. He warned that any future US attack would be far more severe than the one in 2025 when Iranian nuclear sites were struck. Tehran responded with a threat to strike back against the US, Israel and those who support them. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve decided to leave rates unchanged on Wednesday, as widely expected. the precious metal also drew support from crypto group 's plans to allocate 10–15 percent of its investment portfolio to physical gold. Gold, silver ETFs jump: Kotak Gold ETF surged more than 13 percent to hit a fresh all-time high of Rs 155 apiece, while Baroda BNP Paribas Gold ETF gained around 10 percent. Axis Gold ETF, 360 ONE Gold ETF, Union Gold ETF, LIC MF ETF and others gained around 9 percent each. Motilal Oswal Silver ETF meanwhile gained around 8 percent to hit a fresh lifetime high of Rs 371.91 apiece. Nippon India Silver ETF and few others also gained around 8 percent each in the morning. Gold vs silver: Motilal Oswal Financial Services in a recent note highlighted that silver has delivered an exceptional rally of over 200 percent in the past 12 months, sharply outperforming gold’s 80 percent rise during the same period. This made silver one of the strongest-performing assets globally. However, the domestic brokerage noted that this sharp outperformance of the white metal has led to a significant compression in the gold–silver ratio, which has fallen from pandemic highs of 127 to around 50 at the beginning of 2026. “This reset suggests that while the long-term outlook for precious metals remains constructive, the near-term risk-reward equation may now be shifting in favour of gold after silver’s outsized run,” Motilal said. “Silver has delivered sharp outperformance in a short span, and with the gold–silver ratio now near lower levels, the near-term risk-reward is turning more favourable for gold. While we remain positive on both metals and silver continues to have long-term upside backed by industrial demand and tight physical market conditions, the recent rally has also increased near-term volatility. In this phase, a higher allocation to gold can help manage fluctuations while staying invested in precious metals,” said Navneet Damani, Head of Research Commodities and Manav Modi, Commodities Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. However, the domestic brokerage emphasized that it does not have a negative view on silver. But, it suggests a risk-managed reallocation strategy after an aggressive up move. It added that silver has become more volatile with sharper price swings, while gold continues to offer relatively better stability—making it a preferred near-term hedge in uncertain market conditions. Despite the sharp surge in prices, global silver ETFs have seen outflows of over 3 million ounces since the start of 2026, while gold ETFs have witnessed comparatively steadier inflows, reflecting investor preference for more defensive positioning, Motilal added. Also read: Is it time to shift money from equities to precious metals? Here's what analysts say The brokerage advises investors a 75 percent allocation to gold and 25 percent to silver, indicating a preference for gold as a relatively steadier hedge in the current environment, while still retaining meaningful exposure to silver’s long-term structural upside. “Going forward, we believe investors can benefit from a rebalanced precious metals strategy—retaining silver as a long-term structural theme, while increasing gold allocation to manage near-term volatility and capture a potentially stronger risk-adjusted opportunity in the next phase of the cycle,” Damani said. Long-term investors may consider staggered allocation within asset allocation limits, while short-term traders should remain cautious amid continued volatility, said Aditya Agrawal, Chief Investment Officer at Avisa Wealth Creators.

Brokerages have increased their target prices for the stock, citing several reasons. The shares of the company rose to Rs 3,932.6 in the early trading hours of Thursday, extending gains for the third consecutive session. L&T Q3 Results: Larsen & Toubro (L&T) reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 3,215 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 4 percent YoY fall from Rs 3,358.84 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. This however included a one-time exceptional cost of Rs 1,191 crore due to the implementation of new labour codes last year. Moneycontrol's poll of brokerages had estimated the firm’s net profit to rise to Rs 4,524 crore. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose 10.5 percent YoY to Rs 71,449.70 crore, missing MC poll estimate of Rs 75,011 crore. The Group’s consolidated order book as on December 31, 2025, stood at Rs 7,33,161 crore, reflecting a 30 percent YoY growth. International orders constituted 49 percent of the overall order book. Motilal Oswal on L&T: Motilal Oswal maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock, while raising its target price for the stock to Rs 4,600 apiece from Rs 4,500 earlier. The latest target price implies an upside potential of more than 21 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage said that the firm’s consolidated Q3 earnings were slightly below its estimates due to weaker-than-expected execution for core E&C. Revenue growth for core E&C, which has remained weak for the last two quarters, is expected to ramp up from the fourth quarter. On the positive side, Motilal said that order inflows remained strong, driven by large order wins in domestic and international markets, providing healthy visibility for revenue. An improved prospect pipeline, further reduction in NWC and healthy RoE give comfort in an environment where domestic execution and margin performance in select segments were weak, it added. JM Financial on L&T: JM Financial maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock, while raising its target price for the stock to Rs 4,655 apiece from Rs 4,500 earlier. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 23 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage noted that the company yet again reported a strong delivery on order inflows, significantly exceeding estimates. “We estimate 24% FY26E order inflows (vs 10%+ guidance) factoring in Q3 strength and a robust international outlook. We expect the order inflow strength to sustain in FY27 (est 11% growth). We raise our FY28E core EBITDA by 3% factoring in stronger FY26 inflows,” it said. Nomura on L&T: Nomura maintained its ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 4,510 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 19 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage noted that the company delivered robust order inflows, but execution missed estimates. It cut FY27–28 EBITDA estimates by 1-3 percent to factor in weaker energy segment margin. Jefferies on L&T: Jefferies maintained its ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 4,715 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 24 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm’s Q3 EBITDA was 4 percent above estimates, and margin also improved.

Track the latest updates on GIFT Nifty right here on Moneycontrol. Indian equity markets extended their winning streak for the second consecutive session on January 28, supported by buying interest in energy and metal names. After opening on a positive note, the market advanced further in the first half, with the Nifty testing an intraday high of 25,372.10. However, mid-session profit booking pared most of the gains, but final hour buying helped to close near day's high. At close, the Sensex was up 487.20 points or 0.60 percent at 82,344.68, and the Nifty was up 167.35 points or 0.66 percent at 25,342.75. GIFT Nifty (Down) The GIFT Nifty is trading lower at around 25,390, indicating a flat to negative start for the day. Asian Equities (Fall) Asia's runaway stock markets took a breather on Thursday as mixed earnings out of the tech sector stirred caution ahead of Apple's results, while the dollar looked shaky despite verbal support from both U.S. and European officials. US Equities (Up) The Nasdaq rose ​slightly with a boost from chip stocks while the S&P 500 closed virtually unchanged on Wednesday as investor reactions were muted after the Federal Reserve ‌kept interest rates unchanged as expected and gave little indication when borrowing costs might fall again. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 12.19 points, or 0.02%, to 49,015.60, the S&P 500 lost 0.57 points, or 0.01%, to 6,978.03 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 40.35 points, or 0.17%, ⁠to 23,857.45. US Bond Yield (Mixed) Yields on the 10-year and 2-year US Treasuries were little changed at 4.24% and 3.56%, respectively. Dollar Index (Down) The dollar index fell 0.2%, retracing some of the gains made after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the US hadn’t intervened to support the yen and reiterated a strong dollar policy. Asian Currencies (Mixed) Asian currencies were trading mixed in the early Thursday trade with Thai Baht leading the losers followed by Philippines Peso, Malaysian Ringgit, Taiwan Dollar. Crude (Up) Oil prices rose for a third day on Thursday on increasing concerns the U.S. may carry out a military attack on key Middle Eastern producer Iran that could disrupt supply from the region. Gold (Gains) Gold jumped to a record high above $ 5,500 an ounce, extending a breakneck rally fueled by US dollar weakness and investor flight from sovereign bonds and currencies.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Union Bank of India, NMDC, Rail Vikas Nigam, City Union Bank, and others on January 29?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-union-bank-of-india-nmdc-rail-vikas-nigam-city-union-bank-and-others-on-january-29-13795717.html,"Equity benchmarks gained six-tenths of a percent, extending the rally for the second straight session, with bulls backing market breadth on January 28. About 2,254 shares advanced, compared to 663 declining shares on the NSE. The market may consolidate after the two-day gains, with support placed at the previous day’s low. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities NMDC | CMP: Rs 81.52 NMDC has moved above the 200 DMA on the hourly chart, indicating an improvement in sentiment. On the daily chart, it has reclaimed the 50 DMA. The trend appears to be strengthening again, and with a positive crossover in the daily RSI, the price may move higher in the coming sessions. On the higher end, the stock could move towards the Rs 87–90 zone in the short term. On the lower end, support is placed at Rs 78.50; a break below this level may weaken sentiment. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 90 Stop-Loss: Rs 78.50 Rail Vikas Nigam | CMP: Rs 342.5 Rail Vikas Nigam has given a consolidation breakout on the daily chart, suggesting a rise in optimism. Additionally, the price has reclaimed and closed comfortably above the 50 DMA. The daily RSI has entered a bullish crossover, indicating strengthening momentum. On the higher end, the stock could move towards Rs 360 in the short term. On the lower end, support is placed at Rs 330; a break below this level may weaken sentiment. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 360 Stop-Loss: Rs 330 City Union Bank | CMP: Rs 293.3 City Union Bank has given a consolidation breakout on the daily chart, indicating improving sentiment. The price has been sustaining above the 21 EMA as well as the 50 EMA, confirming strength. The daily RSI is in a bullish crossover and trending higher. On the higher end, the stock could move towards Rs 330 in the short term. On the lower end, support is placed at Rs 278; a break below this level may weaken sentiment. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 330 Stop-Loss: Rs 278 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities Union Bank of India | CMP: Rs 181.93 Union Bank broke out above its major swing high zone of Rs 171–173 on January 14, supported by a clear rise in volumes, signaling a strong breakout. However, the stock failed to show immediate follow-through and retested the breakout zone, which acted as a strong support area as fresh buying interest emerged. A decisive follow-through move was seen on Wednesday, with the stock closing 3.84 percent higher. The stock continues to trade well above its key short-term and long-term moving averages, and the overall price structure suggests a high probability of further upside in the coming sessions. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the Rs 183–181 zone with a stop-loss of Rs 175. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 195 in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 195 Stop-Loss: Rs 175 Power Finance Corporation | CMP: Rs 383.05 PFC had been consolidating in a falling channel since the start of January before staging a decisive breakout, backed by a strong surge in volumes, indicating fresh buying interest. The RSI, which earlier struggled to sustain above the 60 mark, has now firmly moved past this level, signaling a clear pickup in bullish momentum. The DI+ crossing above DI– on the ADX indicator further confirms strengthening positive trend strength. Additionally, a fresh breakout in the Nifty PSE / Nifty ratio chart suggests potential near-term outperformance, positioning PFC as a likely leader within the sector. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the Rs 385–380 zone with a stop-loss of Rs 370. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 410 in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 410 Stop-Loss: Rs 370","The trend appears to be strengthening again, and with a positive crossover in the daily RSI, the price may move higher in the coming sessions.","Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 330 Stop-Loss: Rs 278 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities Union Bank of India | CMP: Rs 181.93 Union Bank broke out above its major swing high zone of Rs 171–173 on January 14, supported by a clear rise in volumes, signaling a strong breakout.","On the lower end, support is placed at Rs 78.50; a break below this level may weaken sentiment.","On the higher end, the stock could move towards the Rs 87–90 zone in the short term.",positive,0.5260287523269653

Outlook for January 29 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing decent bounce back with high volatility on Tuesday, Nifty witnessed a sustainable follow-through up move on Wednesday and closed the day higher by 167 points. After opening on a positive note, the market showed volatility within a range for better part of the session. The sharp upside has emerged towards the end and Nifty closed higher. A reasonable bull candle has been formed on the daily chart with upper and lower shadow. Technically, this market action indicates continuation of Pre-Budget rally and the market is now placed at the edge of breaking above the crucial overhead resistance of 25450 levels. The overall chart pattern of Nifty indicates a formation of short-term bottom reversal for the market. A sustainable move above the hurdle of 25450-25500 levels could open broad based rally for the Nifty towards 25800 levels in the near term. Immediate support is placed at 25200 levels. Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities Nifty opened on a strong note but quickly lost momentum, leading to range-bound trade for the major part of the day before sharp surge towards the last hour of the day led to Index closing 0.66% higher at 25,343. On the daily chart, the index has formed a bullish candle with a relatively long lower wick, indicating strong buying interest at lower levels. Despite the strong close above its 200-Day EMA, the Index has been hovering around this key level since last five sessions, underscoring persistent indecision and a tug-of-war between bulls and bears at this crucial long-term support. Going ahead, the key support for Nifty is placed in the 25,200–25,150 zone, which coincides with the 200-day EMA zone. A decisive breakdown below this zone could result in Nifty extending its weakness towards 24,900, followed by 24,600 in the near term. On the upside, the 25,450–25,500 zone is expected to act as an immediate resistance zone.

"BEL, BEML, other defence shares rise up to 12%, Nifty defence index soars 5%: Here are three likely reasons",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bel-beml-other-defence-shares-rise-up-to-12-nifty-defence-index-soars-5-here-are-three-likely-reasons-13794883.html,"Defence shares advanced on Wednesday, with Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL), BEML rising up to 12 percent, driven by broad-based buying across the sector. The strong momentum pushed the Nifty India Defence index up by around 5 percent during the session. Key factors behind the sharp rise in defence shares 1) India-EU defence pact: India and the European Union on Tuesday concluded a defence and security agreement aimed at enhancing cooperation in areas such as counter-terrorism, the Indo-Pacific and joint development of military hardware. The pact was finalised at the India-EU summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and European Council President Antonio Costa. Officials said the agreement would improve interoperability in the defence sector and create opportunities for Indian companies to participate in the EU’s Security Action for Europe (SAFE) programme, supporting long-term growth prospects for domestic defence manufacturers. 2) Rub-off from BEL rally: Shares of BEL jumped 10 percent to a record high of Rs 457.50 after the firm reported a 20.4 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit for the December quarter, while revenue from operations increased nearly 24 percent. BEL, which is also a constituent of the Nifty 50 index, saw heavy buying interest, triggering a spillover effect across other defence stocks. 3) Pre-Budget rally: The rally also comes ahead of the Union Budget scheduled for February 1. The Nifty India Defence index gained about 5 percent amid expectations that the government may announce a meaningful increase in capital expenditure for the defence sector, according to brokerage firms. The index extended gains for a second straight day and has risen more than 8 percent over the past two sessions.

Accumulate ABB India; target of Rs 5540: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/accumulate-abb-india-target-of-rs-5540-prabhudas-lilladher-2-13794377.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ABB India ABB IN has announced its intention to divest its Robotics business, in line with the global parent’s divestment of ABB Robotics Schweiz AG (“ARSAG”) to SoftBank Group. As part of the divestment, ABB IN incorporated ABB Robotics India Private Limited (“INRBT”) as a wholly owned subsidiary and proposes to transfer its Robotics business to INRBT on a slump-sale basis for a consideration of Rs15.7bn. ABB IN then will sell its entire stake in INRBT to ARSAG. The transaction is expected to be completed by 27 February 2026. In our view, the deal is value-accretive for ABB IN, implied at ~2.2x EV/TTM sales and ~24.4x EV/TTM EBIT (inc. other income). The divestment is likely to sharpen the company’s focus on its core portfolio and support at least 10-15bps improvement in EBIT margins in CY26E and CY27E. Additionally, the exit should marginally enhance return ratios, driven by the elimination of negative net capital employed in the Robotics business. Outlook The stock is currently trading at a PE of 53.3x/45.9x on CY26/27E. We have a ‘Accumulate’ rating on the stock valuing it at a multiple of 56x Sep’27E (same as earlier) arriving at a TP of Rs5,540 (same as earlier).

"ONGC, Oil India shares jump up to 10% to new record highs as oil prices rise",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ongc-oil-india-shares-jump-up-to-10-to-new-record-highs-as-oil-prices-rise-13794243.html,"The shares of state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India jumped up to 10 percent in trade on January 28, tracking the sharp rise in oil prices. This comes amid supply concerns after a severe winter storm disrupted US crude output and exports. Additionally, rising tensions in the Middle East also supported oil prices. Brent crude futures rose 33 cents to $67.90 a barrel, while WTI Crude futures gained 42 cents to trade at $62.81 per barrel, as seen at 11 am. The two stocks were among the top gainers on the Nifty Oil & Gas index, which was up more than 3 percent at 11,735.55. Why are oil prices rising? Oil extended gains as analysts estimated that US producers lost up to 2 million barrels per day or roughly 15 percent of national output over the weekend as the storm strained energy infrastructure and power grids. Crude and liquefied natural gas exports from U.S. Gulf Coast ports tumbled to zero on Sunday, Reuters quoted ship tracking service Vortexa as saying. The report added that Toshitaka Tazawa, an analyst at Fujitomi Securities, said that a loss of production in Kazakhstan is also underpinning the rally in oil prices. ""But once supply fears ease, selling pressure is likely to return,"" Tazawa added. He further said that an estimated global crude supply surplus this year amid geopolitical risks, including the Middle East tensions, could keep WTI trading around $60 a barrel for now. Tensions between US and Iran are also supporting oil prices. Reuters reported citing sources that a US aircraft carrier and supporting warships have arrived in the Middle East. This has raised the prospect of US President Donald Trump following through on his threat to attack Iran's senior leadership in response to the violent crackdown on nationwide protests, said ANZ analysts in a note. ONGC share price: ONGC shares jumped more than 7 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 266.2 apiece.

"DCB Bank Q3 FY26: Earnings momentum builds, re-rating still has legs",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/dcb-bank-q3-fy26-earnings-momentum-builds-re-rating-still-has-legs-13793999.html,"Highlights DCB Bank (CMP: Rs 198; Market cap: Rs 6,379 crore; Rating: Overweight) reported its highest-ever quarterly profit of Rs 185 crore in Q3 FY26, marking an increase of 23 percent YoY (year-on-year) despite one-off expense related to new labour code. The bank’s performance was broad-based, driven by healthy loan growth, robust fee income, better margins, improvement in operating efficiency, stronger asset quality, and contained credit costs. More encouragingly, the management expects margin expansion to continue through Q2 FY27, assuming no further rate cuts by the RBI. It has guided for a ROE (return on equity) of 13.5 percent in FY26 and 14.5 percent in FY27 — levels the bank has already effectively achieved in Q3 FY26. The reported ROA (return on asset) and the ROE for the quarter stood at 0.91 percent and 12.73 percent, respectively. However, excluding the one-off impact of the new labour code, the ROA would have been 1.01 percent and the ROE a healthy 14.1 percent in Q3 FY26, underscoring the underlying strength of profitability. DCB Bank’s stock has outperformed the sector benchmark (Bank Nifty) and overall market (Nifty) surging 46 percent and 70 percent in the past 6 months and 1 year respectively. The key question now is whether this rally can sustain. The most compelling aspect of DCB Bank is its valuation. Even after a sharp rally, the stock trades at only 0.9x its estimated FY27 book value, making it attractive. While a valuation re-rating hinges on the bank’s ability to sustain consistent performance, several profitability levers are in place that could drive further upside. Healthy business growth, robust fee income DCB Bank has maintained steady growth, with net advances rising to Rs 56,600 crore as of December 2025, reflecting a 18 percent YoY increase. DCB Bank aims to double its balance sheet over the next 3-3.5 years, targeting an annual loan growth of 18-22 percent. Mortgages constitute around 50 percent of the loan book as of September end. DCB’s deposits grew by 20 percent YoY till end December’25, higher than the banking system deposit growth, albeit on a smaller base. DCB’s CASA deposits ratio of 23 percent remains much lower compared to the banking system average. That said, it is reassuring to see the bank strengthening the granularity of its deposit base. Deposits from the top 20 depositors have come down to 6.61 percent of total deposits as of December 2025, compared to 15 percent in FY18, which adds stability to its funding profile. DCB Bank’s core fee income grew a strong 29 percent YoY, driven by robust traction in third-party distribution, trade finance, and processing fees. The management expects this momentum to sustain in Q4, which is seasonally strong for fee income. Over the medium term, the bank is confident of sustaining fee income at around 1 percent of average assets, broadly in line with the 1.1 percent achieved in Q3 FY26. Margin expansion to continue DCB’s net interest margin (NIM) came in at 3.27 percent in Q3 FY26, up 2 basis points YoY from the previous quarter (Q2 FY26). The management has guided to a gradual margin expansion from here onward till Q2 FY27, assuming the RBI doesn’t implement further rate cuts. The improvement is expected to play out over the next 3-4 quarters as the bank’s long-tenure fixed deposits will mature and get repriced at lower rates. In addition to lower funding costs, improved yields are expected to drive margin expansion. Over the past five years, DCB Bank has steadily built its home loan portfolio, which now accounts for nearly half of its mortgage book. Going forward, the bank aims to raise the share of business loans (LAP), which generate higher yields than home loans, while keeping the lower-margin co-lending portfolio capped at 15 percent of total advances. The bank had borrowings of more than Rs 8,000 crore as of March’25, which has declined to less than Rs 5,000 crore as the bank replaced it with relatively lower cost deposits. Together, the decline in funding costs and a more profitable product mix should support margin expansion. Operating efficiency improves DCB Bank effectively controlled its operating expenses aided by a reduction in employee base. Despite the one-off expense of Rs 27 crore in Q3 FY26, the cost-to-average assets ratio remained stable at 2.59 percent in Q3 FY26. Looking forward, the bank expects to benefit from the operating leverage as the balance sheet grows further. The management anticipates the cost-to-average-assets ratio to remain steady in the range of 2.5-2.6 percent and targets a cost-to-income ratio of 60 percent or below in the near term. Asset quality strengthens DCB Bank’s asset quality improved meaningfully in Q3 FY26, with a decline in both gross and net NPAs. More importantly, slippages fell to an 18-quarter low, signalling better asset quality trends. As a result, credit costs remained contained at just 37 bps—well below management’s guided 45 bps—even after accounting for floating provisions. The restructured book eased slightly but remains elevated at Rs 811 crore (1.4 percent of advances) as of December 2025 and needs to be monitored closely. View and Valuation Overall, DCB bank is poised for a healthy loan growth, margin expansion (assuming no further rate cut), stable cost-to-assets ratio, and a very low credit cost in near to medium term. This guidance is very encouraging and should drive healthy earnings growth in FY27 Despite the sharp rally post earnings, DCB Bank is trading at just 1 time FY27 estimated book value.
