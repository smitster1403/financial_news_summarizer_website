Reduce Britannia Industries; target of Rs 5500: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/reduce-britannia-industries-target-of-rs-5500-emkay-global-financial-2-13421634.html,"Emkay Global Financial' research report on Britannia Industries Q1 results were in line, adjusting for the Phantom Stock Option Scheme expenses. Under this scheme, employees are being incentivized with a Rs520mn payout, based on 19% stock price return. We believe this arrangement could weigh on near-term performance, as any stock price appreciation from strong execution will be rewarded back to the management, impacting reported financials. The management aims to offset the impact from next year. We find the recent actions to be accretive, ie: a) a sharper focus on health and indulgence through new launches; b) faster growth in Quick Commerce (now 3% of sales; 500bps higher market share), and c) healthy price hikes, along with expected RM stability. Our double-digit earnings growth forecast for FY26E remains intact, even after the 5% earnings cut. As the stock appears to be fairly valued, the employee cost impact from the scheme seems immaterial. Outlook We maintain REDUCE, lowering our Jun-26E TP by 6% to Rs5,500, based on 48x P/E (revised from 50x, now aligned with the 5Y average forward P/E).

Brokerages were quick to turn optimistic. CLSA maintained an “outperform” rating with a target price of Rs 4,394 per share, noting its confidence in management’s jewellery EBIT margin guidance of 11 to 11.5 percent for FY26. Jefferies retained a “buy” rating and lifted its target price to Rs 3,800 per share, citing robust growth in both jewellery and watches, along with healthy margin expansion in the June quarter. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Prabhudas Lilladher also maintained its “buy” call, setting a target price of Rs 3,901 per share. The brokerage remains upbeat on the company’s long-term outlook, pointing to its efforts to enhance product mix, the strategic shift towards lightweight jewellery, and a strong medium-term growth runway led by innovative designs. Citi, however, struck a more cautious tone, assigning a “neutral” rating with a target price of Rs 3,900 per share. While acknowledging Titan’s near-term growth potential relative to other discretionary categories, the brokerage flagged medium-term margin risks from intense competition, high gold prices, and an unfavourable product mix. In Q1FY26, Titan’s consolidated net profit surged 52.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,091 crore, while revenue jumped 24.6 percent to Rs 16,523 crore. Operating profit (EBITDA) rose 46.7 percent to Rs 1,830 crore from Rs 1,247 crore a year earlier. EBITDA margin improved to 11.1 percent from 9.4 percent, surpassing expectations of 10.6 percent. The jewellery division, Titan’s biggest revenue generator, posted a 19 percent year-on-year growth (excluding bullion and digi-gold sales) despite persistently high gold prices. The watches and wearables segment logged one of its best quarters ever, with revenue up 24 percent to Rs 1,273 crore. The EyeCare business grew 13 percent year-on-year to Rs 238 crore, delivering an EBIT of Rs 20 crore with an 8.4 percent margin. Meanwhile, Titan Engineering & Automation reported a 56 percent jump in income to Rs 307 crore. Within this, Automation Solutions grew 82 percent, while Manufacturing Services expanded 16 percent, buoyed by strong demand from the aerospace sector.

Neutral Bajaj Auto; target of Rs 8561: LKP Research,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/neutral-bajaj-auto-target-of-rs-8561-lkp-research-13421305.html,"LKP Research's research report on Bajaj Auto Bajaj Auto (BAL) reported muted Q1FY26 results. Revenue came in at ₹120.8 bn, registering growth of 4.6% YoY and 3.3% QoQ. Domestic performance remained subdued, primarily due to (1) the early and intense onset of the monsoon, (2) elevated inflation in metro cities, (3) purchase deferments by customers, and (4) heightened competitive intensity. However, strong export performance helped offset the domestic weakness, with export volumes witnessing robust growth and premium bike sales reaching an all-time high in international markets. EBITDA margin stood at 19.7% in Q1FY26, down 53 bps YoY and 20 bps QoQ. The decline was driven by an unfavourable currency environment in key export geographies, rising commodity costs, and supply chain disruptions related to rare earth magnets. These challenges impacted production of the Chetak EV and EV 3Ws. The company reported PBT of ₹27.9 bn, with PBT margin improving by 37 bps YoY to 23%, supported by higher other income and lower finance costs. Looking ahead, we expect BAL to face near-term margin pressure due to intensifying competition in the +125cc segment and continued supply constraints stemming from the rare earth magnet shortage. Outlook We estimate revenue/EBITDA/PBT to grow at a CAGR of 9%/9%/8% over FY25–27E and value the stock at 25x FY27E EPS, arriving at a target price of ₹8,561.

Kalyan Jewellers sharply lower by over 7 percent on heavy volumes despite strong Q1 earnings,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/kalyan-jewellers-sharply-lower-by-over-7-percent-on-heavy-volumes-despite-strong-q1-earnings-13421276.html,"Shares of Kalyan Jewellers are sharply lower in the trading session on August 8, down over 7 percent with volumes that are nearly three times the one-month average, despite a healthy June quarter result. On August 7, Kalyan reported a net profit of Rs 264 crore for the June quarter, up 49 percent on year, with revenue from operations higher by 31 percent at Rs 7,268.48 crore. The Q1FY26 EBITDA was higher by 38 percent on year at Rs 508 crore. Ramesh Kalyanaraman, ED, Kalyan Jewellers told CNBC-TV18 during an interaction that the Same Store Sales Growth has been 'very strong' in the range of 18 percent, maintaining the double-digit growth trend of past 6-8 quarters, and there are no triggers that would change this drastically. Going forward, the jeweller is hoping to benefit from more number of festive days in the ongoing Q2FY26. The jeweller also said it has reduced bank loans by Rs 500 crore so far. Rising Share of Organised Players The organised retail market share in the jewellery business has been consistently rising from 32 percent in 2020 to 40 percent this year, with high demand and ownership in the rural India. Kalyan said it is sitting with a 7 percent share in the organised pie, and its strong brand and scalable model positions it well to capitalise on the opportunity arising from the shift towards organised jewellery. The jeweller is expanding largely via a capital-light franchise store strategy. Kalayn also said it plans to launch new regional brands offering exclusively localised designs. On a YTD basis, the shares are down nearly 29 percent but are flat over last one year. Another leading company from the same space, Titan Company, has said that it is exploring 14 and 18-carat jewellery options in order to offer more affordable pricing for customers. Street View Motilal Oswal said in a note that with the successful ramp up of the new franchise businesses - which add 40 percent to the revenue - along with continued success in non-Southern markets, Kalyan has emerged as a leading brand, assigning a target price of Rs 1800 per share with a Buy call. Tariff Jitters The gems and jewellery space has also had to contend with the additional levy by US President Trump, which could make US exports unattractive for the sector as a whole. Trade think tank GTRI has said in a note that the India's export segments can be grouped in three categories - very high impact (exports hit of 50-70 percent), high-impact (30-50 percent hit), and low or no impact areas. Among the nine products in the very high impact category, diamonds, gold and jewellery are one of them. Gems and jewellery exporters' association GJEPC has urged the government for policy reforms to support the industry. America is the largest market for Indian gems and jewellery, accounting for over $10 billion in exports, which accounts for nearly 30 percent of the industry's total global trade, Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) chairman Kirit Bhansali has said. In an interaction with Bloomberg TV, TK Ramesh, the ED of Kalyan Jeweller said it plans to expand its Dubai manufacturing unit, potentially a move to offset any tariff-related setback. Impact of High Gold Prices Another leading company from the same space, Titan Company, has said that it is exploring 14 and 18-carat jewellery options in order to offer more affordable pricing for customers. In a separate development, the Financial Times has reported that the US has put tariffs on imports of one-kilogram gold bars, a move that could add volatility to the global bullion market, and is a setback for the precious metals business out of Switzerland, following which gold futures in New York have surged to a record high.","On August 7, Kalyan reported a net profit of Rs 264 crore for the June quarter, up 49 percent on year, with revenue from operations higher by 31 percent at Rs 7,268.48 crore.","Impact of High Gold Prices Another leading company from the same space, Titan Company, has said that it is exploring 14 and 18-carat jewellery options in order to offer more affordable pricing for customers.","Trade think tank GTRI has said in a note that the India's export segments can be grouped in three categories - very high impact (exports hit of 50-70 percent), high-impact (30-50 percent hit), and low or no impact areas.","In a separate development, the Financial Times has reported that the US has put tariffs on imports of one-kilogram gold bars, a move that could add volatility to the global bullion market, and is a setback for the precious metals business out of Switzerland, following which gold futures in New York have surged to a record high.",negative,0.9516938328742981

The shares of the company are now more than 62 percent higher than the IPO price. The shares have now gained nearly 48 percent in the three sessions since their market debut. The market capitalization of the company surged significantly in the first three days to cross Rs 25,000-mark. The shares of NSDL had made a decent stock market debut on August 6, listing at Rs 880 apiece on BSE. This marked a premium of 10 percent over its IPO price at Rs 880 apiece. The listing premium was lower than grey market estimates. Ahead of listing, the unlisted shares of the company were trading with a grey market premium of nearly 16 percent over the IPO price. According to analysts, investors should consider holding the stock for the long term, given NSDL’s strong fundamentals and leadership in the depository segment. NSDL’s P/E ratio currently stands at around 77, higher than that of peer CDSL whose P/E ratio currently stands at around 66. Prashanth Tapse, Senior Vice President (Research Analyst) at Mehta Equities Ltd, said, ""NSDL continues to lead in value-based transactions and institutional account holdings, backed by strong industry trust and technological infrastructure. Alongside CDSL, it operates in a near-duopoly, with high entry barriers for new players."" ""For investors allotted shares, it is advisable to hold from a long-term perspective. Non-allotted investors can wait for any post-listing dip to enter,"" he added. Saurabh Jain, Head - Equity Research - fundamentals at SMC Global Securities, noted ""With dominant market share, a wide service reach, and diversified asset coverage, NSDL is well-positioned for long-term growth, supported by macroeconomic tailwinds and regulatory enablers.

Moneycontrol had reported a day before that Sunil Mittal-led promoter entity is looking at a part stake sale in the telecom major. ""The transaction has been launched at a floor price of Rs 1,862 per share, which is at a 3.15% discount to the last closing price,"" one of the persons familiar with the development had said. Indian Continent Investment, a Sunil Mittal-led promoter group entity that has likely trimmed its stake, holds 2.47% stake in Bharti Airtel. After the June quarter earnings, Morgan Stanley had maintained its 'equal-weight' on Airtel, with a price target of Rs 1,890 per share. CLSA had kept its 'outperform' rating with a target price of Rs 2,035 per share. Macquarie, too, had maintained 'outperform' rating with a price target of Rs 2,050 per share after the Q1FY26 results. Read More Bharti Airtel posted a robust free cashflow of Rs 14,500 crore and managed to trim net debt by Rs 13,000 crore sequentially to Rs 1.26 lakh crore in the June quarter. The telecom company is ramping up its fiber rollout from 1.6 million to 2.5 million home pass-ups per quarter, and is treating both FTTH and FWA under a single WiFi strategy. Airtel's ARPU rose to Rs 250, helped by a better subscriber mix and an extra day in the quarter. Airtel's digital network across India and Africa now serve over 60 crore customers. ""Africa reported solid performance with 6.7% growth in constant currency. India Mobile business recorded a sequential growth of 2.9%, driven by continued focus on portfolio premiumization..."", Gopal Vittal, Vice Chairman and MD of Bharti Airtel had said after the earnings. Over the last five years, Airtel has invested over Rs 1.6 trillion in expanding its digital infrastructure, and the company has said in the past that the capex will trend down in FY26, with a large part of the heavy lifting largely done. The data center capex is part of the overall capex to be incurred by the company and is on track with previous guidance of around Rs 5,000 crore spread over three years.","After the June quarter earnings, Morgan Stanley had maintained its 'equal-weight' on Airtel, with a price target of Rs 1,890 per share.","Over the last five years, Airtel has invested over Rs 1.6 trillion in expanding its digital infrastructure, and the company has said in the past that the capex will trend down in FY26, with a large part of the heavy lifting largely done.","After the June quarter earnings, Morgan Stanley had maintained its 'equal-weight' on Airtel, with a price target of Rs 1,890 per share.","Over the last five years, Airtel has invested over Rs 1.6 trillion in expanding its digital infrastructure, and the company has said in the past that the capex will trend down in FY26, with a large part of the heavy lifting largely done.",negative,0.9710337519645691
"Nifty, Sensex to see muted start as tariff pressures weigh; key levels to watch on August 8",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nifty-sensex-to-see-muted-start-as-tariff-pressures-weigh-key-levels-to-watch-in-august-8-13420017.html,"Equity benchmarks Nifty 50 and Sensex could open mildly in the red on Friday, August 8, as President Donald Trump decision to double tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent could pressure the bulls. At 7.30 am, the GIFT Nifty index was trading lower by 0.2 percent or 50 points at 24,644. In the previous session, Nifty 50 and Sensex staged a smart recovery in the last hour of trade, erasing sharp intraday losses, to eke out minor gains as possibilities of talks between U.S. and Russia lifted sentiment. Earlier in the session, the market took a sharp fall as U.S. President Donald Trump announced an additional 25 percent tariff on Indian goods, taking the total tariff rate to 50 percent. Trump's move comes in response to New Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil and defence equipment. After the order, the total tariff on Indian goods, barring a small exemption list, will be 50 percent. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session Yesterday's intraday pullback and strong close indicate possible short-term momentum building up for the sessions ahead, as concerns over tariff impositions failed to dent overall market sentiment. The 24,500 level continues to act as a pivotal support zone, reflecting resilience among buyers. Immediate support lies at 24,450, aligning with a previous demand zone. Unless breached decisively, any dip is likely to attract fresh buying interest. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart hovers around 40 but has started showing a positive divergence, hinting at easing bearish momentum. Intraday indicators also signal a reversal from oversold territory. ""The overall structure remains oversold, suggesting that any pullbacks may offer opportunities to initiate fresh long positions as optimism gradually returns,"" said Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivatives Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities. India VIX edged lower by 2.28 percent, closing at 11.68. Despite global tariff-related developments, implied volatility remains subdued and anchored near neutral territory. The persistent low VIX suggests the broader market is expecting consolidation rather than sharp downside risks, indicating that caution exists without panic.

However, the market breadth remained favourable for bears, with about 1,478 shares under pressure against 1,205 rising shares on the NSE. The sustainability of Thursday's recovery is the key to watch, as frontline indices remained well below short-term moving averages. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services Ambuja Cements | CMP: 592.35 Ambuja achieved a breakout above a triangular pattern on June 27 and is now holding support near the 50EMA, retesting prior horizontal resistance levels after the breakout. A minor hurdle lies at Rs 606; breaking above this could target Rs 630 and Rs 650. A stop-loss is recommended at Rs 577. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 630, Rs 650 Stop-Loss: Rs 577 TVS Motor Company | CMP: Rs 3,013.4 TVS Motor achieved a strong breakout above a resistance level that had been in place since September 2024. This level was tested on June 27, 2025, but the stock was unable to break above it until August 5, when it finally did so with robust positive volume. Support is at Rs 2,720 (buy on dips till Rs 2,700). Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,440, Rs 3,700 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,600 Reliance Industries | CMP: Rs 1,389.4 Reliance is near its critical 200EMA support and the horizontal support level from the May 9, 2025 low, forming a dragonfly doji at this level—signaling a potential bullish reversal. The MACD histogram is rising, hinting at a possible positive crossover in upcoming sessions. There has also been a positive volume increase over the last two sessions. A small resistance lies at Rs 1,420; a break above this could target Rs 1,470 and Rs 1,500. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,470, Rs 1,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,350 Mandar Bhojane, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking BSE | CMP: Rs 2,442.2 BSE is currently exhibiting a strong bullish setup, with technical signals aligning across multiple timeframes. On the daily chart, the stock is forming a Descending Triangle pattern, which typically indicates accumulation and a decline in selling pressure. A decisive close above Rs 2,450, accompanied by strong volumes, would confirm a breakout and could trigger a sharp upward rally. The stock is trading well above its 100-day and 200-day EMAs, reflecting sustained strength across medium- and long-term time horizons. The RSI stands at 45.47 and is gradually rising, suggesting growing buying interest without entering overbought territory. Additionally, momentum remains favourable, supported by a positive MACD crossover, which further validates the bullish structure. Traders may adopt a 'buy-on-dips' strategy near Rs 2,370, with a stop-loss at Rs 2,280. Upon a confirmed breakout above Rs 2,450, the stock has the potential to rally towards Rs 2,750 and Rs 2,800. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,750, Rs 2,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,280 Aditya Birla Capital | CMP: Rs 278.15 Aditya Birla Capital is consolidating just above a key breakout zone, indicating underlying strength. On the weekly chart, the stock has recently broken out from a Cup and Handle pattern—a classic bullish reversal setup. Rising volumes during the consolidation phase highlight growing investor participation, increasing the likelihood of a sustained upside breakout. A decisive close above Rs 280 would validate the pattern breakout and could trigger strong bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 71.4 and trending upward, indicating robust momentum with room for further upside. On the downside, Rs 265 acts as immediate support, offering an ideal buy-on-dips opportunity for positional traders. If the breakout sustains with continued buying interest, the stock could potentially rally towards Rs 320 and Rs 350. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 320, Rs 350 Stop-Loss: Rs 260 Cholamandalam Financial Holdings | CMP: Rs 1,849.1 Cholamandalam Financial Holdings has recently reversed from a strong demand zone near the 200EMA, forming a Morning Star candlestick pattern on the daily chart. This bullish reversal pattern, coupled with rising volumes, signals renewed buying interest and suggests a potential trend reversal in favour of the bulls. From a momentum standpoint, the RSI is at 36.39 and trending upward, also exhibiting a bullish divergence—further strengthening the case for a positive move ahead. On the downside, Rs 1,800 acts as a strong support level, making it a key accumulation zone for traders looking to enter on dips. If the stock sustains above current levels with continued volume participation, it could rally towards the short-term target of Rs 2,035. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,035 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,760 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Procter & Gamble Health | CMP: Rs 6,313 Procter & Gamble Health extended its breakout move above the neckline of a well-defined Cup and Handle pattern on the daily chart. The breakout above the Rs 6,200–Rs 6,250 zone was accompanied by a noticeable surge in volume, confirming strong participation and validating the bullish continuation pattern. The price is now trading well above all key moving averages, including the 9-day, 20-day, and 50-day SMAs. The rounded base formation found strong support near Rs 5,800, with the handle consolidating tightly just below the neckline. This classic setup resolved with a clean breakout, and the subsequent retest of the neckline has been absorbed well. The RSI has remained steady at 70, and its upward slope may continue in the coming sessions. The MACD is in a strong bullish crossover, with the histogram expanding positively and the fast line accelerating away from the signal line—reinforcing the strength behind the breakout. The earlier resistance near Rs 6,100 now acts as immediate support, and any short-term pullback toward this zone may offer a buying opportunity. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 6,090 Delhivery | CMP: Rs 465.75 Delhivery surged 8.35% in the current week, registering its strongest weekly performance in recent months and confirming a breakout from a long consolidation band. The stock decisively crossed above the Rs 440–450 supply zone, a level that had consistently capped upside over the past several quarters—marking a trend reversal on the higher time frame. The rally has been backed by expanding volume, with the stock now trading significantly above both the 20-week and 50-week SMAs. The RSI has entered overbought territory at 76, reflecting robust momentum, although it remains stable with no signs of divergence. The MACD has been in a bullish crossover for several weeks and continues to expand positively. The breakout zone near Rs 451 now acts as immediate support on any minor pullback. The broader structure suggests that the uptrend may continue, with any dip offering re-entry opportunities. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 510. Stop-Loss: Rs 445 Eternal | CMP: Rs 301.75 Eternal is attempting to stabilize after breaking out from a rising channel earlier this month. The breakout occurred with strong bullish momentum and volume expansion, lifting the stock decisively above the Rs 290 mark. The stock has entered a healthy retest phase and is now hovering just above the rising trendline. This retest aligns with the 20-day SMA at Rs 290, which has started acting as dynamic support. The long lower wick of recent candles suggests that dips are being absorbed—indicating a possible continuation if support holds. The RSI currently stands at 63, cooling off from the overbought zone while maintaining a positive slope above the 60 level. This indicates sustained momentum without signs of divergence. Meanwhile, the MACD remains positively skewed. The volume trends remain supportive, with higher accumulation visible on breakout days. The Rs 295 zone now serves as a critical support base, and any further dips into this zone may provide renewed buying interest.

Biocon posts Rs 31 crore net profit in Q1FY26,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/biocon-posts-rs-31-crore-net-profit-in-q1fy26-13418799.html,"Biocon net profit before exceptional items rose 342% year-on-year to Rs 31 crore on a like-for-like basis for the first quarter of FY26, driven by robust growth in its biosimilars business and improved operating leverage across segments. The company had a one-time benefit of Rs 1,057 crore in Q1 last year due to divestment of its India branded formulation units. Operating revenue grew 15% YoY to Rs 3,942 crore, with EBITDA rising 19% to Rs 829 crore. Core EBITDA stood at Rs 1,003 crore, with margins at 25%. The company spent Rs 205 crore net R&D or 7% of revenue, ex-Syngene. “Our biosimilars and CRDMO businesses continued to deliver strong momentum, while generics held steady,” said Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, Chairperson of Biocon Group. “The recent QIP has strengthened our balance sheet and enables us to increase our ownership in Biocon Biologics.” Biosimilars revenue, which constitutes 61% of revenues, rose 18% YoY to Rs 2,458 crore, with EBITDA up 36% to Rs 645 crore and margins stood at 26% on like-to-like basis. The company launched Yesafili in Canada and received USFDA approval for Kirsty, its second interchangeable biosimilar insulin. Generics revenue grew 6% YoY to Rs 697 crore, driven by new launches including Liraglutide in the EU and Dasatinib in the US. CRDMO (Syngene) revenue rose 11% YoY to Rs 875 crore, with EBITDA up 19% to Rs 224 crore, supported by long-term contract conversions and expanded scientific capabilities. Biocon raised Rs 4,500 crore via a Qualified Institutions Placement (QIP) in June to consolidate its stake in Biocon Biologics and facilitate investor exits. The company also commissioned a new GLP-1-focused injectable facility in Bangalore, with commercialization expected in FY27. With 19 global launches and 12 biosimilars already commercialized, Biocon is expanding its footprint in advanced and emerging markets. “We are confident in our ability to scale, deepen market presence, and deliver sustained growth,” said Shreehas Tambe, CEO of Biocon Biologics.","Generics revenue grew 6% YoY to Rs 697 crore, driven by new launches including Liraglutide in the EU and Dasatinib in the US.","“The recent QIP has strengthened our balance sheet and enables us to increase our ownership in Biocon Biologics.” Biosimilars revenue, which constitutes 61% of revenues, rose 18% YoY to Rs 2,458 crore, with EBITDA up 36% to Rs 645 crore and margins stood at 26% on like-to-like basis.","Biocon net profit before exceptional items rose 342% year-on-year to Rs 31 crore on a like-for-like basis for the first quarter of FY26, driven by robust growth in its biosimilars business and improved operating leverage across segments.","“The recent QIP has strengthened our balance sheet and enables us to increase our ownership in Biocon Biologics.” Biosimilars revenue, which constitutes 61% of revenues, rose 18% YoY to Rs 2,458 crore, with EBITDA up 36% to Rs 645 crore and margins stood at 26% on like-to-like basis.",positive,0.9570003747940063
Eris Lifesciences eyes Novo Nordisk’s exit to expand human insulin play in India,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/eris-lifesciences-eyes-novo-nordisk-s-exit-to-expand-human-insulin-play-in-india-13418283.html,"Eris Lifesciences is positioning itself to capture a significant share of India’s human insulin market following Novo Nordisk’s exit from the pen cartridge segment. The Ahmedabad-based drugmaker, which acquired Biocon’s insulin portfolio, is now working to bring insulin manufacturing in-house—a plan that has faced regulatory delays but remains central to its long-term strategy. “We expect this opportunity to start playing out from November–December,” said V. Krishnakumar, Executive Director and COO of Eris. “This financial year we’ll probably get four to five months of revenue, but the full-year impact will be seen in FY27,” Krishnakumar said. Eris competes against Lupin and Wockhardt in human insulin segment. According to market research firm IMARC Group, the Indian insulin market was valued at $635.70 million in 2024 and is growing at 3.9% annually.. Eris currently sources human insulin from both Biocon and MJ Biopharm, with plans to internalize formulation manufacturing by year-end. The company has also made its first foray into drug substance manufacturing through an investment in Levim Lifetech, which is developing recombinant products including weight loss and anti-diabetes GLP-1 drug semaglutide. Eris last year acquired a 30% stake in Levim for ₹54 crore, valuing the latter at ₹180 crore. This investment is part of Eris's strategy to expand its biotechnology footprint, particularly in areas like biologics. Gearing up for ""day-one"" Semaglutide launch in India Eris is preparing for a “day-one” launch of semaglutide in India once the patent expires in March 2026. “Everything looks to be in good shape,” Krishnakumar said. The company is validating cartridges at its Swiss Parenterals unit and expects to begin in-house production of the drug product later this year. The move builds on Eris’ growing injectable platform and its September 2024 launch of liraglutide, which has already crossed ₹7 crore in quarterly sales. “The fact that we have a very strong insulin platform gives us a significant tailwind in selling GLPs,” he added. Targeting high-growth therapies Eris has reoriented 30% of its portfolio toward high-growth therapies—segments with volume growth above 3–4% annually. These include biologics, injectables, dermatology, and loss-of-exclusivity (LOE) opportunities. “This change in portfolio gives us a big tailwind,” Krishnakumar said. The company’s domestic branded formulations business grew ahead of the Indian Pharmaceutical Market (IPM), aided by this strategic shift and strong field execution. Debt reduction and M&A pause Eris is also on track to reduce its net debt to ₹1,800 crore by FY26, or 1.5x EBITDA, funded entirely through internal cash flows. “Two things I never worry about at Eris are EBITDA margin and cash flow,” Krishnakumar said, citing consistent 35–36% margins and 75–80% cash conversion. Eris reported a 41 percent on-year (YoY) increase in its consolidated net profit for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 at Rs 125 crore driven by strong performance in its domestic branded formulations (DBF) business and improved operating margins. The company’s consolidated revenue rose 7.4% YoY to ₹773 crore, while EBITDA grew 11% YoY to ₹277 crore, with margins expanding by 106 basis points to 35.8%. Following the Biocon acquisition, Eris is taking a pause on large M&A. “We’re not in a rush,” he said. “Our journey over the next three years will be about going deeper into what we already have—oncology, critical care, injectables, women’s health.” While many Indian pharma companies are expanding into trade generics, Eris is scaling down its presence in that segment. “Our DNA is top of the pyramid,” Krishnakumar said. “We’ve expanded our covered market from ₹70,000 crore to ₹120,000 crore without getting into acute therapies,” he said.","“We’ve expanded our covered market from ₹70,000 crore to ₹120,000 crore without getting into acute therapies,” he said.","The company’s consolidated revenue rose 7.4% YoY to ₹773 crore, while EBITDA grew 11% YoY to ₹277 crore, with margins expanding by 106 basis points to 35.8%.","“This financial year we’ll probably get four to five months of revenue, but the full-year impact will be seen in FY27,” Krishnakumar said.","According to market research firm IMARC Group, the Indian insulin market was valued at $635.70 million in 2024 and is growing at 3.9% annually..

A long bull candle was formed on the daily chart with lower shadow. Technically, this pattern shows an early sign of crucial bottom reversal pattern in the Nifty. Further follow-through upmove above the initial hurdle of 24750 could confirm the bottom reversal pattern. The crucial supports to be watched around 24350. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty witnessed a roller-coaster session as the index oscillated between 24,350 and 24,650. Although it briefly fell below 24,400, it did not sustain at lower levels and recovered smartly in the second half, closing near 24,600.

"Nifty Realty drops 1.4%, extends losses for third day: 5 reasons behind sector-wide sell-off",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nifty-realty-drops-1-4-extends-losses-for-third-day-5-reasons-behind-sector-wide-sell-off-13413403.html,"Real estate stocks recorded significant losses on August 7, pushing the Nifty Realty index down 1.4 percent. The index has now extended losses for the third consecutive session, buoyed by multiple factors. The realty index has recorded losses in 11 out of 13 straight sessions. The index declined nearly 15 percent in 2025 so far, after a strong surge of nearly 45 percent in 2024. Several factors have led to the decline in the share prices. No repo rate cut in August: RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra on August 6 announced the Monetary Policy Committee’s decision to snap a three-time streak and keep repo rate unchanged at 5.5 percent. Repo rates directly influence home loan interest rates, affecting EMIs and loan costs. Hence, no rate cut dampens sentiment. While a rate cut, as the real estate sector at large was hoping for, would have further accelerated the demand for homes across segments, borrowing costs continue to remain at relatively accommodative levels, supported by the cumulative 100 basis points reduction earlier this year, said Ashok Kapur, Chairman, Krishna Group and Krisumi Corporation. Additionally, several analysts already expect the RBI to cut its repo rate in October during this year. This may boost the real estate stocks in the near term. IT layoffs: TCS recently announced massive layoffs. Nearly 12,000 employees are set to part ways from the IT major. Analysts consider this to be a precursor to further layoffs in the tech sector. This can have some repercussion on India’s economic growth going forward including in sectors like real estate and more, said Samir Jasuja, Founder & CEO, PropEquity, who also noted how housing sales have come down from its recent highs. Trump tariffs: US President Donald Trump has doubled his tariffs on India to 50 percent. While it has no direct bearing with India domestic real estate market, it will likely create an impact on the individual earnings of some sectors like IT, which may in turn reduce discretionary spending limits. This may bear an impact on real estate demand. Subdued real estate prices: The sharp fall in the share prices comes on the back of subdued real estate prices, says Shravan Shetty, Managing Director at Primus Partners. According to Shetty, lower GDP growth, higher interest rates, along with high supply expected in key markets like Mumbai, especially in the luxury space, are keeping real estate prices subdued. This will likely put pressure on the margins of these real estate companies as input costs continue to rise over the next few quarters. Weak earnings: The recent drop in the stocks was also driven by weak earnings announced by some of the key players. Oberoi Realty on July 21 reported a 28 percent decline in Q1 net profit. Macrotech Developers and few others also reported sequential decline in bottom line. ASSOCHAM however feels that real estate stocks will instead find support from stable rates of RBI, as it signals stability despite global uncertainties. Vimal Nadar, National Director and Head of Research, Colliers India, also noted that stability in monetary policy augurs well for homebuyers and real estate developers, particularly in the affordable and mid-income segments. The lowering of interest rates in the recent past is expected to be fully passed on to the end users in upcoming quarters, who are likely to benefit from reduced financing costs. Overall, the cautious yet growth-supportive monetary policy is likely to strengthen demand across real estate segments in the second half of 2025. Additionally, several analysts already expect the RBI to cut its repo rate in October during this year. This may further boost the real estate stocks in the near term. The shares of Raymond and Brigade Enterprises dropped nearly 3 percent each, while DLF, Godrej Properties and Macrotech Developers (Lodha) shares were down nearly 2 percent each, as seen at 2 pm. Sobha and Anant Raj shares were down nearly 1 percent, Phoenix Mills and Oberoi Realty shares were trading in the red with marginal losses.

Speaking on the company’s Q1FY26 earnings call, management said key components such as EV motors, engine speed sensors, wheel speed sensors, and bank angle sensors — all of which rely on rare earth magnets — are covered for now. However, it also noted that work is underway to explore long-term alternatives to mitigate the risk. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The commentary comes at a time when rival Bajaj Auto is feeling the heat from the deepening supply crunch. Bajaj slashed production of its electric two-wheelers by up to 50 percent in July, citing a global shortage of heavy rare earth magnets. The company expects output to remain constrained in August and September as well, with production forecast to stay at just over half of planned levels. The disruption has been triggered by China’s suspension of rare earth magnet exports since April. As the dominant force in the sector, China accounts for 60 percent of global rare earth production and 90 percent of refining. Its pause has sent tremors across global supply chains, particularly impacting EV makers who rely on these magnets for high-efficiency motors and critical electronics. Also read: 'What is good for India is good for Reliance': Full text of Mukesh Ambani's letter to shareholders Rare earth magnets are a critical part of EV technology, allowing for compact, high-torque motors while also powering various electronic components. As supply chains remain strained, manufacturers like Hero are now focused on finding workarounds to ensure production stability in the months ahead. The company reported a mixed June quarter. The two-wheeler major posted a flat net profit of Rs 1,126 crore for Q1FY26, marginally higher than Rs 1,123 crore in the same quarter last year, and ahead of estimates. A Moneycontrol poll of eight brokerages had pegged the net profit at Rs 1,054 crore. Chief Financial Officer Vivek Anand said profitability remained resilient, supported by healthy demand for entry-level and deluxe motorcycles and the 125cc scooter segment. He added that the company’s electric mobility business under the VIDA brand continued to gain momentum, while international operations outperformed the broader market. The company said it expects retail demand to remain strong in the coming quarters, aided by festive tailwinds and a robust pipeline of new product launches. At about 12:50 pm, shares of the company were trading at Rs 4,570, higher by 2.13 percent from the last close on the NSE. Hero MotoCorp shares have risen 18 percent in the last three months.

"From textile to shrimp stocks, Trump's twin tariffs leave Indian export stocks gasping",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/from-textile-to-shrimp-stocks-trump-s-twin-tariffs-leave-indian-export-stocks-gasping-13412295.html,"US President Donald Trump's double-tariff salvo hit Indian equity markets on August 7, triggering a sharp selloff in labor-intensive sectors such as textiles, seafood, and auto components. Market experts believe this pressure could linger, particularly in stocks with significant US exposure, until the tariff uncertainty clears or India's trade disadvantage narrows compared to competing nations. As per data, all three sectors – textile stocks, auto component makers, and shrimp exporters – felt the brunt of Trump's announcement. The initial 25 percent tariff was declared on July 31 and takes effect starting today. A second penalty of another 25 percent was announced shortly after, citing India’s ongoing purchases of Russian oil, which the US alleges fuels the war in Ukraine. This second blow also comes just before a planned US delegation visit to India in mid-August for the sixth round of trade negotiations. India's firm stand against opening its dairy and agricultural markets has irked US officials. While experts believe this could be a negotiation tactic, the twin tariffs, if fully enforced, risk bringing India-US trade to a virtual standstill. Here’s a breakdown of how sectoral and individual stocks are reacting to the tariff fallout: Gokaldas Exports Roughly 70 percent of Gokaldas Exports’ revenue comes from the US market. The fresh tariff increases the competitive gap between India and other textile exporting countries such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, and even Pakistan. Chandan Taparia, Senior Vice President at Motilal Oswal, noted that the stock is trading at its lowest level in fifteen months and has a weak structure for the upcoming sessions. He marked Rs 600 as a key support level. The company’s management said in its earnings call that they expect margin pressure in Q2 due to both tariffs and seasonal weakness. Assuming an average tariff of 20 percent across major exporting nations and a three times markup, the margin impact on end consumers could be 7 to 8 percent. However, the management expects the impact to be temporary and margins to normalise by early FY27. Welspun Living With 50 percent of its revenue coming from the US, Welspun Living has already reported an 11 percent decline in revenue in the June quarter due to tariff-related uncertainties. The company now plans to take a more conservative approach in Q2 and expects continued pressure on both margins and revenues. “Retailers and suppliers have taken a cautious stance, with inventory correction happening at the retail level. We expect demand to recover once there’s clarity on tariffs and revised cost structures,” the management said. Taparia of Motilal Oswal projected a potential downside of another 10 percent in the stock due to continued volatility. Pearl Global Pearl Global expects a margin dilution of 50 to 60 basis points in Q1FY26 on a quarter-on-quarter basis due to burden-sharing of tariffs. The company’s US revenue share has dropped significantly from around 85 percent in FY21 to approximately 48 percent now. Pearl Global absorbed around 2 percent of the tariff cost for its US clients and passed on the remainder down the value chain. However, management remains confident that its diversified manufacturing base across India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam will help soften the blow of US tariff volatility. Bharat Forge Bharat Forge derives around 40 to 45 percent of its revenue from the US. Analysts at YES Securities have cut their FY26 and FY27 earnings per share estimates by 11.5 percent and 5 percent, respectively. The analysts cited the dual impact of the new US tariffs and stricter emission regulations in North America as reasons for a cautious export outlook. While Q2FY26 is expected to remain muted, the company expects a recovery in the second half of FY26, largely driven by exports. Raja Venkatraman, co-founder of Neotrader sees support zone down 40 percent from current market price at Rs 680, with resistance placed around Rs 800. Sona BLW Around 30 to 35 percent of Sona BLW’s revenue is linked to the US market. Although global tariff wars and a weak macroeconomic outlook continue to present headwinds, the company’s decision to scale up production in Mexico could provide a buffer against these pressures, according to independent analyst Ambareesh Baliga. Technically, the stock is at its lowest level in four years. Taparia sees Rs 380 to Rs 400 as crucial support zones, compared to the current market price of Rs 435. Avanti feeds As of the March quarter last year, Avanti Feeds derived 77 percent of its revenue from the North American market. Indian shrimp exports are highly vulnerable to US policy decisions, with nearly 48 percent headed to the US. Taparia expects the stock structure to remain weak in the near term, with potential downside of up to 10 percent amid tariff-linked risks. Apex Frozen Foods In its March quarter investor presentation, Apex Frozen Foods revealed that 53 percent of its revenue comes from the United States. Currently, Indian shrimp exports to the US face an effective customs duty of 17.7 percent, including 5.7 percent countervailing duties and 1.8 percent anti-dumping duty. With Trump’s proposed additional tariffs, this could surge to 50 percent within 21 days. Venkatraman of Neotrader, said that the stock has near-term support at Rs 200 and resistance around Rs 230.

"Hero MotoCorp to stay within 14–16% margin band; near-term at lower end, says CFO",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/hero-motocorp-to-stay-within-14-16-margin-band-near-term-at-lower-end-says-cfo-13412444.html,"Hero MotoCorp expects its operating margins to stay within the 14–16 percent range, but will likely operate at the lower end of that band in the near term, Chief Financial Officer Vivek Anand said during the company’s Q1FY26 earnings call. Anand pointed out that while margins held steady at 14.4 percent in the June quarter despite softer volumes, some cost pressures may re-emerge as volumes pick up in the coming quarters. Still, he reaffirmed the company’s margin guidance and said Hero would manage costs prudently to stay within the stated range. Also read: NSDL rises 7%, extends post-listing gains to 13%; newly-listed Sri Lotus rises 4%, Laxmi India Finance falls 4% The company saw gross margin improve by 100 basis points year-on-year, aided by price hikes and a richer product mix. However, the gains were offset by adverse operating leverage due to lower revenues following a planned production cut in April. Operating expenses were slightly lower in absolute terms compared to the year-ago period, thanks to continued cost control measures. The company reported a mixed June quarter. The two-wheeler major posted a flat net profit of Rs 1,126 crore for Q1FY26, marginally higher than Rs 1,123 crore in the same quarter last year, and ahead of estimates. A Moneycontrol poll of eight brokerages had pegged the net profit at Rs 1,054 crore. Chief Financial Officer Vivek Anand said profitability remained resilient, supported by healthy demand for entry-level and deluxe motorcycles and the 125cc scooter segment. He added that the company’s electric mobility business under the VIDA brand continued to gain momentum, while international operations outperformed the broader market.

Its superior execution in insurance segment (insurance premium / revenue grew 11%/22% YoY in Q1) is notable. Upside risks may emanate from continued traction in SIP (38% of client base is yet to have any SIP scheme) and spike in insurance cross-sales. Higher mix of equity within AUM (96.7%) lends higher growth potential for Prudent vs. AMCs. Any MTM fall in AUM, rise in direct mix (AUM mix under direct plans has increased to 47.3% in Jun’25 vs 45% in Jun’24) and cut in commissions (both AMC and insurance) are additional risks. There is an increasing trend of commission rationalisation by AMCs. While Prudent can pass on the same to distributors, it is a risk considering the reduction in overall payout to distributors.

Trump's tariff threats: Indian Pharma is ready with a multi-pronged defence strategy,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/trump-s-tariff-threats-indian-pharma-is-ready-with-a-multi-pronged-defence-strategy-13411997.html,"India’s pharmaceutical industry is forming a multi-pronged strategy to shield itself from potential tariff shocks as US President Donald Trump escalates his trade offensive. The industry is not taking chances while drug formulations and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) remain exempt from the latest 25 percent additional tariff hike under the ongoing Section 232 investigation. “The recent executive order by the US Administration excludes the pharmaceutical sector from immediate tariff imposition,” said Sudarshan Jain, Secretary General of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance. “Generic medicines are important for affordable healthcare in the US and typically operate on razor-thin margins,” he said. The exemption, however, is temporary. The Section 232 probe—launched by the US Department of Commerce to assess whether pharma imports threaten national security—is expected to conclude by December 27, 2025, with a presidential decision due by March 2026. Strategic moves Indian drugmakers are responding with a mix of geographic diversification, supply chain resilience, acquisition of US assets, and are also tapping consultants to brace for a potential disruption despite the current exemption. For instance, Aurobindo Pharma recently acquired US-based Lannett Company for $250 million, while Syngene International picked up its first US biologics facility for $36.5 million. All these acquisitions are to meant to gain manufacturing foothold in the US, and probably get some shield from tariffs. Others like Natco Pharma, with a lion's share of revenues from the US, are diversifying. Last month, it acquired a 35.75 percent stake in Adcock Ingram Holdings Ltd, a South African pharmaceutical company, for approximately Rs 2,000 crore. This acquisition aims to expand Natco Pharma's footprint in the African market “Clearly, we want to diversify,” said Rajeev Nannapaneni, Vice Chairman and CEO of Natco Pharma. “We want to have a good geographical spread and strengthen our core business.” Alembic Pharmaceuticals, which derives over 30 percent of its revenue from the US, is pursuing backward integration, cost optimisation, and selective acquisitions. “There’s no playbook for this. We’re doing it ourselves—sourcing more from India, improving conversion costs, and building (supply chain) resilience,” said Managing Director Pranav Amin. Companies which don't have manufacturing footprint in the US, are looking at outsourcing to contract manufacturers in the US, like Senores Pharmaceuticals, which manufactures entirely in the US. The company says it remains insulated from tariff risks. Manufacturing in the US does comes with a cost, which would be difficult for generic companies that operate on 10-15 percent margins. Consultants step in Global consulting firms like Oliver Wyman are helping Indian pharma clients scenario-plan for tariff shocks. “Risk management is at the heart of what we do,” said Sumit Sharma, Partner and Head of Health & Life Sciences Practice in India. “Clients are asking us to come up with responses, so that they have a playbook ready.” Some of the strategies include China+1 sourcing strategies, digital analytics to improve plant throughput and yield operational cost-cutting, M&A targeting for growth and diversification. The Association for Accessible Medicines (AAM), which represents the US generic and biosimilar manufacturers, has warned that tariffs on generics would raise prices, worsen drug shortages, and threaten the viability of low-margin products. In 2023, generics accounted for 90 percent of US prescriptions and saved the healthcare system $445 billion. “Tariffs on generic medicines would significantly increase prescription drug prices,” AAM said in a recent fact sheet. “They would trigger unprecedented shortages and discourage onshoring.” India exported pharmaceuticals worth $8.73 billion to the US in 2024, accounting for 31 percent of its total pharma exports. Indian generics make up nearly half of all drugs covered by Medicare and commercial insurance plans. For now, the industry is watching Washington closely—hoping that economic logic and healthcare realities will outweigh protectionist impulses.","Companies which don't have manufacturing footprint in the US, are looking at outsourcing to contract manufacturers in the US, like Senores Pharmaceuticals, which manufactures entirely in the US.","Companies which don't have manufacturing footprint in the US, are looking at outsourcing to contract manufacturers in the US, like Senores Pharmaceuticals, which manufactures entirely in the US.",India’s pharmaceutical industry is forming a multi-pronged strategy to shield itself from potential tariff shocks as US President Donald Trump escalates his trade offensive.,"Companies which don't have manufacturing footprint in the US, are looking at outsourcing to contract manufacturers in the US, like Senores Pharmaceuticals, which manufactures entirely in the US.",neutral,0.6480093598365784

The shares of the Tata Group company were trading at Rs 5,440 apiece. Trent Ltd, which operates the apparel stores Zudio and Westside, reported a net profit of Rs 423 crore for the April-June quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a 24 percent on-year rise from the Rs 342 crore net profit reported in the year-ago period. The Tata Group company's revenue from operations meanwhile rose 20 percent on-year to Rs 4,781 crore in Q1 FY26, as against Rs 3,992 crore in Q1 FY25. The consolidated profit rose 9 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 429.7 crore, excluding the exceptional items impact. The Operating EBIT margin for Q1 FY26 stood at 11.4 percent, as against 10.6 percent in Q1 FY25. Should you buy, sell or hold? Motilal Oswal retained its 'Buy' rating on the stock, but reduced its target price to Rs 6,400 apiece. This implies an upside potential of around 19.5 percent from the stock's previous closing price of Rs 5,356 apiece. The domestic brokerage noted that the company delivered a strong EBITDA growth of approximately 37 percent on-year, beating its estimate by around 17 percent, despite a continued deceleration in revenue growth and sharp decline in gross margin. ""The significant margin beat was led by effective cost control—employee expenses fell 7% YoY, while rental costs rose only 7% YoY, despite a 36% increase in retail area, reflecting the strength of Trent’s variable cost structure,"" Motilal Oswal said, while noting that its Star business underperformed with just 7 percent on-year revenue growth, flat like-for-like sales, and a 14 percent on-year drop in revenue per square feet. ""We continue to like Trent for its robust footprint additions, strong double digit growth, long runway for growth in Star (presence in just 10 cities), and potential scale-up of emerging categories (Beauty, Innerwear, Footwear, and LGDs). However, revenue growth acceleration remains a key trigger,"" it added. Bernstein has an 'Outperform' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 6,500 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 21 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage however, also highlighted the slowing growth in revenue and significant reduction in revenue per square feet, CNBC-TV18 reported. Citi kept an 'Buy' rating on the stock, but reduced its target price to Rs 7,150 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 33 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage noted that while the revenue growth slowed down, it is still ahead of the other discretionary players, according to the note cited by the business channel. Nuvama Institutional Equities maintained its 'Hold' rating on the stock, but reduced its target price to Rs 5,850 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 9 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The brokerage said that the Tata Group company delivered strong margin improvement despite lower productivity. Trent share price history: The shares of the company later pared some gains to trade nearly 1 percent higher at Rs 5,396.50 apiece. The stock has gained nearly 8 percent in the past five days, but dropped nearly 2 percent in the past one month. It currently has a P/E ratio of around 125.

"Sensex falls for third straight day, Nifty below 24,550 as Trump threatens additional 25% tariff",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-falls-for-third-straight-day-nifty-below-24-550-as-trump-threatens-additional-25-tariff-13410906.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex slipped for a third session in a row on August 7 after US President Donald Trump announced plans to double tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent. However, markets may find some temporary relief as the fresh 25 percent levy comes with a 21-day window, giving India a brief opportunity to negotiate a trade deal. At about 9:25 am, the Sensex was down 209.33 points or 0.26 percent at 80,334.66, and the Nifty was down 64.15 points or 0.26 percent at 24,510.05. About 910 shares advanced, 1793 shares declined, and 122 shares were unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates ""The 21-day window before the additional 25 percent US tariff takes effect offers India a chance to negotiate and potentially strike a deal. However, the broader trade outlook remains clouded by uncertainty, with little clarity on how far either side is willing to compromise. President Trump, buoyed by recent trade wins with other partners like the EU, is unlikely to back down from his hardline — and arguably unjustified — stance."" V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited, said. ""For India, the challenge is greater, as the US holds the upper hand in negotiations. So far, India’s response has been measured and pragmatic. While markets are unlikely to panic immediately, sentiment is expected to remain weak in the near term amid lingering trade tensions."" he added. Among individual stocks, Bajaj Auto slipped as much as 4 percent on August 7 after the company reported a 14 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 2,210.44 crore for the fiscal first quarter of FY26. Revenue from operations climbed to Rs 13,133.35 crore in Q1 FY26, marking a 10 percent increase from the same quarter last year. Bernstein and CLSA have given outperform rating on the counter. Shares of lifestyle retailer Trent rose 1 percent after the company reported a 9 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in consolidated net profit to Rs 425 crore for Q1FY26, compared to Rs 391 crore in the same quarter last year. Revenue rose 19 percent YoY to Rs 4,883 crore from Rs 4,104 crore. Domestic brokerages Motilal Oswal and Avendus Spark have given buy ratings. Two-wheeler major Hero MotoCorp rose nearly 2 percent after it reported a flat net profit at Rs 1,126 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 as against Rs 1,123 crore a year ago. However, the firm beat estimates as a Moneycontrol poll of eight brokerage firms pegged the net profit at Rs 1,054 crore. Hero's revenue declined 5.5 percent to Rs 9,579 crore in Q1FY26 as against Rs 10,144 crore in Q1FY25. Technical View The Nifty continues to trade within a tightly knit consolidation range of 24,500–24,750, as evidenced by successive small-bodied candles on the daily chart. A directional breakout from this band will likely dictate the next phase of market momentum. Until then, the Nifty may continue its sideways to choppy trajectory. The 100-day exponential moving average (100-DEMA), currently near 24,595, has consistently acted as a support threshold. However, a decisive breakdown below the 24,535–24,500 zone could trigger further downside toward 24,300–24,250. On the upside, immediate resistance is seen around 24,760, coinciding with the 10-DEMA. Unless the index convincingly reclaims this level, any rebound is expected to encounter selling pressure. Hero MotoCorp, Trent, Cipla, Bajaj Finserv, and Tech Mahindra were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Tata Motors, Kotak Mahindra, Jio Financial Services, Coal India, and Tata Steel.

However, markets may find some temporary relief as the fresh 25 percent levy comes with a 21-day window, giving India a brief opportunity to negotiate a trade deal. At about 7:45 pm, the Gift Nifty was at 24,552, lower by 0.32 percent. After a choppy intraday session, bears drove Dalal Street into the red on August 6, as the Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee's decision failed to support the benchmark indices. Further, investors decided to trim exposure to the equity markets as U.S. President Trump's repeated tariff threats roiled sentiment. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) were net sellers to the tune of Rs 4,999 crore worth of shares in Indian equities, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) net bought Rs 6,794 crore worth of shares, according to provisional NSE data. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session The Nifty continues to trade within a tightly knit consolidation range of 24,500–24,750, as evidenced by successive small-bodied candles on the daily chart. A directional breakout from this band will likely dictate the next phase of market momentum. Until then, the Nifty may continue its sideways to choppy trajectory. The 100-day exponential moving average (100-DEMA), currently near 24,595, has consistently acted as a support threshold. However, a decisive breakdown below the 24,535–24,500 zone could trigger further downside toward 24,300–24,250. On the upside, immediate resistance is seen around 24,760, coinciding with the 10-DEMA. Unless the index convincingly reclaims this level, any rebound is expected to encounter selling pressure. Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities says that the Nifty Bank index is yet to stage a meaningful breakout, despite a Bullish Harami pattern forming on the daily chart. A reversal will only be confirmed if it closes above 55,700. Minor upticks continue to face selling pressure, keeping the trend weak. The index remains stretched below its short-term averages, with the 10-day EMA near 55,900 and the 20-day EMA around 56,200 acting as key resistance. On the downside, support lies at 55,100–55,000. A breach below this could trigger further selling toward 54,500–54,300, he added. India VIX rose marginally by 2.11 percent to close at 11.96. Despite upcoming macro triggers, volatility remains subdued and anchored near the 11 mark—suggesting that the broader market is currently pricing in consolidation rather than a steep correction. This implies that while caution prevails, panic has not yet taken hold. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) has sharply declined from 0.72 to 0.60, highlighting growing bearish sentiment and a clear dominance of call sellers.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade IndiGo, Asian Paints, Waaree Energies, Jindal Stainless, CSB Bank, Bajaj Finance and others on August 7?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-indigo-asian-paints-waaree-energies-jindal-stainless-csb-bank-bajaj-finance-and-others-on-august-7-13409033.html,"The benchmark indices remained under pressure for the second consecutive session, with the Nifty 50 down 0.3 percent on August 7. Bears maintained dominance in market breadth, with about 1,988 shares declining compared to 697 advancing on the NSE. The bearish sentiment is expected to prevail, given the weakness in technical indicators. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Nilesh Jain, Head – Technical and Derivatives Research Analyst (Equity Research) at Centrum Broking InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo) | CMP: Rs 5,893.5 InterGlobe Aviation remains in a strong uptrend, consistently taking support at its 50-DMA (currently at Rs 5,681) and along its rising trendline. It is on the verge of a breakout from a falling channel pattern, and a successful breakout could trigger a fresh rally towards new all-time highs. We expect the stock to surpass resistance and head towards the Rs 6,300 level in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,300 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,680 Asian Paints | CMP: Rs 2,491.2 Asian Paints is forming a strong base and is on the verge of a multi-month breakout above the Rs 2,530 level. It is trading comfortably above all key short-term and long-term moving averages. Additionally, momentum indicators and oscillators on the daily chart have confirmed a bullish crossover. Based on this setup, we anticipate the stock to move towards the gap area near Rs 2,700 in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,700 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,390 Sun Pharmaceutical Industries | CMP: Rs 1,595.2 Sun Pharmaceutical has broken down from a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart, signaling potential downside. Additionally, the MACD has triggered a sell crossover, reinforcing the bearish outlook. It is currently trading well below all key short-term and long-term moving averages. Given these factors, further weakness is likely in the near term, and a sell-on-rise approach is advisable. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 1,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,649 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities Waaree Energies | CMP: Rs 3,218.4 Waaree Energies has recently found strong support near its 50-day EMA, which acted as a springboard for a fresh upward move. Following this rebound, the price action has been gradually inching higher and is now approaching a critical juncture — a potential breakout above a downward-sloping trendline on the daily chart. Notably, Wednesday’s trading session witnessed volume activity that surpassed the 50-day average, indicating early signs of accumulation. This surge in participation suggests that market participants may be positioning themselves ahead of a possible breakout, adding conviction to the bullish setup. From a trend perspective, the stock is trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages, which are aligned in a bullish sequence and trending upward — a classic sign of strength and trend continuation. This confluence of price, volume, and momentum indicators points toward a constructive technical structure, with the potential for a breakout-led rally in the near term. Hence, we recommend buying this stock above the breakout level of Rs 3,270. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,520 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,140 Jindal Stainless | CMP: Rs 734 Jindal Stainless has recently witnessed a breakout from a downward-sloping trendline on the daily chart, signalling a potential continuation of its upward trajectory. Post-breakout, the price has been gradually trending higher, supported by relatively higher volumes — a classic indication of sustained buying interest and accumulation. Currently, the stock is trading above its key moving averages, which reinforces the bullish undertone. Momentum indicators are also aligning with the bullish narrative. The RSI is firmly positioned in the bullish zone and continues to rise, reflecting improving price strength. Meanwhile, the MACD remains in positive territory, quoting above both its signal line and the zero line. The MACD histogram is expanding, suggesting a pickup in upside momentum and further validating the breakout. Overall, the confluence of price action, volume behaviour, and momentum indicators points to a strong technical setup, with potential for continued upward movement in the sessions ahead. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the Rs 730–740 range. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 800 Stop-Loss: Rs 700 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities CSB Bank | CMP: Rs 435.2 CSB Bank has recently given a strong closing above its key resistance zone of Rs 420, supported by a bullish RSI crossover, indicating strengthening momentum. The major trend remains positive, with a structure of higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart and a steady rally visible on the weekly chart. It is also sustaining above its 20-day EMA, reinforcing the bullish sentiment. With a favourable risk-reward setup, the stock can be considered for buying at Rs 434.

"Bajaj Auto warns of demand, supply challenges from ABS mandate on entry-level bikes",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/bajaj-auto-warns-of-demand-supply-challenges-from-abs-mandate-on-entry-level-bikes-13406185.html,"Bajaj Auto has flagged supply chain and cost hurdles stemming from the government’s proposal to make anti-lock braking systems (ABS) mandatory for all two-wheelers from January 1, 2026. The regulation, aimed at enhancing road safety, is expected to particularly impact motorcycles in the 100–125cc segment, which currently use the more affordable combined braking system (CBS). Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director at Bajaj Auto, said the transition would put “huge requirements” on the supply chain. “It could take anywhere between 12 to 24 months to get the supply chain ready if every single two-wheeler has to be equipped with ABS,” Sharma said during the company’s post-earnings call for the first quarter on August 6. Also read: Bajaj Auto halves EV output amid rare earth crunch, races to secure alternative supplies While acknowledging the need for improved rider safety, Sharma warned that the cost implications of such a shift could weigh on consumer sentiment. “We struggle to cut even Rs 500 from the cost. If prices go up sharply due to ABS, it will dampen demand—especially in the entry-level segment,” he said. Sharma pointed out that the Indian two-wheeler industry has yet to recover to its FY19 peak levels, with one of the key reasons being successive cost escalations triggered by regulatory changes, insurance costs, and other compliance burdens. The proposed ABS mandate, he noted, risks repeating that cycle at a time when rural and value-conscious buyers are still cautious. However, there appears to be room for negotiation. Sharma said the government is in active dialogue with industry players and has asked for additional data to evaluate alternatives. “They are open to understanding other options that may be more cost-effective and still improve safety. Those conversations are ongoing,” he added. The auto sector is already navigating multiple challenges, including a supply crunch of heavy rare earth magnets used in electric vehicles. Any further regulatory burden, especially on the cost-sensitive end of the market, could deepen headwinds. Read more: Modi to visit China: Trump’s tariff war bringing rivals together?

"Bajaj Auto halves EV output amid rare earth crunch, races to secure alternative supplies",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/bajaj-auto-halves-ev-output-amid-rare-earth-crunch-races-to-secure-alternative-supplies-13405296.html,"Bajaj Auto has slashed production of its electric two-wheelers by up to 50 percent in July as a deepening global shortage of heavy rare earth magnets disrupts supply chains. The automaker expects output to remain constrained in the coming months, with August and September also likely to see production at just over half the planned levels, Bajaj Auto said in its post-earnings conference call on August 6. The supply crunch stems from China's suspension of magnet exports since April. As the dominant player in the rare earth space—accounting for 60 percent of global production and 90 percent of refining—China’s pause has sent shockwaves through the auto industry, particularly electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers that rely heavily on these components. Also read: Hero MotoCorp Q1 net profit flat at Rs 1,126 crore, but beats estimates ""Non-availabilities have begun to compromise production in June itself, resulting in some shortfalls in deliveries to dealers in June. July has seen a 50 percent shortfall. While we expect production in August to be better than July, we may still see a shortfall of similar levels of 50 percent in this quarter in Chetak and about 25 percent to 30 percent or so in E autos,"" Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director and Chief Technology Officer, said. ""Multiple options, both short-term and long-term term are being pursued at the same time, ranging from simply working with authorities to reopen the flows of HRE magnet as well as to developing alternate sources and alternatives to HRE-based components,"" he added. Rare earth magnets are crucial in EVs, enabling high-performance motors in compact spaces and powering critical electronics. The shortage has not only forced Bajaj Auto to cut output but also weighed on overall industry sales. In July, the company—India’s second-largest electric two-wheeler maker—saw registrations dip 15 percent month-on-month to 19,650 units. Read more: Modi to visit China: Trump’s tariff war bringing rivals together? To prevent further disruption, Bajaj Auto has been quick to adapt. The company is now exploring two parallel tracks: replacing heavy rare earth magnets with more easily available light rare earth variants and developing entirely new technologies that bypass rare earths altogether.

M&B Engineering shares ended with 6 percent after listing flat at the issue price. Outlook for August 7 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty remained bearish throughout the day as the index stayed under selling pressure, holding below the 50EMA throughout the session. The RSI continued to display a bearish crossover on both the daily and hourly charts. In addition, a lower-top, lower-bottom formation has developed on the hourly chart, indicating a weakening trend. The index is likely to remain a “sell on rise” as long as it stays below 24,850. In the short term, the index may trend downwards towards 24,400, which is expected to act as a crucial support level on a sustained or closing basis. If Nifty sustains below 24,400, it is likely to witness a more serious correction. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities The choppy movement continued in the market on Wednesday and the RBI's mid quarter policy outcome has failed to lift the sentiment in the market, as Nifty closed the day lower by 75 points. After opening with a flat note, the market slipped into sharp weakness in the early part of the session. There was a minor recovery in the mid part and the market finally closed near the lows. A small negative candle was formed on the daily chart which indicates a narrow range movement in Nifty over the last few sessions near the crucial support of 24500 levels. This is not a good sign and suggests that the said support could eventually be broken decisively on the downside in the near term. The underlying trend of Nifty continues to be weak amidst choppy movement. A sharp breakdown of the support of 24500 could trigger quick decline down to the next support of 24200 levels (200day EMA). Immediate resistance placed at 24800. Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Chairman and Managing Director BN Kalyani said, ""Given the recent tariff announcement by the US government and changes to emission regulation in North America, we are cautious on the outlook for the US export business for the reminder of the fiscal. FY26 is likely to be a challenging period, given where we are in the overall cycle and our geographical exposure."" ""During the quarter, the company faced challenging market conditions in our export markets caused by tariff & regulatory uncertainties,"" said Kalyani, adding that the management plans to capture opportunities in businesses and geographies that are 'relatively unaffected', and will work towards cost optimization, going forward. Shares of Bharat Forge have been under pressure, slipping to day's low after the earnings and management comments. The company posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 284 crore, which is lower by 13 percent on year, while the revenue fell 4.8 percent on year at Rs 3,909 crore. The margin came in at 17.2 percent compared to 18.1 percent a year ago.

"Asian shares are mostly lower, while Tokyo's Nikkei jumps 2%",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-are-mostly-lower-while-tokyos-nikkei-jumps-2-2025-08-08/,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Asian shares were mostly lower Friday while Tokyo’s benchmark jumped more than 2% after Japanese officials said they had resolved questions over the tariff that will apply to exports to the U.S. The new U.S. tariffs on Japanese goods that took effect Thursday did not match an agreement between Washington and Tokyo on a 15% level, and Japan’s main trade envoy said the U.S. side had agreed to correct the problem. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo gained 2.2% to 41,977.65 and is close to a record level. Toyota Motor Corp. jumped 3.9% and Honda Motor Co. was up 4%. Automakers are among the manufacturers with the most at stake regarding exports to the U.S. Elsewhere in Asia, most markets slipped following declines on Wall Street. Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 0.7% to 24,916.15, while the Shanghai Composite index inched up less than 0.1% to 3,642.10. South Korea's Kospi slipped 0.7% to 3,206.86. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.2% to 8,813.70. Taiwan's Taiex gained 0.2% and the Sensex in India was down 0.5%. “We’re heading into a stretch where markets will punish certainty. The momentum winds are shapeshifters—what looks like a slam dunk on Monday can turn into a face plant by Friday,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. On Thursday, the S&P 500 edged 0.1% lower and the Dow industrials dipped 0.5%. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.3% to a record as shares in Apple and some computer chip makers soared. Intel sank 3.1% after Trump called for its CEO to resign, while accusing him of being “highly CONFLICTED,” though he gave no evidence. But Apple rose 3.2% after its CEO Tim Cook joined Trump at the White House on Wednesday to say it’s increasing its investment in U.S. manufacturing by an additional $100 billion over the next four years. Computer chip makers with big investments or manufacturing capacity in the U.S. surged higher after Trump ordered 100% tariffs on imported semiconductors but said companies with big U.S. investments would be exempt. Shares in Advanced Micro Devices jumped 5.7% and Nvidia gained 0.8%. A worse-than-expected report on the U.S. jobs market last week added to worries that President Donald Trump's tariffs are damaging the economy. But hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve and a torrent of stronger-than-expected profit reports from big U.S. companies are helping to offset those concerns. Lower interest rates can give the economy and investment prices a boost, though the downside is that they can also push inflation higher at a time when tariffs are also pushing prices up. The Bank of England cut its main interest rate on Thursday in hopes of bolstering the sluggish U.K. economy.

Why Monolithic Power's Earnings and Guidance Ignited a Rally,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-monolithic-powers-earnings-and-guidance-ignited-a-rally/,"Following its July 31st earnings announcement, shares of Monolithic Power Systems NASDAQ: MPWR jumped more than 10% in a single session on unusually high trading volume. In the first few trading sessions of early August 2025, Monolitic Power’s stock price seemingly stabilized, holding on to an approximate 13% overall gain. Such a decisive move up in a company’s stock price is rarely arbitrary. In this case, it directly responded to a rock-solid quarterly report. More importantly, it was also a response to powerful forward-looking guidance that confirmed the company’s essential role in one of the technology sector’s most demanding and fastest-growing departments: The hardware infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI). The results demonstrated accelerating business momentum, providing investors with a data-driven look into how the company is capitalizing on the insatiable energy needs of modern data centers. For investors, a company's ability not only to surpass past expectations but also to raise future forecasts is a strong bullish signal known as a beat and raise. It shows solid execution and management's confidence in the company's ongoing momentum. Monolithic Power delivered on both aspects in its second-quarter 2025 report. This impressive financial performance is tied directly to a fundamental technological shift. The immense computational power required for AI models has created a critical challenge in data centers: energy consumption. Modern AI accelerators, such as GPUs and custom ASICs, are highly power-hungry, generating significant heat and straining the power delivery infrastructure of even the most advanced facilities. This is where Monolithic Power Systems (MPS) has established a key advantage. During its earnings call, management provided the missing link for investors, confirming it had begun ""initial shipments of our power solutions to support our customers' new ASIC-based AI products."" This statement solidifies the company’s position as a direct beneficiary of the AI hardware buildout and provides context for the remarkable growth in its Storage & Computing business segment, which surged 70.0% year-over-year. MPS does not just sell components; it provides highly integrated and efficient power modules that solve this energy bottleneck. Its proprietary technology allows for higher power density, meaning more power can be delivered cleanly and efficiently in a smaller physical space. These solutions are mission-critical for data center operators trying to maximize computing power without overhauling their entire infrastructure, making MPS a key enabler of the entire AI ecosystem. Following the earnings release, Wall Street analysts were quick to validate the market's enthusiastic reaction. The strong results and optimistic guidance prompted a wave of positive revisions, reinforcing the company's bullish thesis. Firms including Citigroup, Stifel Nicolaus, and KeyCorp all raised their price targets on Monolithic Power Systems’ (MPS) shares, with many reiterating Buy or Outperform ratings. This chorus of approval from financial experts signals a growing belief that the company’s strategic execution is not only on point but accelerating, driven by the durable demand from the AI sector. This confidence is further reflected in the company's ownership structure. Over 93% of Monolithic Power's stock is currently being held by institutional investors. This high level of ownership by large financial entities, such as mutual funds and pension funds, indicates a deep and widespread conviction in the company’s long-term strategy and execution. It suggests that major investors who perform extensive due diligence see a sustainable growth path, providing a stable foundation for the company's strategic initiatives. Monolithic Power Systems' second-quarter performance was more than a strong earnings report; it confirmed a strategic success. The powerful combination of a definitive financial beat, firm forward guidance, and a direct link to the explosive growth in AI infrastructure provides a clear picture of a company firing on all cylinders. The market's decisive rally acknowledged this fundamental reality. While high growth expectations are often priced into technology stocks, the company delivered the data to back them up. The results signal a strategic inflection point where Monolithic Power is cementing its role as an essential supplier for the AI revolution, effectively turning the immense energy needs of the buildout into robust and accelerating financial growth.

Trump defends the US economy with charts after job reports showed warning signs,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-defends-the-us-economy-with-charts-after-job-reports-showed-warning-signs-2025-08-07/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump unexpectedly summoned reporters to the Oval Office on Thursday to present them with charts that he says show the U.S. economy is solid following a jobs report last week that raised red flags and led to the Republican firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Joining Trump to talk about the economy was Stephen Moore, a senior visiting fellow in economics at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, and the co-author of the 2018 book “ Trumponomics.” Flipping through a series of charts on an easel, Moore sought to elevate Trump's performance as president and diminish the economic track record of former President Joe Biden. Trump stood next to Moore and interjected with approvals. The moment in the Oval Office spoke to the president's hopes to reset the narrative of the U.S. economy. While the stock market has been solid, job growth has turned sluggish and inflationary pressures have risen in the wake of Trump imposing a vast set of new tariffs, which are taxes on imports. Moore said he phoned Trump because he put together some data that shows he was correct to dismiss Erika McEntarfer as the head of the BLS. He noted that’s because reports from the BLS had overestimated the number of jobs created during the last two years of Biden’s term by 1.5 million. “I think they did it purposely,” said Trump, who has yet to offer statistical evidence backing his theory. Revisions are a standard component of jobs reports and tend to be larger during periods of economic disruption. The economy has seldom conformed to the whims of any president, often presenting pictures that are far more mixed and nuanced than what can easily be sold to voters. Through the first seven months of this year, employers have added 597,000 jobs, down roughly 44% from the gains during the same period in 2024. The July jobs report showed that just 73,000 jobs were added last month, while the May and June totals were revised downward by 258,000. While Biden did face downward revisions on his job numbers, the economy added 2 million jobs in 2024 and 2.6 million in 2023. The fundamental challenge in Biden's economy was the jolt of inflation as the annual rate of the consumer price index hit a four-decade high in June 2022. That level of inflation left many households feeling as though groceries, gasoline, housing and other essentials were unaffordable, a sentiment that helped to return Trump to the White House in the 2024 election. There are signs of inflation heating back up under Trump because of his tariffs. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs estimated that the upcoming inflation report for July will show that consumer prices rose 3% over the past 12 months, which would be up from a 2.3% reading in April. Trump promised that he could galvanize a boom. And when nonpartisan data has indicated something closer to a muddle, he found an advocate in Moore, whom he nominated to serve as a Federal Reserve governor during his first term. Moore withdrew his name after facing pushback in the Senate. Moore said that through the first five months of Trump's second term in office that “the average median household income adjusted for inflation and for the average family in America, is already up $1,174.” Moore said his numbers are based on unpublished Census Bureau data, which can make them difficult to independently verify. “That’s an incredible number,” Trump said. ""If I would have said this, nobody would have believed it.""

Closure of Midwest-based newspaper chain leaves dozens of communities without a news source,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/closure-of-midwest-based-newspaper-chain-leaves-dozens-of-communities-without-a-news-source-2025-08-07/,"SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — Dozens of communities in the Midwest and West learned Thursday they had lost their newspapers after an Illinois-based publisher announced it would abruptly close because of financial problems. News Media Corp., which owns local newspapers across five states, said it will close 14 operations in Wyoming, seven in Illinois, five in Arizona, four in South Dakota and one in Nebraska. Touting itself as “the voice of small town America,” NMC's closure affects longtime newspapers that were often the primary source of news in numerous small towns, worsening the problem of news deserts in rural areas. The closure follows a decades-long pattern of financial challenges for local newspapers — the U.S. has lost over one-third of its print newspapers and two-thirds of its newspaper journalists since 2004 as the news media has struggled to adopt to a changing readership and revenue landscape, according to the Medill Local News Initiative at Northwestern University. “Unfortunately, due to financial challenges, a significant economic downturn impacting our industry, revenue losses and increasing expenses, and the recent failure of an attempt to sell the company as a going concern, we have reached a point where continuing business is no longer feasible,” company CEO J.J. Tompkins wrote in a letter to staff Wednesday. News Media Corp. is based in Rochelle, Illinois. Hundreds of employees were terminated immediately, and Tompkins wrote that the company will make “reasonable efforts to pay you all remaining compensation you have earned.” Staff took to social media to express their shock and disappointment at the news. “No one in Huron, nor any of the other papers, knew this was coming today,” Benjamin Chase, managing editor of the Huron Plainsman in South Dakota, said in a social media post. “We’re all in shock and attempting to figure out how to move forward.” Josh Linehan, managing editor of the Brookings Register in South Dakota, wrote in a letter to readers, “It’s no secret that it’s tough times out there for all print media, and we’re no exception."" He added, “But make no mistake — we’re closed for now as a result of poor corporate management.” News Media Corp. did not return a request for comment. Brookings Mayor Ope Niemeyer said the closure of his town’s newspaper “absolutely” leaves a big hole in the community. He said it’s devastating for the newspaper’s employees and disadvantages the city, County Commission and other local boards that used the newspaper for legal notices. Less than a year ago, Brookings lost the news on its local radio station, which left just the newspaper, now gone, he said. “Obviously we all have websites and Facebook and LinkedIn and Instagram and all that, but there’s a generation that doesn’t use that,” said Niemeyer, who at 65 prefers a printed newspaper. He liked the newspaper’s commentary for fostering conversations. The reporters did a great job telling readers what was going on in Brookings, a city of about 25,000 people, he said. “It brings the community together,” the mayor said. “It’s an entity that’s going to be irreplaceable.” The reasons behind newspaper closures are complex, with multiple factors at play, said Teri Finneman, a professor at the University of Kansas' journalism school and publisher of The Eudora Times. The newspaper industry is using a business model that is two centuries old and unsustainable in 2025, she said. The public also has greater reluctance to pay for local news, too few subscribers are paying too low rates and a lack of social cohesion in the U.S. has led to fracturing and mistrust in news, Finneman said. This has been coupled with declining populations in many rural areas and corporate ownership that often is unfamiliar with running such papers, she said. “This really needs to be a wake-up call to every town in this nation that your newspaper could be at risk as well and it is incumbent upon people to start supporting their newspapers through subscriptions and through advertising if we are going to keep critical news in these communities,” Finneman said. On Thursday, the Sioux Falls-based Dakota Scout newspaper said it plans to expand coverage in Brookings in response to the closures. ___ Dura reported from Bismarck, North Dakota.","“We’re all in shock and attempting to figure out how to move forward.” Josh Linehan, managing editor of the Brookings Register in South Dakota, wrote in a letter to readers, “It’s no secret that it’s tough times out there for all print media, and we’re no exception.""","“We’re all in shock and attempting to figure out how to move forward.” Josh Linehan, managing editor of the Brookings Register in South Dakota, wrote in a letter to readers, “It’s no secret that it’s tough times out there for all print media, and we’re no exception.""","The public also has greater reluctance to pay for local news, too few subscribers are paying too low rates and a lack of social cohesion in the U.S. has led to fracturing and mistrust in news, Finneman said.","The closure follows a decades-long pattern of financial challenges for local newspapers — the U.S. has lost over one-third of its print newspapers and two-thirds of its newspaper journalists since 2004 as the news media has struggled to adopt to a changing readership and revenue landscape, according to the Medill Local News Initiative at Northwestern University.",negative,0.9701860547065735
"AppLovin’s Q2 Miss Spooks Market, But Wall Street Doubles Down",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/applovins-q2-miss-spooks-market-but-wall-street-doubles-down/,"Over the past 52 weeks, AppLovin NASDAQ: APP has been one of the biggest stock market standouts. As of the Aug. 6 close, shares have surged by a whopping 446%. The company has an incredibly strong record of delivering impressive earnings. Shares have gained by 12% or more the day following its last six earnings releases. But, investors seemed to hit the panic button after seeing AppLovin’s Q2 2025 results, released on Aug. 6. Within minutes of the release, shares plunged around 13% in after-hours trading. However, as investors further digested the results and management commentary, worries subsided considerably. By 10 PM EST, shares were down 5.5% in extended trading. Then, in a massive shift, shares gained by more than 10% midday on Aug. 7 as the rest of the market provided its take on the results. So, what are the key details from AppLovin’s earnings, and what is the outlook for this gangbusters stock going forward? Let’s dive in to get to the bottom of these questions. Note that the company’s Q2 results only consider its advertising segment. On June 30, AppLovin sold its Apps business and excludes its results from the Q2 report. In Q2, AppLovin reported revenues of approximately $1.26 billion, an increase of 77% versus Q2 2024. According to MarketBeat estimates, this figure fell short of the $1.37 billion Wall Street was looking for. Notably, that 77% rate was the highest growth figure the company’s advertising business posted over the past five quarters. The company’s bottom-line results were a different story. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $2.26, substantially higher than the $2.05 estimate. The figure marked a massive 163% spike versus the prior year's quarter. The company’s guidance for Q3 also came in moderately better than expected. AppLovin’s sale of its Apps segment drove one of its key intended results: massively lifting the margins of the overall business. AppLovin achieved an EBITDA margin of 81%, compared to 67.7% in Q1 2025 when the company included the Apps business in the results. AppLovin also posted an incredible free cash flow margin of just under 61%. Excluding the Apps business, this gives the firm a last-12-months free cash flow margin of 66%. That’s the highest figure of any large-cap U.S. stock in the software industry over that period. It’s also higher than any stock in the Magnificent Seven. AppLovin dominates advertising in mobile gaming, but it sees huge potential in the much larger e-commerce market. Last quarter, the firm provided the first key data around its e-commerce push, stating that it had achieved an annual run rate of $1 billion with around 600 customers. In Q2, AppLovin didn’t provide any new numbers around the e-commerce push, which likely disappointed investors initially. However, it did provide key details on why that was the case and clarified the timeline going forward. AppLovin said it intentionally constrained the advertiser onboarding process in e-commerce to make its product better. The stock’s price action on Aug. 7 shows that although this wasn’t the best news, it certainly wasn’t a reason for investors to panic. AppLovin is entering a massive new market. To achieve sustained success, making sure its product is high-quality is much more important than moving quickly. The company said it plans to begin onboarding again on Oct. 1. However, new customers will require a referral from an existing customer to join, meaning the rollout will still be somewhat measured. A full rollout will begin in the first half of 2026. Based on this information, investors might not get a huge amount of new data on AppLovin’s e-commerce push until its Q1 2026 earnings release. The company says it is less than 1% penetrated in e-commerce in terms of the number of advertisers it works with. This highlights the huge opportunity it has going forward. Overall, AppLovin didn’t announce anything groundbreaking in Q2. Thus, for a stock that has risen so much, it wasn’t surprising to see shares fall after-hours. However, its enormous e-commerce opportunity still remains, and analysts are bullish on the stock. Morgan Stanley and Piper Sandler raised their price targets to $480 and $500, respectively, on Aug. 7. These numbers imply significant upside potential in shares going forward. They highlight how AppLovin could experience strong gains in 2026 if its e-commerce business really takes off.

Worries are high that Trump’s tariffs are damaging the economy, particularly after last week’s worse-than-expected report on the job market.

Microsoft Stock Gains as Analysts Boost Price Targets,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/microsoft-stock-gains-as-analysts-boost-price-targets/,"Microsoft Corporation NASDAQ: MSFT delivered an earnings report that can be considered a blowout, even for a mega-cap company with high expectations. Microsoft beat on revenue and earnings and reiterated its guidance for data center spending for the remainder of the 2025 calendar year. Analysts have taken notice. The Microsoft analyst forecasts on MarketBeat show that nearly two dozen analysts have either reiterated or raised their price target for MSFT stock. Many of the new targets are above the consensus price of $609.86, which is a 15% gain from the stock’s price on August 6. August is a tricky month for investors. Apart from a few names like NVIDIA, the major technology stocks have already reported. The economy continues to give off conflicting signals, and Congress is out on recess, which generally leads to a less active market. This is a good reminder of why buying the best matters. In the tech sector, that means Microsoft. The company’s stock has been up about 2.8% since the earnings report, but that’s down from the 5% gain it had before a slight pullback this week. Earnings reports provide a snapshot of a company’s performance. However, the headline numbers are lagging indicators. In other words, they tell what’s happened in the past. What a company has to say about the current and future quarters can drive up a stock price. For a mega-cap company like Microsoft, that usually comes down to its earnings outlook. Analysts project Microsoft to post 12.3% earnings growth in the next 12 months. That compares favorably to another mega-cap hyperscaler, Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META, which analysts project to post 13.15% earnings growth. That aligns with the company’s guidance for “double-digit earnings growth on a constant currency basis.” However, it also means that analysts are slightly more bullish about earnings expectations for Microsoft, which largely explains the outlook for 15% stock price growth. Microsoft emphasized that its projected future growth will be driven by continued investment in AI and cloud infrastructure, improving operating leverage, and disciplined expense management. That aligns with Dan Ives' sentiment. The Wedbush analyst continues to be bullish on the tech sector, specifically the Magnificent Seven stocks that will lead the AI revolution. Ives and his team believe that the market is not fully appreciating the amount of spending that will be needed over the next three years. Wedbush lists Microsoft, Meta Platforms, NVIDIA, Tesla, and Palantir as its top five tech stocks for the second half of 2025. That bullish outlook comes with a price target of $625, up from $600. However, Wedbush isn’t the most bullish on MSFT stock. That would be Brent Thill from Jefferies Financial Group. The analyst raised his price target for Microsoft to $675 from $600. MSFT stock continues to be in a sustained uptrend. The 20-day simple moving average (SMA), currently around $513.61, is serving as a reliable short-term support level. Price action remains above the 20-day SMA and within the upper range of the Bollinger Bands, signaling strength and proximity to potential overbought conditions. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) shows a slight bullish crossover, with the MACD line (10.45) above the signal line (9.94), suggesting upward momentum could continue. However, there may be limited strength behind the move. One reason is the relative strength indicator (RSI), which, at 64, suggests that MSFT is approaching overbought territory. However, there may still be room for modest upside before a possible pullback or consolidation. Another potential short-term concern is lighter volume after the post-earnings surge. That’s not a bearish signal but could signal that momentum is slowing.

Trump to nominate top economic aide Stephen Miran to Federal Reserve board,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-to-nominate-top-economic-aide-stephen-miran-to-federal-reserve-board-2025-08-07/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Thursday he will nominate a top economic adviser to the Federal Reserve’s board of governors for four months, temporarily filling a vacancy while continuing his search for a longer-term appointment. Trump said he has named Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a seat vacated by governor Adriana Kugler, a Biden appointee who is stepping down Friday. Miran, if approved by the Senate, will serve until January 31, 2026. The appointment is Trump’s first opportunity to exert more control over the Fed, one of the few remaining independent federal agencies. Trump has relentlessly criticized the current chair, Jerome Powell, for keeping short-term interest rates unchanged, calling him “a stubborn MORON” last week on social media. Miran has been a major defender of Trump’s income tax cuts and tariff hikes, arguing that the combination will generate enough economic growth to reduce budget deficits. He also has played down the risk of Trump’s tariffs generating higher inflation, a major source of concern for Powell. The choice of Miran may heighten concerns about political influence over the Fed, which has traditionally been insulated from day-to-day politics. Fed independence is generally seen as key to ensuring that it can take difficult steps to combat inflation, such as raising interest rates, that politicians might be unwilling to take. Federal Reserve governors vote on all the central bank’s interest-rate decisions, as well as its financial regulatory policies. Miran’s nomination, if approved, would add a near-certain vote in support of lower interest rates. Kugler had echoed Powell’s view that the Fed should keep rates unchanged and further evaluate the impact of tariffs on the economy before making any moves. Trump has said he will appoint Fed officials who will cut interest rates, which he says will reduce the borrowing costs of the federal government’s huge $36 trillion debt pile. Trump also wants lower rates to boost moribund home sales, which have been held back partly by higher mortgage costs. Yet the Fed doesn’t directly set longer-term interest rates for things like home and car purchases. At its most recent meeting last week, Fed officials kept their key rate unchanged at 4.3%, where it has stood after three rate cuts late last year. But two Fed governors — Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman — dissented from that decision. Both were appointed by Trump in his first term. Still, even with Miran on the board, 12 Fed officials vote on interest rate policy and many remain concerned that Trump's sweeping tariffs could push inflation higher in the coming months. Miran could be renominated to a longer term on the Fed once his initial appointment is concluded, or replaced by another nominee. Powell’s term as chair ends in May 2026. Yet, Powell could remain on the board of governors until January 2028, even after he steps down as chair. That would deny, or at least delay, an opportunity for Trump to appoint an additional policymaker to the Fed’s board. As a result, one option for Trump is to appoint Powell’s eventual replacement as chair to replace Kugler once the remaining four months of her term are completed. Leading candidates for that position include Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor from 2006 to 2011 and frequent critic of Powell’s chairmanship, and Kevin Hassett, another top Trump economic adviser. Another option for the White House next May would be to select Waller, who is already on the board, to replace Powell, and who has been widely mentioned as a candidate. Marco Casiraghi, senior economist at investment bank Evercore ISI, noted that the choice of Miran could be a positive sign for Waller, because Trump did not take the opportunity to nominate someone likely to become chair once Powell steps down. After the July jobs report was released last Friday, Miran criticized the Fed chair for not cutting benchmark interest rates, saying that Trump had been proven correct on inflation during his first term and would be again. The president has pressured Powell to cut short-term interest rates under the belief that his tariffs will not fuel higher inflationary pressures. “What we’re seeing now in real time is a repetition once again of this pattern where the president will end up having been proven right,” Miran said on MSNBC. “And the Fed will, with a lag and probably quite too late, eventually catch up to the president’s view.” Last year, Miran expressed support for some unconventional economic views in commentaries on the Fed and international economics. Last November, he proposed measures that would reduce the value of the dollar in order to boost exports, reduce imports and cut the U.S. trade deficit, a top priority for Trump. He also suggested tariffs could push U.S. trading partners, such as the European Union and Japan, to accept a cheaper dollar as part of a “Mar-a-Lago Accord,” an echo of the Plaza Accord reached in the 1980s that lowered the dollar's value. As a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, Miran in March 2024 also proposed overhauling the Fed's governance, including by making it easier for a president to fire members of its board of governors. “The Fed’s current governance has facilitated groupthink that has led to significant monetary-policy errors,” Miran wrote in a paper with Dan Katz, now a top official at the Treasury Department. ___","Trump has said he will appoint Fed officials who will cut interest rates, which he says will reduce the borrowing costs of the federal government’s huge $36 trillion debt pile.","Another option for the White House next May would be to select Waller, who is already on the board, to replace Powell, and who has been widely mentioned as a candidate.","“What we’re seeing now in real time is a repetition once again of this pattern where the president will end up having been proven right,” Miran said on MSNBC.","He also suggested tariffs could push U.S. trading partners, such as the European Union and Japan, to accept a cheaper dollar as part of a “Mar-a-Lago Accord,” an echo of the Plaza Accord reached in the 1980s that lowered the dollar's value.",positive,0.7383935451507568
Trump orders federal regulators to probe alleged bank discrimination against conservatives,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-orders-federal-regulators-to-probe-alleged-bank-discrimination-against-conservatives-2025-08-07/,"NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order mandating a probe into whether banks have discriminated against conservatives and certain industries like gun manufacturers and cryptocurrency companies, invoking the vast powers to go after entities that the Republican president alleges have discriminated against him and his allies. The executive order deals with an issue known as “debanking,” which is when banks close accounts of individuals or declines to go into business with certain industries. Trump has accused JPMorgan and Bank of America of debanking him and his companies in the past, something both banks have denied. Trump ordered federal bank regulators to make sure banks do not discriminate against individuals or companies for their political or religious beliefs. He also ordered bank regulators to probe when banks may have allegedly discriminated and refer the cases to the Department of Justice within 120 days. The move could open banks to potential civil or criminal investigations, fines or other punishments. When Trump and his party discuss debanking, they typically refer to banks closing the accounts of a person or company when they no longer want to do business with them. Banks usually say they close accounts or deny loans because the person or business is deemed too risky. The banking industry has long argued that it has a constitutional right to choose whom they go into business with, if it does not violate laws like the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Th act, which was part of several pieces of legislation signed during the Civil Rights Movement, bans banks from discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, sex and other protected statuses. Another type of debanking is when government regulators tell banks to avoid doing business with industries or individuals. Democratic President Barack Obama’s Department of Justice told banks to avoid doing business with “high risk” industries, which included payday lenders and firearms manufacturers. This type of government-directed debanking is also known as reputational risk, where the historic reputation of an industry prompts banks to be more careful about banking and lending. Historic examples include entities who did business in high-risk countries, did business largely in cash or were repeatedly flagged by bank regulators. Under the executive order, bank regulators will need to remove reputational risk from their metrics on how they measure a bank's safety and soundness. Banks, who have benefited from Trumps deregulation agenda and prefer simpler rules and regulations, have tried to strike a cordial tone with the administration, showing themselves as willing brokers who got caught up in a difficult political environment. “It’s in banks’ best interest to take deposits, lend to and support as many customers as possible. Unfortunately, regulatory overreach, supervisory discretion and a maze of obscure rules have stood in the way as the (executive order) makes clear,” the major bank lobby groups said Thursday in a joint statement. Conservatives have argued that reputational risk has become an umbrella term that allows banks to discriminate. The banking industry insists it does not actively debank and does not target specific industries or individuals. The banking industry itself, knowing that reputational risk has become liability, has already been removing any mention of reputational risk from their policies and procedures, particularly since Trump returned to the White House. “Today’s Executive Order helps ensure all consumers and businesses are treated fairly, a goal the nation’s banks share with the Administration,” the banks said. For Trump, the issue of debanking is deeply personal. Trump, in a wide-ranging interview on CNBC, earlier this week alleged that two major banks — JPMorgan and Bank of America — cut him off after he left office in 2021. “They totally discriminate against ... me maybe even more, but they discriminated against many conservatives,” he said to CNBC. Both banks have denied they debanked Trump. “We don’t close accounts for political reasons, and we agree with President Trump that regulatory change is desperately needed,” said a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase in a statement. Former bank regulators have argued that reputational risk, when used along with other metrics, can be a good measure of how well a bank is operating. Banks who end up doing business with companies with a history of violating laws, or violating anti-money laundering rules, can be at risk for failure. Signature Bank failed in 2023 partly because of its exposure to cryptocurrency companies during a major downturn in crypto assets. Credit Suisse in 2009 paid half a billion dollars to regulators for laundering money on behalf of Iran. “Financial risk, and reputational risk, can be intertwined,” said Graham Steele, a former Treasury Department official who also served as a Democratic Congressional staffer on banking issues. The Obama administration's government-directed debanking has been a rallying cry for conservatives. It’s one reason why the cryptocurrency industry backed Trump in 2024. While the Biden administration did not explicitly force banks to debank the crypto industry, Democratic President Joe Biden’s bank regulators did express some public concern about it, a move that was read by banks as a reason to steer away from crypto. That phrasing by the Biden administration was often referred to as “Operation Choke Point 2.0” by Trump and his allies. Republicans have introduced legislation to cut down on alleged acts of debanking as well. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, chair of the Senate Banking Committee, has introduced legislation that would require bank regulators to no longer consider reputational risk as a factor in how they measure a bank’s health and risk profile. “Debanking federally legal businesses and law-abiding citizens is un-American, and President Trump’s Executive Order is a critical step towards protecting Americans’ access to financial services,” Scott said in a statement.","The executive order deals with an issue known as “debanking,” which is when banks close accounts of individuals or declines to go into business with certain industries.","NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order mandating a probe into whether banks have discriminated against conservatives and certain industries like gun manufacturers and cryptocurrency companies, invoking the vast powers to go after entities that the Republican president alleges have discriminated against him and his allies.","Democratic President Barack Obama’s Department of Justice told banks to avoid doing business with “high risk” industries, which included payday lenders and firearms manufacturers.","NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order mandating a probe into whether banks have discriminated against conservatives and certain industries like gun manufacturers and cryptocurrency companies, invoking the vast powers to go after entities that the Republican president alleges have discriminated against him and his allies.",neutral,0.43357715010643005
Trump opens the door for private equity and crypto as 401(k) retirement plan options,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-opens-the-door-for-private-equity-and-crypto-as-401k-retirement-plan-options-2025-08-07/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts could have the option of putting their money in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency investments, according to an executive order signed Thursday by President Donald Trump that could give those financial players long-sought access to a pool of funds worth trillions. There is no immediate change in how people invest part of their work earnings. Federal agencies would need to rewrite rules and regulations to allow the expanded choices, and that would take months or more to complete. But once done, employers could offer a broader array of mutual funds and investments to workers, according to the White House. New plans could invest in alternative assets, particularly private equity, cryptocurrencies and real estate. The Republican president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under 401(k) retirement rules. Americans' retirement plans are governed by a law known as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, better known as ERISA. Employers are required by law to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street. Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold. Trump's move rewards both the $5 trillion private equity industry, which for decades has wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans, and the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump’s 2024 campaign as they aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans. The price of bitcoin was up 2% on Thursday to $116,542 and has nearly doubled since Trump was elected. Under Democratic President Joe Biden, federal regulators were to treat cryptocurrency investments with “extreme care” because of the extreme volatility of crypto. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic. For cryptocurrency companies, which donated millions to Trump’s campaign as well as his inauguration, one goal was to get their industry qualified under ERISA. Coinbase, one of the largest crypto companies in the United States, was also a major donor toward Trump’s military parade in Washington this summer. Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase, where the Biden administration said crypto should be treated as a security. Crypto is particularly popular among young Americans. While volatile, bitcoin has generally moved upward since it was created by an anonymous programmer nearly 20 years ago. “It was inevitable that bitcoin would make its way into American 401(k)'s,” said Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan Bitcoin. “As fiduciaries realize bitcoin’s risk-adjusted upside over the long term, we’ll see growing allocations, especially from younger, tech-savvy workers who want hard money, not melting ice cubes.” Private equity firms rely heavily on high-net-worth individuals and state and private pension plans, which have extremely long investment timelines. But having access to Americans' retirement assets would open up a deep pool of cash. Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has told investors going back to at least 2017 that it was a “dream” of his and the industry to be able to draw upon these retirement assets. Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat, have agreed that private equity investments, which can be riskier, more expensive and less liquid than traditional stock and bond market mutual funds, should not be included in 401(k) plans. The average historic annual return on private equity assets going back to 1990 is roughly 13%, net of fees, according to Cambridge Associates. The S&P 500 index has had an approximate annual return, including dividends, of roughly 10.6% in the same period of time. However, private equity assets tend to be locked up for years, because the companies underlying the assets have to be sold on the private market, making them highly illiquid compared to stocks, which can be sold in a day. “We look forward to working with the Trump Administration on a thoughtful framework that expands access to alternatives for retirement savers, offering Americans more diversification and investment options with appropriate investor guardrails,” said Bryan Corbett, the president and CEO of the Managed Funds Association, which is the trade group for the private equity industry. Even after the regulations are written, it will take time for major retirement plan companies, such as Fidelity, Vanguard, T.

Constellation Energy’s Earnings Beat Signals a New Era,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/constellation-energys-earnings-beat-signals-a-new-era/,"Constellation Energy NASDAQ: CEG delivered a solid second-quarter earnings report on Aug. 7, beating analyst estimates and reinforcing its crucial role in the digital economy. This strong performance is the latest chapter in a compelling story that has sent its stock soaring over 87% in the past year. The company's strategy is clear and potent: leverage its vast, carbon-free nuclear fleet to satisfy the immense energy appetite of the artificial intelligence (AI) and data center industries. While Constellation’s forward outlook has rarely been brighter, the stock's remarkable rally has pushed its valuation to new heights, leading investors to ask a critical question: Is the immense potential of AI already built into Constellation Energy’s share price? The AI revolution runs on electricity, and it requires massive amounts of reliable, 24/7 baseline power. As technology companies also face mounting pressure to meet sustainability goals, the demand for clean, firm energy has skyrocketed. This market dynamic has created a perfect storm for Constellation, whose nuclear fleet, the largest in the U.S., is uniquely positioned to deliver this exact product. Recent achievements provide compelling evidence of this strategy in action: While Constellation's growth prospects are exciting, its investment profile is anchored by powerful financial and policy guardrails that mitigate risk. The most significant of these is the federal nuclear Production Tax Credit (PTC). Solidified with strong bipartisan support, the PTC program provides a government-backed revenue floor for the company's nuclear fleet through 2032. This policy offers exceptional earnings stability and insulates the company’s foundational business from the volatility of commodity markets, giving investors a rare degree of confidence and visibility. This policy backstop is paired with strong financial discipline. Constellation maintains an investment-grade balance sheet with a healthy debt-to-equity ratio (D/E) of 0.79. Furthermore, management is actively signaling its confidence in future cash flows through shareholder-friendly actions. In the second quarter, the company initiated a $400 million accelerated share repurchase program and has publicly committed to a 10% dividend increase for 2025. This combination of a federal safety net and prudent capital management creates a reinforced foundation that supports the company’s ambitious growth strategy. After its meteoric rise, Constellation no longer carries the valuation of a typical utility sector company. Trading at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of approximately 35x, the stock commands a significant premium over its sector peers. This high valuation is the central debate for investors today. The argument for the premium is that Constellation has transcended its traditional utility classification. The market is increasingly viewing it as a critical AI infrastructure provider, an indispensable part of the digital supply chain. Much like a data center REIT that owns the physical buildings or a semiconductor firm that makes the chips, Constellation provides the essential resource that powers the entire ecosystem. From this perspective, its valuation is being benchmarked against high-growth technology enablers, not slow-and-steady power companies. This view is gaining traction on Wall Street. While the average analyst price target of $309.29 has been eclipsed by the stock’s rapid appreciation, high-end targets now reach $390. This indicates that some analysts believe the re-rating is justified and that there is still significant upside as the company continues to execute on its AI-driven strategy. Constellation Energy has masterfully positioned itself at the intersection of the clean energy transition and the AI revolution. Its second-quarter results are powerful evidence that the company’s strategy is working. The company has a clear growth runway, powered by durable demand from the world’s largest technology firms and fortified by supportive government policy. The primary challenge for investors now is the stock's valuation, which has already baked in a tremendous amount of future success. Therefore, the focus shifts to continued, flawless execution. The upcoming closing of the Calpine acquisition and the announcement of new data center contracts will be critical milestones for validating and ultimately growing into the premium valuation the market has awarded Constellation Energy.

EPA cancels $7 billion Biden-era grant program to boost solar energy,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/epa-cancels-7-billion-biden-era-grant-program-to-boost-solar-energy-2025-08-07/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday terminated a $7 billion grant program intended to help pay for residential solar projects for more than 900,000 lower-income U.S. households, in the latest Trump administration move hindering the nation’s shift to cleaner energy. The funding, part of the Biden-era's Solar for All program, was awarded to 60 recipients including states, tribes and regions for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens. Solar, a renewable energy, is widely regarded as a way to introduce cleaner power onto the electrical grid and lower energy bills for American consumers. Under Republican President Donald Trump, officials have pursued dozens of deregulatory measures related to federal rules intended to protect clean air and water. Last week, the EPA proposed rescinding the agency’s “endangerment finding” which serves as the scientific and legal basis for regulating planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. The administration has taken steps to bolster fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas as it pursues American ""energy dominance in the global market. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement on social media that authority for the solar program was eliminated under the tax-and-spending law signed by Trump last month. It eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, that set aside $20 billion for community development projects to boost renewable energy and an additional $7 billion for the solar program. “The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,″ Zeldin said. “Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!” Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, who introduced the Solar for All program to cut electric bills for working families, said Zeldin’s action was illegal. “Solar for All means lower utility bills, many thousands of good-paying jobs and real action to address the existential threat of climate change,″ Sanders said in a statement. ”At a time when working families are getting crushed by skyrocketing energy costs and the planet is literally burning, sabotaging this program isn’t just wrong — it’s absolutely insane. We will fight back to preserve this enormously important program.” Only $53 million of the $7 billion awarded has been spent, according to a tally by the research firm Atlas Public Policy. Several grant recipients this week said their programs were in planning phases. Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the EPA has no legal authority to terminate grants already appropriated by Congress. “These grants are delivering billions of dollars of investment to red and blue states alike,″ she said. Bosh said solar was one of the cheapest energy sources at a time of growing demand for electricity. “This administration is continuing to dig itself into a hole,” she said. The EPA has argued that the tax and policy law allows the agency to rescind the money it has already obligated. The recipients of that money disagree, saying the bulk of the money had already been disbursed and is not affected by the law. Southern Environmental Law Center litigation director Kym Meyer said if the administration wants to move forward with canceling Solar for All funds, “we will see them in court.” Grant recipients have already challenged the administration’s actions, and a judge ruled in April the EPA cannot freeze the contracts. Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment Committee, called Zeldin’s elimination of the solar program a betrayal “that will further hike electricity costs and make our power grid less reliable.” “Trump is — yet again — putting his fossil fuel megadonors first,” he added. ___ St. John reported from Detroit. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

France’s top court strikes down pesticide clause in farming law,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/frances-top-court-strikes-down-pesticide-clause-in-farming-law-2025-08-07/,"PARIS (AP) — France’s highest court on Thursday blocked a key part of a contentious farming law that would have brought back a banned pesticide. The court said that the measure failed to protect the environment and future generations. The rest of the law — known as the “Duplomb law,” after the senator who proposed it — was allowed to stand. The bill, passed in early July, aimed to loosen rules for farmers and fast-track projects like water storage. It was backed by the government and major farming unions, but met fierce opposition from scientists, health experts and green groups. At the heart of the outrage was acetamiprid, a pesticide banned in France since 2018 for its role in harming bees and other pollinators. Farmers, especially sugar beet growers, had pushed for its return. But the court ruled that the proposal wasn't strict enough, and ignored France’s constitutional commitment to environmental protection. The backlash was swift and widespread. A student-led petition against the law drew more than 2 million signatures — one of the biggest in French history. Opponents said that the bill was rushed through parliament with barely any debate, and warned that it put public health and biodiversity at risk. The ruling is a blow to President Emmanuel Macron’s government, which had defended the bill until the end. Critics called the decision a win for democracy and the planet. Some lawmakers have already vowed to push for a full repeal in the coming months.

What US consumers can expect from new tariffs on imported goods,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/what-us-consumers-can-expect-from-new-tariffs-on-imported-goods-2025-08-07/,"American businesses and consumers soon will have a better idea of how President Donald Trump's foreign trade agenda might affect them now that the United States has imposed higher tariffs on products from dozens of countries. It’s been nearly 100 years since the nation had an overall import tax rate as high as the one set Thursday. But the individual impact on business costs and consumer prices could vary as much as the tariffs applied to goods of nearly 70 U.S. trading partners, from complicated economies like the European Union to the small African nation of Lesotho. Exports from a majority of them are getting taxed at 15%. For a handful of countries in Asia, the rate is 19%. Products from the rest are subject to taxes of 20% to 50%. Meanwhile, a 55% tariff on Chinese-made goods is scheduled to take effect next week if a U.S.-China trade deal is not agreed on before then. Businesses in the U.S. and abroad have been dealing in various ways since February with Trump's fluctuating tariffs on specific products and countries. Many automakers appeared to have absorbed the costs for now. But recent government data indicated that retail prices for groceries, furniture and appliances started creeping up in June. Because tariffs are a tax on imports, economists have expected U.S. consumers to foot at least part of the bill eventually. The country-specific round enforced Thursday, together with the president's earlier tariffs on specific sectors such as automobiles and steel, will increase prices 1.8% in the short term, the Budget Lab at Yale estimated. That’s the equivalent of a $2,400 loss of income per U.S. household, according to the non-partisan policy research center The projections were based on an analysis of duties implemented this year through Wednesday, as well as a doubling of the levy on items made in India that Trump said would be implemented near the end of August. ""Retailers have been able to hold the line on pricing so far, but the new increased tariffs will significantly raise costs for U.S. retailers, manufacturers and consumers,” Jon Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation trade group, said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press. Here’s what to know about the tariffs and where U.S. consumers are most likely to notice effects: Trump unveiled sweeping import taxes on goods coming into the U.S. from 66 countries, the European Union, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands in April. He said the “reciprocal” tariffs were meant to boost domestic manufacturing and restore fairness to global trade. The president paused the country-specific tariffs a week later but applied a 10% tax to most imports. In early July, he began notifying countries that their exports would be subject to higher tariffs on Aug. 1 unless they reached trade deals. A week ago, he pushed the start date to Thursday. In the meantime, Trump announced a 35% tariff on imports from Canada, but delayed action on Mexico while negotiations continued. However, a free trade agreement reached with Mexico and Canada during Trump's first term shields most of those countries' products from punishing duties. The president also ordered a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil. This week, he signed an executive order to take India's tariff rate from 25% to 50% for its purchases of Russian oil. The timing gives India and Russia a chance to negotiate with the Trump administration. Other duties not specific to countries remain in place, such as a 50% tariff on imported aluminum and steel announced in June. Trump also threatened 100% tariffs on computer chips that aren’t made in the U.S. The administration has said tariffs are still coming on imported pharmaceutical drugs. The U.S. Commerce Department reported on July 31 that prices rose 2.6% in June, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Earlier in July, the government reported that its primary inflation measure, the Consumer Price Index, also ticked higher in June as the cost of furniture, toys and other frequently imported items increased. Shoppers should be prepared to pay more for clothes and shoes because the combined tariffs “disproportionately affect clothing and textiles,” according to the Budget Lab at Yale. It estimates that shoe prices will go up 39% temporarily and stay 19% above where they are now. For apparel, the Budget Lab put the comparable figures at 37% and 18%. Overall, Americans face an average tax of 18.6% for imported products, the highest rate since 1933, the research center said. The tariffs will almost certainly result in higher food prices, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. The U.S. simply doesn't make enough of some products, like bananas or coffee, to satisfy demand. Fish, beer and liquor are also likely to get more expensive, the foundation said. The U.S. Wine Trade Alliance and other alcohol industry trade groups sent a letter to Trump that warned a 15% tariff on European wines and spirits could result in more than 25,000 American job losses and cost the industry nearly $2 billion in lost sales. “Mr. President, we need toasts, not tariffs, as we head into the most important season for our industry,” read the letter dated Wednesday. Wine distributors and retailers avoided price increases before now by accelerating shipments from France and other EU countries earlier in the year. But with the EU's tariff rate raised to 15% on Thursday, customers may see European wines costing 30% more in September, U.S. Wine Trade Alliance President Ben Aneff said. Some automakers already raised prices to counteract tariffs. Luxury sports car maker Ferrari said last week it was waiting for more details of Trump's trade deal with the EU before scaling back a 10% surcharge it put on most vehicles in the U.S. For the most part, automakers waited for details instead of passing on tariff costs to consumers. But that could change. General Motors said on July 22 that the impact of the tariffs could get more pronounced in the third quarter of the year. GM has estimated the tariffs will cost it $4 billion to $5 billion this year. Toyota reported Thursday a 37% drop in profits in the April-June quarter, cutting its full-year earnings forecasts largely because of Trump’s tariffs. Even with so many new tariffs kicking in, the tariff situation remains fluid. Trump’s use of an emergency powers law to implement tariffs is being challenged in the courts. The case is expected to wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court. Moreover, the tariffs on goods from China haven't been finalized. Consumers may start seeing more effects when the administration ends a tax exemption for small parcels sent from other countries. Trump last week signed an order to suspend the “de minimis"" exemption that has allowed shipments valued at $800 or less to enter the U.S. duty-free. International e-commerce companies have widely used the rule to avoid paying customs charges. Trump withdrew the exemption in early April for goods shipped from China and Hong Kong tariff-free. It is now set to be eliminated for low-value packages from every country on Aug. 29. ___ AP reporter Colleen Barry in Milan contributed to this report.","The U.S. Wine Trade Alliance and other alcohol industry trade groups sent a letter to Trump that warned a 15% tariff on European wines and spirits could result in more than 25,000 American job losses and cost the industry nearly $2 billion in lost sales.","That’s the equivalent of a $2,400 loss of income per U.S. household, according to the non-partisan policy research center The projections were based on an analysis of duties implemented this year through Wednesday, as well as a doubling of the levy on items made in India that Trump said would be implemented near the end of August.","But with the EU's tariff rate raised to 15% on Thursday, customers may see European wines costing 30% more in September, U.S. Wine Trade Alliance President Ben Aneff said.","That’s the equivalent of a $2,400 loss of income per U.S. household, according to the non-partisan policy research center The projections were based on an analysis of duties implemented this year through Wednesday, as well as a doubling of the levy on items made in India that Trump said would be implemented near the end of August.",negative,0.5531033277511597
"Paramount and Skydance close their $8 billion merger, kicking off reign of new entertainment giant",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/paramount-and-skydance-close-their-8-billion-merger-kicking-off-reign-of-new-entertainment-giant-2025-08-07/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Skydance and Paramount officially closed their $8 billion merger on Thursday — kicking off the reign of a new entertainment giant after a contentious, over year-long endeavor to get the transaction over the finish line. The new company — which will trade under the “PSKY” ticker on Wall Street — brings Paramount's legacy Hollywood footprint, major TV networks like CBS and MTV, streaming services and more under the roof of a new power player: billionaire Skydance founder David Ellison. “Today marks an exciting and pivotal moment as we prepare to bring Paramount’s legacy as a Hollywood institution into the future of entertainment,"" Ellison, who is now Chairman and CEO of Paramount, a Skydance Corporation, said in a statement. He added that he aims to “honor exceptional storytelling while modernizing how we make and deliver content."" The merger's close came just two weeks after it received regulatory approval from the Trump administration. While now a done deal, the path towards that approval was far from smooth sailing. Months of scrutiny and turmoil surrounded the transaction — particularly amid President Donald Trump’s legal battle with “60 Minutes,” the crown jewel of Paramount-owned broadcast network CBS. With the specter of the Trump administration potentially blocking the hard-fought deal with Skydance, Paramount agreed to pay a $16 million settlement to the president in early July. Critics of the settlement lambasted it as a veiled bribe to appease Trump, amid rising alarm over editorial independence overall. Further outrage also emerged after CBS said it was canceling Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show” just days after the comedian sharply criticized the parent company’s settlement on air. Paramount cited financial reasons, but big names both within and outside the company have questioned those motives. When still seeking approval to buy Paramount from the Federal Communication Commission, Skydance management assured regulators that it would carefully watch for any perceived bias at CBS News and hire an ombudsman to review any complaints about fairness. In filings just last month, the company’s general counsel maintained that New Paramount will embody “a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum” — and also noted that it plans to take a “comprehensive review” of CBS to make “any necessary changes.” By the time the deal was approved, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr hailed the merger as an opportunity to bring more balance to “once-storied” CBS. “Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly. It is time for a change,"" Carr said. Carr also pointed to other commitments from Skydance — including company assurances about ending diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at Paramount. In a letter addressed to Carr days before the FCC's greenlight, Skydance wrote to “confirm the elimination” of DEI initiatives previously in place at Paramount — and maintained that Skydance “does not have DEI programs in place today and will not establish such initiatives.” Skydance pointed to the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision on affirmative action in college admissions, but such moves also arrive amid the Trump administration’s wider crackdown on DEI in the workplace — and the company cited recent federal mandates impacting employers, too, noting that Paramount announced “significant changes” to its recruiting and hiring practices in February 2025. The FCC approved the merger by a 2-1 vote on July 24. The regulator who opposed it, FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, expressed disdain for how it all came together — pointing to “months of cowardly capitulation to this administration.” “In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom,” Gomez, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, said in a statement. She also said the agency overstepped its authority by “undermining legitimate efforts to combat discrimination and expand opportunity.” Paramount's new leaders will be watched particularly closely for how they deal with CBS News, given the $16 million settlement with Trump following his complaint about last fall's “60 Minutes” interview with his Democratic opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris. And the merger could also have ripple effects across other Paramount properties, including its late night and comedy programming. When first announcing the deal in July 2024, Ellison also stressed the need to transition into a “tech hybrid” to stay competitive in today’s entertainment landscape. That included plans to “rebuild” the Paramount+ streaming service, among wider efforts to expand direct-to-consumer offerings in a world with more entertainment options and shorter attention spans. Before you consider Harris, you'll want to hear this.","In filings just last month, the company’s general counsel maintained that New Paramount will embody “a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum” — and also noted that it plans to take a “comprehensive review” of CBS to make “any necessary changes.” By the time the deal was approved, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr hailed the merger as an opportunity to bring more balance to “once-storied” CBS.","In a letter addressed to Carr days before the FCC's greenlight, Skydance wrote to “confirm the elimination” of DEI initiatives previously in place at Paramount — and maintained that Skydance “does not have DEI programs in place today and will not establish such initiatives.” Skydance pointed to the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision on affirmative action in college admissions, but such moves also arrive amid the Trump administration’s wider crackdown on DEI in the workplace — and the company cited recent federal mandates impacting employers, too, noting that Paramount announced “significant changes” to its recruiting and hiring practices in February 2025.","Critics of the settlement lambasted it as a veiled bribe to appease Trump, amid rising alarm over editorial independence overall.","In a letter addressed to Carr days before the FCC's greenlight, Skydance wrote to “confirm the elimination” of DEI initiatives previously in place at Paramount — and maintained that Skydance “does not have DEI programs in place today and will not establish such initiatives.” Skydance pointed to the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision on affirmative action in college admissions, but such moves also arrive amid the Trump administration’s wider crackdown on DEI in the workplace — and the company cited recent federal mandates impacting employers, too, noting that Paramount announced “significant changes” to its recruiting and hiring practices in February 2025.",negative,0.7381118535995483
"OpenAI launches GPT-5, a potential barometer for whether AI hype is justified",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/openai-releases-gpt-5-a-potential-barometer-for-whether-artificial-intelligence-hype-is-justified-2025-08-07/,"OpenAI on Thursday released the fifth generation of the artificial intelligence technology that powers ChatGPT, a product update that's being closely watched as a measure of whether generative AI is advancing rapidly or hitting a plateau. GPT-5 arrives more than two years after the March 2023 release of GPT-4, bookending a period of intense commercial investment, hype and worry over AI's capabilities. In anticipation, rival Anthropic released the latest version of its own chatbot, Claude, earlier in the week, part of a race with Google and other competitors in the U.S. and China to leapfrog each other on AI benchmarks. Meanwhile, longtime OpenAI partner Microsoft said it will incorporate GPT-5 into its own AI assistant, Copilot. Expectations are high for the newest version of OpenAI's flagship model because the San Francisco company has long positioned its technical advancements as a path toward artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a technology that is supposed to surpass humans at economically valuable work. It is also trying to raise huge amounts of money to get there, in part to pay for the costly computer chips and data centers needed to build and run the technology. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described the new model as a “significant step along our path to AGI” but mostly focused on its usability to the 700 million people he says use ChatGPT each week. “It’s like talking to an expert — a legitimate PhD-level expert in anything, any area you need, on demand,” Altman said at a launch event livestreamed Thursday. It may take some time to see how people use the new model — now available, with usage limits, to anyone with a free ChatGPT account. The Thursday event focused heavily on ChatGPT's use in coding, an area where Anthropic is seen as a leader, and featured a guest appearance by the CEO of coding software maker Cursor, an important Anthropic customer. OpenAI's presenters also spent time talking about safety improvements to make the chatbot “less deceptive” and stop it from producing harmful responses to “cleverly worded” prompts that could bypass its guardrails. The Associated Press reported Wednesday on a study that showed ChatGPT was providing dangerous information about drugs and self-harm to researchers posing as teenagers. At a technical level, GPT-5 shows “modest but significant improvements” on the latest benchmarks, but when compared to GPT-4, it also looks very different and resets OpenAI's flagship technology in a way that could set the stage for future innovations, said John Thickstun, an assistant professor of computer science at Cornell University. “I’m not a believer that it's the end of work and that AI is just going to solve all humanity’s problems for it, but I do think there’s still a lot of headroom for them, and other people in this space, to continue to improve the technology,” he said. “Not just capitalizing on the gains that have already been made.” OpenAI started in 2015 as a nonprofit research laboratory to safely build AGI and has since incorporated a for-profit company with a valuation that has grown to $300 billion. The company has tried to change its structure since the nonprofit board ousted Altman in November 2023. He was reinstated days later. It has not yet reported making a profit but has run into hurdles escaping its nonprofit roots, including scrutiny from the attorneys general in California and Delaware, who have oversight of nonprofits, and a lawsuit by Elon Musk, an early donor to and founder of OpenAI who now runs his own AI company. Most recently, OpenAI has said it will turn its for-profit company into a public benefit corporation, which must balance the interests of shareholders and its mission. OpenAI is the world's third most valuable private company and a bellwether for the AI industry, with an “increasingly fragile moat” at the frontier of AI, according to banking giant JPMorgan Chase, which recently made a rare decision to cover the company despite it not being publicly traded. The inability of a single AI developer to have a “sustained competitive edge” could increasingly force companies to compete on lowering the prices of their AI products, the bank said in a report last month. —— The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives.","Expectations are high for the newest version of OpenAI's flagship model because the San Francisco company has long positioned its technical advancements as a path toward artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a technology that is supposed to surpass humans at economically valuable work.","“I’m not a believer that it's the end of work and that AI is just going to solve all humanity’s problems for it, but I do think there’s still a lot of headroom for them, and other people in this space, to continue to improve the technology,” he said.",The Associated Press reported Wednesday on a study that showed ChatGPT was providing dangerous information about drugs and self-harm to researchers posing as teenagers.,"“I’m not a believer that it's the end of work and that AI is just going to solve all humanity’s problems for it, but I do think there’s still a lot of headroom for them, and other people in this space, to continue to improve the technology,” he said.",positive,0.7481862306594849
4 Semiconductor Stocks Earning Fresh Wall Street Upgrades,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/4-semiconductor-stocks-earning-fresh-wall-street-upgrades/,"Over the past weeks, important players in the semiconductor industry have reported earnings, with several names putting Wall Street estimates to shame. This caused analysts to lift their price targets significantly. These updates hint that the semiconductor rally may still have legs, especially as end-market demand improves and long-term themes like AI and automation remain intact. Below, we highlight four companies whose recent earnings and revised analyst outlooks stand out. First up is semiconductor manufacturing equipment giant Lam Research NASDAQ: LRCX, which released earnings on July 30. The company posted big beats on both sales and adjusted earnings per share (EPS). However, shares still fell more than 4% afterward as worries remain around the company’s business in China. This didn’t deter Wall Street from issuing significant upgrades. MarketBeat tracked nearly ten analysts who lifted their targets on July 31 and Aug. 1. On average, these analysts increased their price targets by more than $10. Overall, the MarketBeat consensus price target on Lam is around $107, implying around 9% upside. However, the average target among those analysts who updated their forecasts is nearly $113. This figure indicates substantially more upside, suggesting shares could rise nearly 15%. TD Cowen is notably one of the stock’s biggest bulls. Their $125 target implies 27% upside potential in this chip equipment stalwart. Next is Impinj NASDAQ: PI. This company makes small chips and related devices that help track the movement of goods. This helps customers with things like inventory management and theft prevention. Impinj blew past expectations in Q2, causing shares to gain by a whopping 26% on July 31. MarketBeat also tracked several analysts who lifted their targets on the stock on July 31, doing so by an average of 30%. However, analysts seem to believe that the market has now priced in the stock’s gain. The MarketBeat consensus price target in Impinj is around $163, indicating shares are fairly valued. Still, Impinj has a key tailwind that could allow it to deliver significant upside longer-term: the European Union’s Digital Product Passport (DPP) law. The DPP legislation requires that every product sold or made in the region is trackable throughout its lifecycle. Impinj’s technology could help companies comply, especially in its number one market: textiles. The law starts applying to textiles in 2027, which could drive big-time sales for Impinj. Monolithic Power Systems NASDAQ: MPWR shined in Q2. The company delivered better-than-expected results on the top line, bottom line, and guidance. This led shares to surge more than 10% on Aug. 1. All but one analyst tracked by MarketBeat boosted their price target on the stock in August. Overall, these analysts increased their price targets by an average of $42. The average price target among those who issued updates comes in at $850, moderately higher than the stock’s $838 consensus target. The updated $850 target implies around 2.3% upside. However, opinions range widely. Wells Fargo’s $750 target suggests around 10% downside, while KeyCorp’s $950 target implies over 14% upside potential. Still, Monolithic has delivered far above the upside that Wall Street previously forecasted. On May 7, Wall Street only saw 14% upside in shares. However, since that point, the stock has provided a total return of nearly 31%. Additionally, MPWR has seen its shares rise after nine out of its last 12 earnings releases. It’s not crazy to think the company could continue to outperform Wall Street expectations. Electronic automation design software company Cadence Design Systems NASDAQ: CDNS has also seen a notable boost in sentiment. In Q2, the company beat expectations on sales, adjusted EPS, and raised its full-year guidance. This helped shares post a nearly 10% gain on July 29, and MarketBeat tracked several analysts who raised their price targets. The MarketBeat consensus target on Cadence is just $364, almost exactly equal to the stock’s closing price on Aug. 4. However, focusing on price targets updated after earnings changes the picture. The average target among those analysts is $389, implying nearly 7% upside. Although not groundbreaking, it is certainly a big improvement over the consensus forecast. Overall, these four names are clearly moving in the right direction. Their latest results showed that Wall Street underestimated them, and analysts are now scrambling to raise their price targets. While Monolithic’s track record of topping expectations stands out, the rest of the group is also showing signs of strength. Impinj has a long-term tailwind that could prove its recent rally is just the beginning. Lam’s weakness on earnings day may have been overdone. And Cadence is back on the radar after another solid beat. If these trends continue, analysts may still be playing catch-up. Before you consider Lam Research, you'll want to hear this.","In Q2, the company beat expectations on sales, adjusted EPS, and raised its full-year guidance.","MarketBeat also tracked several analysts who lifted their targets on the stock on July 31, doing so by an average of 30%.","Still, Impinj has a key tailwind that could allow it to deliver significant upside longer-term: the European Union’s Digital Product Passport (DPP) law.","The MarketBeat consensus target on Cadence is just $364, almost exactly equal to the stock’s closing price on Aug. 4.",neutral,0.9055880308151245
Trump's planned 100% computer chip tariff sparks confusion among businesses and trading partners,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trumps-planned-100-computer-chip-tariff-sparks-confusion-among-businesses-and-trading-partners-2025-08-07/,"President Donald Trump's ambiguous plans for 100% tariffs on computer chips that aren't made in the U.S. are stoking confusion among businesses and trading partners — boosting stocks for leading semiconductor companies while leaving smaller producers scrambling to understand the implications. “We are still waiting for official guidance,"" said Limor Fried, founder and engineer at Adafruit Industries, a small electronics maker in New York. The chips that go into Adafruit's products come through U.S. sales and distribution companies as well as direct from companies in the Philippines and Taiwan. If those chips aren't exempt from tariffs, “it would increase the costs that go into our designs as the semiconductors are the most expensive component in our assemblies,” Fried said. ""For many of these tariffs, we often have to wait until we get a bill to know our exposure, and then we adjust our pricing to account for the increases.” The U.S. imports a relatively small number of chips because most of the foreign-made chips in a device — from an iPhone to a car — were already assembled into a product, or part of a product, before it landed in the country. ""The real question everybody in the industry is asking is whether there will be a component tariff, where the chips in a device would require some sort of separate tariff calculation,” said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Trump said Wednesday that companies that ""made a commitment to build"" in the U.S. would be spared the import tax, even if they are not yet producing those chips in American factories. “We’ll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors,” Trump said in the Oval Office while meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook. “But if you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no charge.” Wall Street investors interpreted that as good news not just for U.S. companies like Intel and Nvidia, but also for the biggest Asian chipmakers like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company that have been working to build U.S. factories. But it left greater uncertainty for smaller chipmakers in Europe and Asia that have little exposure to the artificial intelligence boom but still make semiconductors inserted into essential products like cars or washing machines. German chipmaker Infineon Technologies, which supplies chips to the auto industry, said in an emailed statement Thursday that it “can’t speculate about potential semiconductor tariffs” and Trump's announcement, “as no official documents have been published at this point.” These producers ""probably aren’t large enough to get on the map for an exemption and quite probably wouldn’t have the kind of excess capital and margins to be able to add investment at a large scale into the United States,” Chorzempa said. It's also not clear how the chip-specific tariffs would apply to trading partners that already made broader deals with Trump — such as agreements with the European Union, Japan and South Korea that tax most goods at 15%. A trade group, the Semiconductor Industry Association, said Thursday it was “eager to learn more” about the planned chip tariffs, “including the scope and structure of exemptions.” The announcement came more than three months after Trump temporarily exempted most electronics from his administration’s most onerous tariffs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage of computer chips increased the price of autos and contributed to higher inflation. Chorzempa said chip tariffs could again raise prices by hundreds of dollars per vehicle if the semiconductors inside a car are not exempt. “There’s a chip that allows you to open and close the window,"" Chorzempa said. ""There’s a chip that is running the entertainment system. There is a chip that’s kind of running all the electronics. There are chips, especially in EVs, that are doing power management, all that kind of stuff.” Much of the investment into building U.S. chip factories began with the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act that President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022, providing more than $50 billion to support new computer chip plants, fund research and train workers for the industry. Trump has vocally opposed those financial incentives and taken a different approach, betting that the threat of dramatically higher chip costs would force most companies to open factories domestically, despite the risk that tariffs could squeeze corporate profits and push up prices for electronics. Trump’s announcement could be a signal for other chipmakers to imitate the investments that companies like South Korea's Samsung are making, said Long Le, a business professor at Santa Clara University. But with China’s SMIC and Huawei unlikely to be exempted, it could also give the Trump administration ""more leverage at the trading table"" ahead of an upcoming deal with China, he said.","If those chips aren't exempt from tariffs, “it would increase the costs that go into our designs as the semiconductors are the most expensive component in our assemblies,” Fried said.","German chipmaker Infineon Technologies, which supplies chips to the auto industry, said in an emailed statement Thursday that it “can’t speculate about potential semiconductor tariffs” and Trump's announcement, “as no official documents have been published at this point.” These producers ""probably aren’t large enough to get on the map for an exemption and quite probably wouldn’t have the kind of excess capital and margins to be able to add investment at a large scale into the United States,” Chorzempa said.","“We’ll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors,” Trump said in the Oval Office while meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook.","""For many of these tariffs, we often have to wait until we get a bill to know our exposure, and then we adjust our pricing to account for the increases.” The U.S. imports a relatively small number of chips because most of the foreign-made chips in a device — from an iPhone to a car — were already assembled into a product, or part of a product, before it landed in the country.",neutral,0.8992317914962769
Average rate on a 30-year mortgage drops to lowest level since April,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/average-rate-on-a-30-year-mortgage-drops-to-lowest-level-since-april-2025-08-07/,"The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage has fallen to its lowest level in four months, welcome news for prospective homebuyers who have been held back by stubbornly high home financing costs. The long-term rate fell to 6.63% from 6.72% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.47%. Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also fell. The average rate dropped to 5.75% from 5.85% last week. A year ago, it was 5.63%, Freddie Mac said. Elevated mortgage rates have helped keep the U.S. housing market in a sales slump since early 2022, when rates started to climb from the rock-bottom lows they reached during the pandemic. Home sales sank last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. This is the third week in a row that rates have come down. The latest average rate on a 30-year mortgage is now just above 6.62%, the low point for this year set April 10. Even so, mortgage rates are not far from their high this year of 7.04%, which was set in mid-January. That's helped keep home sales sluggish so far this year. Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors’ expectations for the economy and inflation. The main barometer is the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans. The yield was at 4.23% at midday Thursday, up slightly from 4.22% late Wednesday. The yield is well below where it was last week, before Friday’s weaker-than-expected report on the U.S. job market ignited worries that the Trump administration’s tariffs are stalling hiring plans by employers. Last Wednesday, the central bank’s policymaking committee voted to hold its main interest rate steady. And Fed Chair Jerome Powell pushed back on expectations that the Fed could cut rates at its next meeting in September, noting that inflation remained above the Fed’s 2% target and the job market was “in balance.” But the latest jobs report may shift that stance. Traders on Wall Street are now betting heavily that the Fed will need to cut interest rates next month, something President Donald Trump has been demanding the Fed, and Powell specifically, to do. A cut in rates could give the job market and overall economy a boost, but it could also fuel inflation just as Trump’s tariff policies risk raising prices for U.S. consumers. “While both buyers and sellers welcome lower mortgage rates, it’s not clear whether rates will continue to fall,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. “A weaker economy could lead to lower mortgage rates, but the risks of higher inflation could keep rates elevated.” Home shoppers who can afford to buy at current mortgage rates are benefiting from more homes on the market. That's led to sellers lowering asking prices compared to a year ago in many metropolitan areas, including Miami, Chicago and Los Angeles, according to Realtor.com. Lower mortgage rates tend to spur more would-be homebuyers to jump into the market, potentially driving home prices higher. Economists generally expect the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain above 6% this year. Recent forecasts by Realtor.com and Fannie Mae project the average rate will ease to around 6.4% by the end of this year.",The average rate dropped to 5.75% from 5.85% last week.,"And Fed Chair Jerome Powell pushed back on expectations that the Fed could cut rates at its next meeting in September, noting that inflation remained above the Fed’s 2% target and the job market was “in balance.” But the latest jobs report may shift that stance.","The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage has fallen to its lowest level in four months, welcome news for prospective homebuyers who have been held back by stubbornly high home financing costs.","And Fed Chair Jerome Powell pushed back on expectations that the Fed could cut rates at its next meeting in September, noting that inflation remained above the Fed’s 2% target and the job market was “in balance.” But the latest jobs report may shift that stance.",negative,0.9415520429611206

Uber Technologies Is Driving Cash Flow: Ride It Higher for Life,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/uber-technologies-is-driving-cash-flow-ride-it-higher-for-life/,"Uber Technologies NYSE: UBER started as a risky new technology and has developed into a blue-chip quality stock whose business is entrenched in society. The single factor that most summarizes that quality is its capital return, which has been robust and is getting richer by the year. The company’s business, operational quality, and growth trajectory led the board to authorize another, larger-than-before share repurchase authorization worth $20 billion or roughly 10% of the early August market cap. The takeaway is that Uber Technologies is no longer a risky tech start-up but now a buy-and-hold quality tech stock whose stock price has significant room to run. Uber’s share buybacks are not trivial. While not aggressively reducing the count, the Q2 activity resulted in a 1.1% reduction compared to the prior year and is expected to continue offsetting share-based compensation moving forward. The question is whether the company will accelerate its buying or maintain a steady pace, and when a dividend payment may be forthcoming. Comparable stocks that turn cash flow into buybacks and dividends tend to see their share prices trend higher over time. The valuation metrics suggest this stock could rise by 400% to 600% over the next 10 years. The stock trades at 32x its current year's earnings outlook, aligning with blue-chip peers, but its growth forecasts are much more robust. The forecast is for a sustained high-20% to high-30% earnings CAGR for at least the next decade, which puts the business near 5x earnings by 2035. Assuming that Uber continues to build on its technological advantages, outperforming consensus estimates for quarterly results, the long-term forecasts are too low, and the value is deeper than it appears. Although some caution has crept into the analyst's outlook, the sentiment trends remain positive and align with an uptrending share price. The activity leading into the Q2 release includes several downgrades to Hold-equivalent ratings offset by price target increases that lead to the high-end range. The consensus of 38 analysts is a high conviction Moderate Buy rating, with more than 70% rating it as a Buy. The price target forecasts a 10% upside. The high-end range puts this market near $120, another 20% upside, and both the consensus and high-end are sufficient to set fresh all-time highs. Uber’s share price slipped following the Q2 release due to the mixed results. The company outperformed on the top line, growing revenue by nearly 19% to outpace MarketBeat’s reported consensus by 185 basis points, but missed targets on the bottom line. The bottom-line miss is due to increased investment in business acquisition and growth, so it is not a major sticking point for the market. The more critical details include the 18% increase in trips and gross bookings, the 35% increase in adjusted EBITDA, the 35% increase in adjusted earnings, and $2.5 billion in free cash flow. Regarding the free cash flow and share buybacks, the Q2 results put the payout ratio at a very sustainable near-50%. Uber’s stock price uptrend is intact despite the post-release price dip. The market retreated but did not fall below a critical support target until early August. The market may consolidate at this level and move sideways in the near term, but it is unlikely to set a new low; if it does set a new low, investors should expect to see it rebound quickly. Not only are there billions in authorized buyback dollars, but the institutions have been buying robustly and will likely continue to do so. They own more than 80% of the stock and provide a solid support base and tailwind for market action.
