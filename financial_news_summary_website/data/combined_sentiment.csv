Though volumes declined due to this restructuring, EBITDA grew 74% YoY to INR1.5b, with margins at 20.4%, aided by better realizations, lower fuel costs, reduced lorry hire charges, and improved procurement efficiency (refinery sourcing at 41.5% vs. 33% YoY). Realizations are expected to remain stable, and no more pricing action is planned unless cost dynamics shift. FY26 volume growth is likely to remain flattish YoY, but FY27 is poised for 7-8% growth.

"Auto stocks snap three-day losses as Citi cites trifecta of macro tailwinds; Maruti, Hyundai rise up to 1.5%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/auto-stocks-snap-three-day-losses-as-citi-cites-trifecta-of-macro-tailwinds-maruti-hyundai-lead-gains-13541563.html,"Auto shares rebounded on Friday after three straight sessions of losses, with Maruti Suzuki India and Hyundai Motor India leading the gains, as brokerage firm Citi highlighted multiple macro triggers supportive of the sector. The Nifty Auto index rose nearly 1 percent in early trade, emerging among the top sectoral gainers. The rebound came after profit-booking in the previous three sessions, which followed four consecutive days of gains spurred by the GST Council’s decision to cut taxes on several categories of vehicles. Citi, in its note, said a combination of income tax restructuring, interest rate cuts and the recent GST rate revisions are expected to provide a favourable environment for the automobile industry, reported CNBC-TV18. The brokerage raised its price targets on key auto companies — Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd and Hyundai Motor India Ltd. It reiterated a ""buy"" rating on all three counters, projecting Maruti at Rs 17,500, M&M at Rs 4,170 and Hyundai at Rs 2,900. Maruti Suzuki remains Citi’s top pick in the sector. At around 10:45 am, shares of Maruti Suzuki were up 1.53 percent at Rs 15,326, Hyundai Motor India rose 1.33 percent to Rs 2,541.10, while Mahindra & Mahindra advanced 0.5 percent to Rs 3,612. The three stocks have gained between 10 percent and 20 percent over the past month. Citi noted that the combination of lower interest rates, tax changes and GST cuts could drive industry growth beyond its earlier projections.

The note said India's luggage industry is poised to reach Rs 26,700 crore turnover by CY28 at a CAGR of 12% between CY23-28, with established players driving the growth. ""Branded players, holding a 52% market share in CY23, are expected to outpace overall industry growth, propelled by rising disposable incomes, rapid urbanization, and resurgence in both domestic and international travel,"" said MOSL. The shift from unbranded to branded will be driven by innovation, premiumization and e-commerce, said Motilal, spurring both volume and value growth in the organized segment. MOSL cited industry observers who believe that luggage is now increasingly being seen as A 'status symbol', helped by social trends. The leading brands in India - VIP, Samsonite and Safari - together command around 33% of the market share.

The mass market of sub-Rs 4,000 luggage makes up the bulk of first-time buyers of brands at around 60 percent of the market, said MOSL, which translates into Rs 10,200 crore of turnover. This category is driven by brands like Safari, Aristocrat and Kamiliant with aggressive pricing and strong distribution network. The mid-market segment is dominated by VIP (21% share via VIP and Skybags) and American Tourister (around 17% shares), which have 'strong brand recall and omnichannel presence'. These players are targeting 'upwardly mobile, value-conscious consumers', with smart designs, seasonal launches, and curated retail formats, said MOSL. The premium segment, which is about 10% of the market, is dominated by legacy brands like Samsonite and Carlton - commanding 20 percent and 8 percent market share - that are maintaining leadership in the business and international travel segments. ""...premium luggage is evolving into a lifestyle accessory — blending status, style, and self-expression — fuelled by rising incomes, social aspirations, and the growing influence of digital culture,"" said Motilal Oswal.

The company said Apollo Strategic Technologies Pvt Ltd (ASTPL), a subsidiary of Apollo Defence Industries Pvt Ltd (ADIPL), has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Dynamic Engineering and Design Inc, USA. The pact covers technology transfer, co-development and potential licensed production of rocket motors for BM-21 Grad ER and non-ER rockets. The agreement was signed at the DSEI exhibition in London on September 10, 2025. Apollo Micro Systems said the MoU marks a step towards indigenising propulsion technologies for multi-barrel rocket systems and advancing self-reliance in defence manufacturing under the government’s Make in India initiative. The group has already developed a 122mm rocket warhead in-house and plans to begin trials shortly, with full-scale production targeted by mid-2026. The collaboration will enable integration of indigenous warheads with domestically produced rocket motors, the company added. The BM-21 Grad rockets are among the most widely used unguided rockets globally. With this initiative, Apollo Micro Systems said it will become one of the few private Indian firms to offer a fully in-house developed rocket system, strengthening India’s position in the global defence supply chain.

This is the largest ever e-bus deployment project undertaken by IFC, which is a World Bank Group entity, underscoring a rising interest to fund sustainable urban mobility projects. ""It marks IFC’s first capital investment in the e-bus sector in Asia and its largest globally, strengthening urban transport resilience across Indian cities,"" said JBM Auto. The investment is expected to speed up e-bus deployment and enhance JBM’s edge in delivering sustainable mobility solutions, the auto OEM player said. JBM Auto has been deploying zero-emission public mobility solutions across cities in India and globally across Europe, Middle East, and the APAC region. Company's Vice Chairman and MD, Nishant Arya said the funding will help JBM Auto seek more such associations in the future. ""With over 11,000 buses deployed and under execution, we are proud to have clocked 200+ Mn e-kms and served over 1 Bn passengers till date. With trusted partners like IFC, this initiative serves as a strategic beginning to many more upcoming associations towards augmenting e-bus deployment with enhanced agility and scale,"" Nishant Arya said.

Central government schemes such as PM e-Bus Sewa and PM E-DRIVE are aimign to deploy of over 52,000 e-buses across India by 2030, with a long-term plan for 1 lakh e-buses under the Bharat Urban Megabus Mission.

In India, buses make up for 70-75% of public transport journeys via 20 lakh buses in operation, which JBM Auto said is a 'major opportunity' for electrification. India's e-bus market is growing rapidly and funding for such projects will be key to realise the target of 40% EV penetration by FY30. Industry estimates have pegged India's auto component market to reach $200 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 16% from 2024.

The shares were trading at Rs 1,539.90 apiece in the early hours of the session, as investors cheered higher than expected share buyback announcement. In an exchange filing released in the post market hours of September 11, Infosys announced that the share buyback program does not exceed 25 percent of the aggregate paid-up capital and accounts for 2.41 percent of the company. The buyback price has been set at Rs 1,800 per share. This is the first buyback of shares announced by Infosys since 2022, when the company had agreed to a buyback proposal of Rs 9,300 crore. The record date for the latest buyback programme is yet to be announced. A share buyback is a programme where a company buys back some of its shares from the existing shareholders. The buyback price of Rs 1,800 apiece is more than 19 percent higher than the stock's previous closing price of Rs 1,509.70 apiece. In an exchange filing released on September 12, Infosys said that it will receive some exemptive relief from the US SEC as a result of the share buyback due to ""conflicting regulatory requirements between Indian and U.S. laws for tender offer buybacks"". The Bengaluru-based IT major had cash and cash equivalents of over Rs 42,000 crore and free cash flow of over Rs 20,000 crore in FY25, giving it ample headroom for shareholder payouts. The buyback will be funded from its free reserves, in line with its capital allocation policy of returning 85 percent of free cash flow over five years through dividends and repurchases. Infosys shares gained more than 6 percent in the past five days, and over 8 percent in the past one month. The stock has fallen nearly 3 percent in the past six months, and is down more than 18 percent in 2025 so far. Should you buy, sell or hold? CLSA kept an 'Outperform' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,861 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 23 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The buyback is expected to support stock price during the weak second half of FY26, it said. Nomura kept a 'Buy' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,880 per share. This implies an upside potential of over 24 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage expects the firm's CC revenue to grow 3.8 percent on-year in FY26. Morgan Stanley kept an 'Equal-weight' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,700 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 13 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm's buyback size was higher than the Rs 10,000–14,000 crore size initially estimated. Amid macro uncertainty around Trump tariffs, Morgan Stanley sees the buyback as a vote of confidence in stability of FY26 guidance. In the first quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026, Infosys reported an 8.7 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 6,921 crore, beating expectations. Revenue for the quarter grew 7.5 percent on-year to Rs 42,279 crore. Infosys said it expects revenue growth of 1–3 percent in constant currency terms for FY26, revised up from 0-3 percent earlier. The firm maintained its operating margin guidance at 20–22 percent.

Asia joins global equity rally after US inflation,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asia-joins-global-equity-rally-after-us-inflation-13540684.html,"Asia joined a global equity rally after relatively tame US inflation data and cooling jobs numbers clinched a path for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates next week. MSCI’s gauge of Asian shares rose for a seventh day and neared a fresh record, after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes both climbed to fresh closing highs in New York. A gauge of global stocks also hit a new record. Contracts for US equities were little changed Friday. Microsoft Corp. shares climbed in post-market trading after the tech giant and OpenAI said they had reached an agreement, while Adobe Inc. shares also advanced in extended trading after it gave a strong quarterly revenue outlook. Elsewhere, Hyundai Motor Co. said a battery plant that was raided by US immigration authorities is being delayed as the companies faced labor shortages. US consumer price index data showed core prices that strip out food and energy rose 0.3% in August and 3.1% from a year earlier, in line with economists forecasts. Alongside that report came jobless-claims figures, which jumped to the highest in almost four years, emboldening bets policymakers will lower rates at its Sept. 16-17 meeting in an effort to counter a rapid slowdown in the labor market. “Inflation is relatively calm, which gives the Fed the flexibility to focus more on stemming ongoing weakness in the labor market,” said Skyler Weinand at Regan Capital. “We expect the Fed to cut 25 basis points next week and to follow through with another two 25 basis-point cuts this year.” Treasuries broadly held on to gains made on Thursday when the US 10-year yield fell two basis points. Australian and New Zealand yields fell Friday, echoing the move. Bloomberg’s index of the dollar was steady. Gold stabilized after a small Thursday decline after eclipsing its inflation-adjusted peak set in 1980. In Asia, data on the docket for release includes industrial production for Japan and inflation for India. Money supply and new loans data for China may be released any time through Sept. 15. In China, investors will be closely watching the Hong Kong-listed shares in Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. after the company’s US-listed depositary receipts rallied 8% Thursday. Elsewhere, oil fell for a second day as a worsening market outlook undercut concerns about potential geopolitical disruptions to supplies. US Rate Cuts A slowing US jobs market has prompted markets to price a more aggressive trajectory of policy easing. Swaps pricing indicates traders anticipate the equivalent of between two or three 25 basis point cuts through year-end. “Right now, inflation is a key subplot, but the labor market is still the main story,” said Ellen Zentner at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. Thursday’s “CPI may appear to offset yesterday’s PPI, but it wasn’t hot enough to distract the Fed from the softening jobs picture. That translates into a rate cut next week — and, likely, more to come.” While there may be some murmurs within the Fed about the need for a 50 basis-point cut, an emergency-sized reduction is not required, said Seema Shah at Principal Asset Management. Jobless claims are still quite low compared to 2021 levels, while the broader economic activity data and earnings reports do not signal the US is approaching a recessionary tipping point.","MSCI’s gauge of Asian shares rose for a seventh day and neared a fresh record, after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes both climbed to fresh closing highs in New York.","That translates into a rate cut next week — and, likely, more to come.” While there may be some murmurs within the Fed about the need for a 50 basis-point cut, an emergency-sized reduction is not required, said Seema Shah at Principal Asset Management.","Elsewhere, Hyundai Motor Co. said a battery plant that was raided by US immigration authorities is being delayed as the companies faced labor shortages.","That translates into a rate cut next week — and, likely, more to come.” While there may be some murmurs within the Fed about the need for a 50 basis-point cut, an emergency-sized reduction is not required, said Seema Shah at Principal Asset Management.",negative,0.7034310698509216

About 1,406 shares declined against 1,360 advancing shares on the NSE. The market is expected to extend its bullish bias, given favourable technical and momentum indicators. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking Berger Paints | CMP: Rs 551.35 Berger Paints saw a breakout from its prolonged consolidation range on the daily chart, supported by a noticeable surge in volumes. This breakout, coupled with a strong close, indicates fresh buying interest and suggests the possibility of a trend reversal. The stock has also crossed above its 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs, which further confirms a shift in its market structure towards a bullish bias. Momentum indicators align with this view as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 54.17, showing early signs of a positive crossover and strengthening momentum.

The momentum setup also supports this view, as the RSI stands at 60.74 and is showing an upward curve, suggesting strengthening momentum.

Click to View More Outlook for September 12 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets traded in a subdued manner on Thursday and ended marginally higher, taking a breather after the recent surge. After a positive start, the Nifty moved in a narrow range throughout the session and finally settled at 25,005.5 level. Sectoral performance was mixed, with energy and pharma emerging as top gainers, while IT and auto witnessed profit booking. Meanwhile, the broader indices remained largely flat, underperforming the large-cap space. It appears that markets have absorbed the initial reaction to favorable developments such as GST reforms and optimism around US–India trade talks, and may now witness a brief pause. However, rotational buying across key sectors and early signs of a reversal in themes like defense and railways are likely to keep the undertone positive. Amid this backdrop, we continue to advocate a “buy on dips” strategy in the index and suggest focusing on accumulating quality names across sectors and themes that are moving in line with the benchmark. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities The upmove with range bound action continued in the market on Thursday and Nifty closed the day with modest gains of 30 points. After opening on a negative note, the market recovered initially but later shifted into a usual small range movement and that continued till the end. A small positive candle was formed on the daily chart with minor upper shadow. Technically this action signals a range bound action in the market. Though, Nifty placed at the crucial hurdle of 25000 mark (down sloping trend line and previous two weeks highs) but not showing any strength to witness a decisive break out of the hurdle. The recent opening upside gap of 9th and 10th Sept remains unfilled. The underlying trend of Nifty remains positive with choppy movement. Any failure to move sharply above the important resistance of 25000-25100 levels in the next 1-2 sessions could open short term weakness in the market. Immediate support is at 24800.

This comes as reports on further consolidation of these lenders boosted investor sentiment. The Nifty PSU Bank index rose nearly 1 percent to 7,089, extending gains for the second consecutive session. The government is expected to revisit the consolidation plans of these PSBs in an effort to create larger and more globally competitive lenders, The Economic Times reported on September 10, citing sources. The issue will be taken up at the upcoming PSB Manthan which is scheduled to begin tomorrow, it added. The last major round of restructuring in 2019-2020 had brought down the number of state-run lenders from 27 to 12. A senior official told ET that while there is a recognized need for Indian banks to scale up globally, any new round of consolidation will depend on synergies and consultations with the lenders themselves. The aim would be to form at least three to four very large banks, it added. ET further reported that the two-day summit will also include discussions between PSBs and key infrastructure financing entities such as the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) and India Infrastructure Finance Company (IIFCL). Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Canara Bank shares were the top gainers on the index, rising nearly 2 percent each. UCO Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank (PSB), Bank of Maharashtra and Bank of India shares rose more than 1 percent each. Union Bank of India, Central Bank of India and State Bank of India (SBI) shares rose nearly 1 percent each, while Indian Bank, Bank of Baroda and Indian Overseas Bank shares were hovering in the green with marginal gains. As of the June quarter, four public sector banks, which are UCO Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, and Central Bank of India, had government shareholding levels exceeding 90 percent. In 2019, the government initiated a large-scale consolidation drive in the PSU banking space, merging 10 public sector lenders into four larger entities.

Renewable energy (~237 GW, 49% share) has surpassed thermal capacity (~220 GW, 44% share), where RE and thermal grew at 10.9% and 6.5% CAGR, respectively, over the past 15 years. Despite decarbonization efforts, coal remains a critical source for India’s power demand, contributing ~65-75% of power generation. Therefore, with rising industrial/household activity, coal demand is expected to remain firm. Coal India (COAL) accounts for over ~70% of the total coal production in India (including captives/others), of which over 80% is supplied to the power sector, positioning it as a dominant player in the coal mining space. COAL’s earnings are expected to remain under pressure in FY26, driven by a lack of volume growth amid muted power demand as well as the rising share of captive/merchant mining during Apr-Jul’25. Moreover, subdued global coal prices will continue to cap COAL’s e-auction prices/demand. Outlook At CMP, the stock is trading at 4x on FY27E EV/EBITDA at its 10-year historical average.

This comes as investors may have resorted to profit booking, a day after the stocks recorded massive gains. The stocks had seen significant surge on September 10 (Wednesday) after US President Donald Trump said Washington and New Delhi will resume negotiations to resolve the ongoing trade frictions. Apex Frozen Foods shares dropped over 4 percent to trade at Rs 246.28 apiece in the morning, while those of Avanti Feeds plunged 4 percent to trade at Rs 728.60 apiece. The two stocks had rallied 17 percent and 15 percent respectively yesterday. Among the textile stocks, Welspun Living shares dropped over 2 percent to trade at Rs 122.50 apiece. Raymond Lifestyle shares meanwhile fell nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 1,286 apiece. The stocks had jumped 10 percent and 2 percent respectively the previous day. In a social media post on Truth Social, Trump announced, ""I am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations."" ""I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the upcoming weeks. I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!"" he further wrote. The shares of these export-oriented companies had significantly declined earlier after the Trump administration increased tariffs on Indian imports to a whopping 50 percent, citing New Delhi's continued purchase of Russian oil. However, Trump's latest comment may have boosted investor sentiment on the possibility of the two countries concluding their long-awaited tariff deal.

Nomura sees 30 percent upside for Gail India on one-time boost from tariff hike and petchem recovery,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nomura-sees-30-percent-upside-for-gail-india-on-one-time-boost-from-tariff-hike-and-petchem-recovery-13538349.html,"Shares of Gail India are higher by over 2.5 percent to be the top F&O gainer in the trading session on September 11, after brokerage Nomura issued a Buy call with a target of Rs 225 per share, which is nearly 30 percent higher than the last closing price, projecting that the company will get a one-time benefit from the proposed tariff hikes. Nomura said a tariff hike could provide a one-time boost to Gail India, with an integrated tariff increase of over 20 percent could potentially surprise investors on the upside. The note also said that Gail's petchem segment is expected to start seeing a recovery from FY27e onwards, contributing to the high investor interest in the stock. Gail India has already seen volumes of 55 lakh shares, at more than half of its one-month and one-week average. On a YTD basis, shares of Gail India are lower by 6.7 percent, and over the last one year, the shares are down 18 percent. However, over the last three years, Gail India shares are higher by 93 percent. The month of September has traditionally been positive for the stock, with the company delivering positive returns in 13 out of last 17 years during the month. The company has submitted a request to Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) for a 33 percent increase in gas tariff to Rs 78/mmbtu, citing rising cost of substitute gas used by compressors in pipeline operations, since gas allocation under Administered Price Mechanism (APM) has been cut to zero. Also, the capacity determination by PNGRB for GAIL’s integrated pipeline has come out to be lower than previously expected. Gail's revenue from operations from natural gas transmission in FY25 rose by 7 percent on year to Rs 11,068 crore due to increase in transmission volume and upward revision in tariffs. The company has a near 65 percent share in India's natural gas transmission. Nomura said it expects tariffs to be revised to around Rs 70/mmbtu with effect from April 2026, which is an increase of 19.5 percent. According to the note, this should translate into a 42 percent on year rise in gas transmission EBIT during FY27e, and the consolidated group EBIT is expected to rise by 24 percent. Gail is India's largest state-run natural gas processing and distribution company, with interests in domestic and overseas oil and gas assets, renewable energy and City Gas Distribution as well as Compressed Biogas. The regulator is in the process of finalising the integrated tariff of Gail India, which is an integral part of the 'Unified Tariff'.

Wipro, HCL Technologies, Tech Mahindra and Mphasis also traded lower, slipping up to 1.3 percent. Tata Consultancy Services was the sole gainer, edging up 0.14 percent. The recent rally in IT shares was fuelled by expectations of a Fed rate cut and easing trade concerns after US President Donald Trump said Washington and New Delhi would resume talks to resolve trade differences. Indian IT firms derive a significant share of their revenue from the US market. However, sentiment turned cautious as investors awaited US consumer price index (CPI) data, due later in the day, following weaker-than-expected producer price numbers. A Reuters poll projected CPI to rise 0.3 percent month-on-month in August, after a 0.2 percent increase in July. On a year-on-year basis, CPI was seen at 2.9 percent versus 2.7 percent in July.

Patanjali Foods shares adjust to 2:1 bonus issue: Here's why you should ignore the 67% plunge,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/patanjali-foods-shares-adjust-to-2-1-bonus-issue-here-s-why-you-should-ignore-the-67-plunge-13538309.html,"The shares of Patanjali Foods appeared to have fallen nearly 67 percent in one single session on September 11, as the stock price adjusted to a bonus issue of shares. The stock was actually trading in the red with marginal losses at Rs 596 apiece. Patanjali Foods' board of directors during a meeting in July had approved the issue of bonus shares in the ratio of 2:1. The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the bonus equity shares was set on September 11. A company announces bonus issue of shares to reward its existing shareholders with an investment opportunity, which is perceived to be attractive. While the issue of bonus shares increases the total number of shares issued and owned, it does not change the market capitalization of the company. This increases the overall liquidity of the stock, and makes it more affordable for other investors to add to their portfolio, creating strong upside potential for the stock. As a result, Patanjali Foods shares appeared to have crashed 67 percent in one session, while in reality, they simply adjusted to the bonus issue. After the issuance of bonus shares, the company's market capitalization stands at around Rs 64,856 crore and the stock's P/E ratio nears 18. The issuance of bonus shares will likely increase investors' confidence for the stock, as it reflects on the firm's strong financials and growth potential. Bonus issue essentially are free shares offered by a company from its reserves. Investors must own shares of the company as on the record date to be eligible for the bonus issue.

Decision on Infosys buyback closely watched as board considers first proposal in three years,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/decision-on-infosys-buyback-closely-watched-as-board-considers-first-proposal-in-three-years-13538243.html,"Investors will closely track for updates as the board of IT major Infosys convenes today to consider a proposal for share buyback, which will be the first one in three years, and fifth in last eight years. Shares of the company opened quiet on September 11 but slipped nearly a percent lower to be the top loser on Nifty 50. The shares have gained 2.6 percent in last one week and 6.6 percent over last one month, while on a YTD basis, shares of Infosys are lower by 19 percent. Market participants will be closely watching for the size of the buyback and how much of its cash reserves will the company deploy to purchases shares from investors. Also on radar will be the premium that the company will offer in order to buy back the shares. The timing of the buyback is also interesting, coming at a time for ongoing tariffs by US President Trump on Indian exports, and when the US economy has been facing risks of a slowdown, and amid calls of curb on US H1-B visas among Trump's supporters. In a recent note, Morgan Stanley has said that it sees a buyback of around Rs 10,000-14,000 crore by Infosys, coming in at around 18-25 percent premium to the current price. As of June 2025, Infosys was sitting on cash on books worth Rs 24,500 crore. Infosys has a high cash-generating business with access to global capital. The company's primary source of funds is cash from operations and income from short and long-term investments, among others. ""Our strong performance on the back of meticulous execution over the years, as reflected in the combination of high growth, strong cash generation and profitability, has led to building a strong, debt-free, and liquid Balance Sheet,"" the company had said in its annual report for FY25. The company has returned nearly Rs 88,400 crore, or 85% of the cumulative free cash flow between FY20-24 through dividends and buybacks, as part of its capital allocation policy. During the year ended March 31, 2025, Infosys paid an interim dividend of Rs 21 per share and announced a final dividend of Rs 22 per share. In the last five years preceding FY25, Infosys had purchased and extinguished a total of 11.62 crore fully paid-up equity shares from stock exchanges. The company has only one class of equity shares and even ADR holders are eligible for the buyback. Motilal Oswal has a Neutral call on Infosys with a target price of Rs 1750, and Prabhudas Lilladher has an Accumulate call with the same target. The IT space has not seen a buyback from the top-tier names in the last two years, and both Wipro and TCS are eligible to come out with their own, thus Infosys' board decision a closely watched by market participants. Both TCS and Wipro have conducted five buybacks each between 2016-2023, whereas Infosys has carried out four buybacks since 2017. The IT services major had revised its full-year revenue growth guidance for FY26 to 1-3 percent growth in constant currency (CC), increasing the lower end of the range.

Track the latest updates on GIFT Nifty right here on Moneycontrol. Indian benchmark indices extended the previous session gains with Nifty crossing 25,000 intraday on September 10, led by IT, financial, realty names. However, profit booking in auto and media stocks erased some of the intraday gains. At close, the Sensex was up 323.83 points or 0.40 percent at 81,425.15, and the Nifty was up 104.5 points or 0.42 percent at 24,973.10. BSE midcap and smallcap indices rose 0.7% each. Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Up) The GIFT Nifty is trading marginally higher at around 25,089.50, indicating a muted start for the day. Asian Equities (Gain) Asian equities were mixed Thursday after a rally on Wall Street drove stocks and bonds higher, as a drop in producer prices supported bets the Federal Reserve will resume cutting interest rates next week. US Equities (Mixed) The S&P 500 and Nasdaq notched record-high closes on Wednesday, as Oracle surged and cooler-than-expected inflation data supported expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week. Oracle soared 36% in its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1992 after the tech company pointed to a demand surge from AI firms for its cloud services. The S&P 500 climbed 0.30% to end the session at 6,532.04 points, closing with a record high for the second straight day. The Nasdaq gained 0.03% to 21,886.06 points for its third consecutive record-high close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.48% to 45,490.92 points US Bond Yield (Mixed) The yield on 10-year Treasuries were up marginally while 2-year Treasuries were down marginally in the early trade on Thursday. Dollar Index (Flat) The dollar stabilised in early Asian trading hours on Thursday after an unexpected drop in U.S. factory-gate prices bolstered expectations the Federal Reserve will cut rates next week and traders awaited U.S. consumer price data due later in the day. Asian currencies (Gain) Asian currencies were trading lower in the early Thursday trade with Taiwan Dollar leading the gainers. However, year-to-date basis, except Indonesian Rupiah, all other currencies were trading higher. Crude (Flat) Oil steadied after a three-day gain as investors weighed Donald Trump’s latest comments regardingRussia and whether the US president will follow through with measures to punish Moscow for the Ukraine war. Gold (Up) Gold steadied just below a record after a surprise drop in US producer prices supported the case for the Federal Reserve to ease policy. Fund Flow Action The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold equities worth Rs 115 crore on September 10, while Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) purchased equities worth Rs 5004 crore on the same day.

Asian shares steady as US stocks climb into CPI,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-shares-steady-as-us-stocks-climb-into-cpi-13537347.html,"Asian equities were mixed Thursday after a rally on Wall Street drove stocks and bonds higher, as a drop in producer prices supported bets the Federal Reserve will resume cutting interest rates next week. Shares in Australia fell while those in Japan swung between gains and losses in early trading. US futures edged higher after the S&P 500 rose 0.3% to a new record Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 ended the session fractionally higher. Treasuries were steady after a rally across the curve Wednesday, while Australian and New Zealand government bonds rose Thursday. An index of the dollar was little changed while the yen strengthened against the greenback early Thursday. The Wednesday moves in the US reflected fresh optimism that the Fed will cut rates next week after producer prices unexpectedly declined for the first time in four months. The data soothed worries that elevated inflation would create a challenge for policymakers trying prevent a jobs downturn ahead of US inflation figures due later Thursday. “Investors are now contemplating the extent to which August’s payrolls, the benchmark revisions, and PPI should drive a conversation about a 50 basis-point cut next week,” said Ian Lyngen and Vail Hartman at BMO Capital Markets. “We are still in the 25 basis-point cut camp. For a half-point to be a real possibility, tomorrow’s core-CPI move will need to underwhelm.” Monthly US producer prices excluding food and energy declined 0.1% in August from the prior month, falling short of consensus estimates of a 0.3% increase, while July’s figure was also revised down. The data may indicate firms are trying to stay competitive to maintain market-share, said Neil Dutta at Renaissance Macro Research. “The Fed should cut 50 basis points next week — but I don’t think they will,” Dutta said. “The doves on the FOMC have a very strong case to make. The hawks will argue that the unemployment rate is still low, financial conditions are loose, and that there is still upward inflation pressure in front of us due to tariffs.” In Asia, data set for release Thursday includes inflation expectations in Australia and industrial production in Malaysia. Later Thursday, the European Central Bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is seeking to raise $3.17 billion in an offering of zero-coupon convertible notes that’s set to be the year’s biggest, according to terms of the deal seen by Bloomberg News. The company’s ADRs fell 2.2% in New York trading Wednesday. Elsewhere, US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to talk and resume trade negotiations, signaling a possible thaw after weeks of a blistering fight over tariffs and Russian oil purchases. US Inflation Core CPI, a measure of underlying inflation excluding food and fuel, probably rose 0.3% for a second month, according to the Bloomberg survey median estimate. A weaker-than-expected reading may prompt further speculation for a 50 basis point Fed cut next week. The combination of a moderation in jobs growth and still-manageable inflation should keep the Fed on track to cut rates, with a 25-basis-point cut expected in September to be followed by three additional consecutive cuts of the same size by January 2026, according to Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi at UBS Global Wealth Management. “Tomorrow’s CPI will carry more weight, but today’s PPI print essentially rolled out the red carpet for a Fed rate cut next week,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “After last week’s jobs report, though, the market was already expecting the Fed to begin an easing cycle, so it remains to be seen how much of a near-term impact this will have on sentiment.” In commodities, gold rose early Thursday after gains in the prior session and oil rose for a fourth day as investors weighed Trump’s next moves to pressure Russia, raising concerns over crude supplies. Meanwhile, Mexico is looking to apply tariffs of as much as 50% on cars, auto parts, steel and textiles from China and other countries with which it does not have a trade agreement, according to Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard.","The hawks will argue that the unemployment rate is still low, financial conditions are loose, and that there is still upward inflation pressure in front of us due to tariffs.” In Asia, data set for release Thursday includes inflation expectations in Australia and industrial production in Malaysia.","“After last week’s jobs report, though, the market was already expecting the Fed to begin an easing cycle, so it remains to be seen how much of a near-term impact this will have on sentiment.” In commodities, gold rose early Thursday after gains in the prior session and oil rose for a fourth day as investors weighed Trump’s next moves to pressure Russia, raising concerns over crude supplies.","Treasuries were steady after a rally across the curve Wednesday, while Australian and New Zealand government bonds rose Thursday.","“After last week’s jobs report, though, the market was already expecting the Fed to begin an easing cycle, so it remains to be seen how much of a near-term impact this will have on sentiment.” In commodities, gold rose early Thursday after gains in the prior session and oil rose for a fourth day as investors weighed Trump’s next moves to pressure Russia, raising concerns over crude supplies.",positive,0.7842376232147217
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Wipro, NLC India, Bharat Electronics, Mazagon Dock, VIP Industries, Hindustan Aeronautics, and others on September 11?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-wipro-nlc-india-bharat-electronics-mazagon-dock-vip-industries-hindustan-aeronautics-and-others-on-september-11-13537333.html,"The momentum sustained in equity benchmarks that gained 0.4 percent on September 10, with positive market breadth. A total of 1,692 shares advanced compared to 1,083 declining shares on the NSE. The trend is likely to be upward despite consolidation (if any), as frontline indices now trade above all key moving averages. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities NLC India | CMP: Rs 248.62 NLC India has broken out above Rs 232 with a strong bullish candle and rising volumes. The stock closed above the 21EMA, indicating strength. RSI has turned up from lower levels, confirming bullish momentum. In the near term, a sustained move above Rs 250 may lead towards Rs 265–270, while support lies at Rs 237. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 270 Stop-Loss: Rs 237 Bharat Electronics | CMP: Rs 388 Bharat Electronics rallied 4.3% on Wednesday, marking a strong rebound after a brief consolidation phase. The stock formed a long bullish candle with volumes picking up, indicating renewed buying interest. On the indicator front, RSI (14) has given a sharp bounce from lower levels and crossed above the midline, showing strengthening momentum. With price recovering towards the 21-day EMA, sustained trade above Rs 390 could open the way for further upside, while support is placed at Rs 378 on the lower side. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 410 Stop-Loss: Rs 378 Nilesh Jain, Head – Technical and Derivatives Research Analyst (Equity Research) at Centrum Broking Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders | CMP: Rs 2,755.3 Mazagon Dock formed a good base formation and also found strong support at the 200-DMA, placed at Rs 2,685 levels. Earlier, we saw a lot of underperformance and short build-up in this space, and now we have started witnessing short covering, which indicates a sentimental change in this space. On the technical front, we have seen a breakout from a falling trendline with higher-than-average volumes. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,590 Wipro | CMP: Rs 255.75 The Nifty IT index has formed a strong base and is rebounding from oversold levels. Wipro has given a breakout from an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern on the daily chart, backed by strong trading volumes. Momentum indicators and oscillators have confirmed a bullish crossover, and the RSI has also broken above a falling trendline, strengthening the positive view. Based on this setup, the stock is likely to move towards Rs 286 in the near term, with support placed at Rs 242, near the right shoulder of the pattern. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 286 Stop-Loss: Rs 242 VIP Industries | CMP: Rs 447.7 VIP Industries has broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart, indicating a continuation of its upward trend. The breakout was accompanied by strong volumes, reflecting solid underlying strength. Based on the pattern, the target is estimated around Rs 495, with immediate support at Rs 425. Considering these technical signals, the stock is expected to sustain its positive momentum in the short term, and a buy-on-dips strategy is advised. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 495 Stop-Loss: Rs 425 Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivative Research Analyst at Samco Securities Mankind Pharma | CMP: Rs 2,608.5 Mankind Pharma has displayed notable strength over the last three consecutive sessions, moving higher while respecting the rising trendline support. The stock is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, and price action is now on the verge of a decisive breakout as it tests the upper trendline. Importantly, the consolidation phase has been accompanied by subdued volumes, suggesting accumulation at current levels rather than distribution. The stock is also sustaining above its 20-EMA and 50-EMA, which underpins a constructive bias. Momentum indicators are turning favourable, with the RSI climbing to 59 and forming higher lows—a sign of strengthening momentum and persistent buying at dips. The narrowing price action near the triangle apex further indicates that a strong directional move is imminent. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,875 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,460 Hindustan Aeronautics | CMP: Rs 4,557.5 Hindustan Aeronautics has shown a strong rebound from its key demand zone near Rs 4,250–4,300, where it formed a solid base over the past few weeks. In the latest session, the stock broke above its falling trendline resistance with a strong bullish candle, supported by a notable rise in volumes, confirming fresh buying interest. The stock is also trading back above its 20-EMA and 200-EMA, signaling a positive shift in trend after a prolonged consolidation. The RSI has surged to 56, making a sharp higher low, which reflects improving momentum and strengthening bullish sentiment. The breakout from the consolidation zone after multiple retests indicates that supply absorption has likely occurred, setting the stage for a sustained up-move. The price action suggests the possibility of further gains in the near term, as improving momentum and volume-backed breakout reinforce a bullish outlook in the short to medium term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,950 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,350 Indraprastha Gas | CMP: Rs 211.33 IGL has shown resilience around the key support zone of Rs 207–210, where it has respected the ascending trendline support and 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level. The stock has witnessed a healthy pullback from this support area, reflecting strong buying interest at lower levels. Currently, the stock is trading above its 20-EMA and 50-EMA while maintaining its higher-low structure, which indicates a sustained bullish undertone. The RSI is placed near 55, rebounding from the neutral zone, suggesting improving momentum and scope for further upside. The recent consolidation breakout and retest near support reinforce the view that supply has been absorbed, paving the way for a continuation of the uptrend. The stock can pick up momentum on a sustained move above Rs 212, which would further strengthen the bullish bias.

Additionally, after a long time, Nifty succeeded in closing above the 50-day SMA (Simple Moving Average), which is largely a positive sign. We are of the view that the 50-day SMA/24920/81200 and the 24,800/81000 level will act as key support zones for traders. As long as the market trades above these levels, the bullish sentiment is likely to continue. On the higher side, the index could move up to 25,100–25,200/81700-82000.

Its manufacturing and research and development facilities are located in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The consolidated revenue of Divi’s increased 13.8% YoY to Rs. 2,410cr in Q1FY26 but exhibited a sequential decline of 7% primarily due to pricing pressures in the generic division. Though the company reported steady performance this quarter, led by growth in custom synthesis, the pricing pressure in the generics segment and higher logistics and shipping costs dragged down gross margins. EBITDA grew 17.2% YoY to Rs. 729cr and the margin increased 90bps. However, it sequentially declined 18% due to pricing pressures and logistics costs. The custom synthesis segment grew 23.1% YoY to Rs.1,277cr, supported by multiple projects across R&D, pilot, and validation stages. However, near-term challenges may arise from generic competition in Entresto. Outlook Divi’s also faces the risk of losing business related to sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto), adding to competitive pressures. The company is also trading at a premium valuation.

Buy Apex Frozen Foods; target of Rs 284: Geojit Financial Services,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-apex-frozen-foods-target-of-rs-284-geojit-financial-services-13535827.html,"Geojit Financial Services research report on Apex Frozen Foods Apex Frozen Foods Ltd. (Apex) is a South India (Andhra Pradesh) based exporter of processed shrimps with a capacity of 34,240MT. In Q1FY26, revenue increased 39% YoY to Rs.258cr, supported by 17% growth in volumes and a 19% improvement in realisations, partly aided by INR depreciation. Gross margin rose 140 bps YoY to 32.9% YoY, while EBITDA margin widened 30 bps YoY to 6.0%. However, profitability remains below pre-Covid levels of ~10– 11%, primarily due to softer realizations and elevated farm-gate costs. Recently, the US imposed a 50% tariff along with a 5.77% countervailing duty on Indian exports. This development poses a major headwind for India’s export sector, while trade negotiations between the two countries are still underway. Apex has been actively diversifying its market presence, helping mitigate risks from a high US dependency amid tariff challenges. The contribution of non-US markets to total sales has risen to ~45%, up from ~24% over the past seven years. Outlook Expect revenue/EBITDA to grow at 13%/85%, respectively, over FY25-27E. We value Apex at 17X P/E and recommend BUY rating with a revised target price of Rs. 284.

Vodafone Idea shares rise 3 percent after moving petition before SC against DoT's calculation of fresh AGR dues,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vodafone-idea-shares-rise-3-percent-after-moving-petition-before-sc-against-dot-s-calculation-of-fresh-agr-dues-13535703.html,"Shares of telecom major Vodafone Idea jumped more than 3 percent on September 10, a day after it was reported that the company has filed a petition before the Supreme Court, challenging DoT's calculation of fresh AGR dues amounting to Rs 9,450 crore. The shares of the company hit an intraday high of Rs 7.51 per share but later pared gains to trade over a percent higher in mid-day trade. Vodafone Idea shares have now been higher in five out of six straight sessions, rising more than 15 percent in September so far. The stock has recovered nearly 23 percent after hitting a 52-week low of Rs 6.12 apiece in August this year, however it is still down around 45.5 percent from its 52-week high of Rs 13.77 per share hit a year ago. Vodafone Idea urged Supreme Court to quash an additional Rs 9,450 crore AGR demand by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), alleging that the fresh dues exceed the scope of the Court's earlier ruling on AGR liabilities. The telecom operator's petition challenged DoT's revised calculations which covered dues up to FY17 and the updated licence fee obligations for both the Idea Cellular group and Vodafone Idea Limited through FY19. These revised dues fall under the government's moratorium on AGR payments, which ends on March 31 next year, after which, Vodafone Idea will have to begin making instalments. As part of its latest assessment, the DoT has raised an extra demand of Rs 2,774 crore for FY18-19. Vodafone Idea claimed that certain amounts have been added twice and need reconciliation. The company has asked for a recalculation of dues, starting from the pre-FY17 period. According to the petition, out of the total Re 9,450 crore demand, Rs 2,774 crore pertains to the post-merger entity — Idea Group and Vodafone Idea — following their August 2018 consolidation, while Rs 5,675 crore relates to the pre-merger Vodafone Group's liabilities. The Supreme Court in March, 2020 locked Vodafone Idea's AGR dues till 2016-17 based on calculations by the department of telecommunications (DoT), adding that no self-assessment or re-assessment of the dues would be permitted. However, DoT had sought additional payments for up to 2018-19, Vodafone Idea said in its petition dated September 8. The telecom operator owes about Rs 83,400 crore in AGR dues to the government, with annual payments of Rs 18,000 crore beginning in March. Overall, Vodafone Idea’s total dues to the government stand at around Rs 2 trillion, including penalty and interest.

"IT stocks rally for 2nd day: OFSS, Wipro, others rise up to 8% on hopes over US trade talks, Fed rate cut",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/it-stocks-rally-for-2nd-day-ofss-wipro-others-rise-up-to-8-on-hopes-over-us-trade-talks-fed-rate-cuts-13534826.html,"The shares of IT companies sharply gained on September 10, pushing the sectoral index up more than 2 percent in the morning. The Nifty IT index led gains among the major sectoral indices, extending strong gains for the second consecutive session after five-day losing streak. The IT index rose to 36,075.95 in the morning. Here are the possible triggers for today's sharp rise: Trump says India-US trade talks to resume: The sharp rise in the IT stocks today was fuelled after US President Donald Trump said Washington and New Delhi will resume negotiations to resolve the ongoing trade frictions. In a social media post on Truth Social, Trump announced, ""I am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations."" ""I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the upcoming weeks. I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!"" he further wrote. While the tariffs were not implemented on IT services, the easing trade tensions between India and US will likely benefit the IT companies which derive major portion of their revenue from the American markets. Rising hopes for Fed rate cut: The US Federal Reserve is set to hold its FOMC meeting from September 16 to September 17. Analysts increasingly expect the American central bank to cut its rates this time, amid weakening jobs data and rising pressure from President Donald Trump's administration. The US economy likely created 911,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March than previously estimated, according to the latest data from Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. This further hiked rate cut hopes. A rate cut in the US will likely increase the discretionary spending capacity, which will likely help the IT companies which derive a major portion of their revenue from the American market. The IT stocks had surged yesterday as well, led by Infosys. This came after the company announced that its board will meet on September 11 to consider a proposal for buyback of fully paid-up equity shares. If approved, this will be the first buyback of shares announced by India's second-largest IT firm since 2022, when the company had agreed to a buyback proposal of Rs 9,300 crore with a minimum buyback price of Rs 1,850 per share. Oracle Financial Services Software (OFSS) shares were the top gainer on the Nifty IT index, rising nearly 8 percent. This comes after its parent company and NYSE-listed Oracle Corp issued an ambitious outlook for its cloud business, sending its shares to a record high. The company also announced huge layoffs. Persistent Systems shares jumped nearly 5 percent, while Mphasis shares were up 4 percent. Coforge and LTI Mindtree shares gained more than 3 percent each, while Wipro, HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra shares rose over 2 percent each. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares gained nearly 2 percent, while Infosys shares were up more than 1 percent. What lies ahead? ""The dual tailwinds from GST rationalization and anticipation of a U.S. Fed rate reduction are acting as a long-needed support to Indian equities, insulating them from global tariff and demand uncertainties,"" said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara Pvt. Ltd. ""Though the IT industry has taken a hit this year, these decisions are evidence of resilience and the industry's core position in India's growth narrative. To investors, it is a reminder that long-term value resides in remaining aligned to structural pillars, even in times of short-term churn,"" the analyst added. Bhavik Joshi, Business Head, INVasset PMS, however advised caution. ""Foreign investors remain cautious, discouraging a sustained rally. While local policy cues and GST relief offer seasonal optimism, the lack of a sharp earnings turnaround or acceleration in contract wins keeps sentiment muted. The buyback announcement from Infosys may provide a short-lived jolt, yet the broader narrative remains one of structural caution rather than exuberance,"" he said. ""In essence, what separates IT from other sectors today is the 'global tether'. The expectation of a U.S. rate cut may lift overall market sentiment, but until global tech spend and deal pipelines visibly recover, IT will lag broader indices. For now, this underperformance reflects prudence—not weakness—and positions IT for a selective comeback once global visibility returns,"" he added. Renewed optimism around capital allocation, coupled with easing rate-cut expectations globally, fueled broad-based gains across the sector, said Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking. ""However, participants shouldn't get carried away with a single day move and should wait for some signs of stability citing the prolonged underperformance,"" he added.
